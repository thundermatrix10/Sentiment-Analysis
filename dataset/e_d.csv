review,note
"Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!",0
not that good,0
"""you can't get reminder if notification off"" ... I know what I'm doing, it's extremely inconvenient to show a pop-up warning everytime the app is opened!",0
The widget is not syncing properly across devices. I have one device saying that an event due today is not due until tomorrow. Another device correctly says due today. Hitting the refresh icon does not clear the problem. Opening the actual app shows correct details. Widgets across the entire Outlook suite are unreliable.,0
It Has Less Emoji. And need to alarm the phone. So that at particular time I can behin it,0
no hourly reminder,0
I can expand a group and see all lists. But how do I expand a list while staying in group view?,0
"When all one wants is a daily checklist, it's irritating to go into each task and skip to current task. If a task repeats why would I want it to stay forever under the completed. It becomes too much of a hassle to keep clearing the completed ones.",0
Can reorder tasks but not flagged email tasks?,0
"By press the button ""refresh"" I see ""Your offline"".always",0
Sometimes synching doesn't work in three Android app,0
"Por favor, coloquem mais op√ß√µes de widget!! A integra√ß√£o √© incr√≠vel, mas a brutalidade de um √∫nico widget gigantesco na tela √© desagrad√°vel. Sugest√£o: possibilitem diminuir o tamanho do widget.",0
"Its ok, though doesnt send reminders",0
Please make it work with passwordless login.,0
"this app often missed to show notification. at first i thought probably android kill the app in background to save battery, so i often open the app many times within day. even then, still in many occasion the notification fails to show. please fix it.",0
"so worked amazing the first week, app interface is good, design is good, everything is good. then bam, next week can't see any of my tasks on the widget, won't refresh have to keep going on deleting the widget then adding then deleting to get the tasks to refresh despite adding new tasks everyday so yeah no point in having a to do list that literally doesn't refresh yk",0
"When it is skipped to the current tasks, it will skip to the next week, even though the due dates have been customised to days within the week that haven't arrived yet.",0
Forces you to log in with password with browser,0
Lack of features,0
Half the features of the desktop version with a completely different UI. Painful to use.,0
"The Outlook categories are not appear in the app , I hope you fix this soon üôè",0
I really enjoyed this app and used it daily. I would have given it a higher rating but it seems they removed the ability to add a home screen shortcut to individual lists. It has decreased its usefulness.,0
No subtasks,0
I really like the app itself but ever since I got a new phone it prompts me to turn on notifications every time I open it. I don't want notifications. I turned them off for a reason. The prompt is annoying enough that I'm gonna find another to do list app.,0
My Day - SORT BY DUE DATE is not ACCURATE. It listed tasks randomly regardless of due date.,0
"There's quite a lot of work to do with this app. While it seems to functionally work well on a basic level, a lot of core features from the Wunderlist app have been removed, or awkwardly placed/restricted. New features of the app are incredibly limited and feel poorly executed. Unfortunately there is nothing in this app that says ""I want this"", when migrating from Wunderlist, and makes other apps look more appealing. I hope further updates from Microsoft can deliver on user feedback.",0
"It is unfortunate that Microsoft decided to make this look like a Wunderlist copy. The old design simulated a lined notebook, and it was subtle, clean and minimalist. It looked like an extension of the physical world. This Wunderlist-inspired redesign is gaudy and artificial, introducing all sorts of unnecessary graphics and coloured lines. I never liked that Wunderlist made my tasks look like bricks, and I don't like this either.",0
"Moved to Microsoft To Do from Wunderlist. After a month of trying to adjust, I can't. It's terrible and has extremely limited functionality. It's essentially an app which let's you make a list. Moving back to Wunderlist which Microsoft owns bizarrely, it's much smarter and easier and has a ton of more functionality and looks better.",0
At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well. Or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves. The way it is now (chaotic) it is very user unfriendly and time consuming.,0
"This app is simply amazing as it comes from Microsoft and I'm quite a big fan of this app :) üòç All the features you wish for are all there in this app. But the major disappointment is that, the reminder feature doesn't seem to work. Due to this I miss most majority of my tasks, unless I keep on checking the list by opening the app frequently üòî Neither on my Windows 10 nor on my HONOR 8X (which are in sync mode). Please do fix this, then this will be an unbeatable app! Please update the app!ü•≥",0
"I really liked it when a list could have completed and uncompleted mixed alphabetically together. Now it is back like the much poorer Wunderlist method, with the two separated, uncompleted at top completed at bottom. Much harder to reuse lists. I have gone back to an earlier superior version. Sadly it won't sync with my wife's version of the app on iphone. Change it back!",0
"Latest update sucks. The quick select times are now useless. Go back to how it was, that actually worked.",0
"Recently, a lot of my appointments went missing. Or appointment only show up in laptop but not this app, despite the fact that both end are connected to the cloud and synchronized.",0
"One day, our tags will come......... We will be able to create lists from them. And all will be well.",0
It is good but for shortcuts on your screen it won't update,0
I love how this is but I had to switch back to default calender as this drains a lot of battery,0
"Could be good but, as usual with Microsoft, syncing is poor",0
"it is the very good app except it have only one level of sub-task, wish to have more. also, only one status (completed), missing other levels i.e started, in progress, delayed, completed with color code. Also, missing dashboard showing how many are of highest priority, started, in progress, delayed, completed etc. Sharing or colaboration is at task level only, sharing should also be at group level. Missing option to un-do the actions",0
"Although I love it's simplicity and minimalistic look some tasks set at dates are not notified. Update: have tried this app again and it seems recurring reminders fail...checking the list there is no 'alarm' symbol next to task as previously. Due to this, recurring reminders are not activated hence this app is useless when it comes to future reminders",0
Doesn't work on wifi properly,0
"For me an utterly useless app, which does nothing at all to help with my needs.",0
"Missing a lot of features the web version has such as categories, really lags behind other solutions",0
I stopped using this because of the reminders to enable notifications every time I open the app. My motivation is comically fragile and that reminder is enough to keep me from looking at my to-do list,0
"I keep turning off auto-suggestions. The app keeps turning suggestions back on. I hate this. If I turn an option off, leave it off.",0
There is somekind of bug in the selection on subtask text making it glitchy. Normal double tap a word to select it. Please option to disable swipe to delete subtasks. Plse can there be an opt to have simp fast note edit. The new changes cursor position and line spacing from a reading mode to editing and one looses focus on where to edit.,0
Needs a Microsoft account to function.,0
Pop up to turn on Notifications every time I open the app is very irritating.,0
"The app is overall great, although I preferred Wunderlist, especially when adding new tasks, the bar was on top and I much preferred that. But the worst part is that after the last update notifications don't work on my phone unless the app is on. I checked all settings and there is nothing I can change. This happened before with Wunderlist, I had to uninstall it. Shame.",0
"Works very poorly with mouse and keyboard input. When adding an item to a list, the suggestion strip only works well for touch input, but will work with mouse input IFF there are few enough suggestions that the horizontal scrollbar doesn't appear. Otherwise, the horizontal scrollbar hitbox is clearly overlapping the suggestions and has a higher z-order, making suggestions unclickable.",0
Too complicated to use,0
Sharing with other apps,0
Hopefully y'all clean the bugs ü™≤ No not the flying ones either Haha üòÜüòÖ,0
"Loved this till recent bugs. Now it keeps changing one recurring task to a different day. It sends me notifications to do tasks that are not on the day's list. It sends notifications to do tasks that are done! Starting to drive me crazy, looking for another app.",0
"Did not use sounds like a winner, but haven't learned the basics",0
Won't sync so pretty useless,0
Does not properly sync with Outlook,0
Missing location based reminder feature,0
"I don't know how this app has such a high rating. If we're speaking about services of MS more broadly, e.g. sync between the app and the desktop (DT) version of To-do, this is just a disaster. Tasks that I create on my mobile are not showing up in DT version, then when I click several times the 'Sync' button, it completely DELETES the task that I created on the mobile app instead of ADDING it to the DT version. The quality of MS products is falling down each year.",0
"It's good, but the WIDGET IS NOT UPDATING! Please fix this! I need to remove and then put it back again all the time! I'm giving a low rating so that they'll notice this.",0
"It is good for personal productivity. It doesn't give us history of the last activities (... of yesterday, last week, last month). If it will, it will help us to analyse and to do more better for the following days. Thanks.",0
"Can do better, just think about it, that's your job!",0
"I like the app a lot but the widget freezes sometimes (quite frequently, despite updates) which takes away a huge part of the usability of the app.",0
Won't load anything,0
The mobile app needs ability to specify and filter by category,0
Poor functionality and no response from developers,0
App is good but it takes very very long time to open.,0
"widget doest update, not seemlesly convinient for multi device.. plis fix it, since im corporate user of microsoft, it is important to us to be connected in multi device",0
"looks very basic, while other Microsoft platforms like edge look very smooth and sophisticated.",0
"This is the only Microsoft app that logs the user out every few weeks, requiring to login manually and approve with 2fa every time",0
You have to use an account to sign in to use. I pass.,0
"For the love of God, add a delete completed feature. How hard can this be?",0
"Please fix daylight savings, twice a year all my recurring tasks fall out of sync.",0
Nice app but reminders don't work. Defeats the purpose.,0
So sad that Wunderlist must gone. Will this one expect the expectation? My old tasks didn't show up in browser! Sync not reliable,0
It would be better if you have a look at Google Tasks,0
"Multiple reminders would be nice. For example, Samsung allows the user to be reminded of the event at several customizable intervals - one day before, one hour before as well as at the time of the event. All of these can be set together for any event.",0
"Was working fabulously on my Samsung A73 mobile until the last update a few weeks ago, half the time it is impossible to read the widget as it keeps saying ""loading""! Just removed the widget hoping it'll rectify itself if add it to the home pages again.",0
Headings somehow get cutoff. There is layout issue. Android 14 pixel 8 pro,0
"Awesome App, 1) if you could add undo feature : if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo.",0
No sound reminder,0
"No dark mode, really Microsoft!",0
"For some reason this app changes your reminder date, after it has passed. So if you have a reminder set to April 1st, for something due May 1st, it'll sort that Task below other April tasks. The next time it's at the top of your list will be it's due date. This wouldn't be terrible if you could see all deadlines as a priority. But you can't, so it a badly done app.",0
it isnt importing my calendar tasks from Google. I dont want 2 different lists.,0
It is fine. But it has no Repeat number Frequency option,0
"This is one of the most boring, average, to do lists in the world. From a company like Microsoft, it's frankly embarrassing. It has zero functionality and no selling points, though it does integrate with their products pretty well.",0
mediocre. not intuitive.,0
O.u ln tosg at q goaa is tx all fz SA aq as cb at a Za*¬£%awqw CX DD xs,0
"When I change thing, inside the app, it doesn't change in wedget!",0
Lots of features very large CPU usage.... Any interaction with the app seems to crash my phone. It seems like because it syncs with the other reminders app that I have on my phone that any interaction results in my phone crashing.... But has great features so if it works for you the options and functionality are top of the line.,0
"My to do list cannot be modified. This is a problem that I experience for months now. If I want to mark a task of my list as done, or make any change, I go from my reminders list. Last time I uninstalled the app and installed it again, set it up again and it worked for some days and then the same issue. I am thinking of uninstalling it again and use my reminders. In the past I would give 5 stars but now even 2 stars all too many.",0
"I have an Infinix Note 10 Pro. I like this app, but I don't get notifications for the reminders I set up. Update (27 Nov 2023) - still no reply from you guys.",0
"Okay okay. Recurring reminders do not work if previous reminder has not been ticked off as complete. For e.g., I have set up a reminder for every weekday. And now if I don't mark that task to be complete on Tuesday, reminder won't work for Wednesday and onwards unless I mark all pending reminders as complete.",0
Can't add lists under a group! Can't download photos from tasks. Where do they go? Need a page showing all tasks. Don't want to click around in a million lists. Need Eisenhower matrix labels.,0
Generally works okay but the timed notifications are not popping up on my latest version of Android (pixel 6a) have checked that all notifications are enabled,0
"Seems like basic features are very buggy and poorly thought out. For example, skipping to current task on a weekly task can put the due date more than a week into the future, with the notification date on a seemingly random nearby date that might even be after the due date. Also, after daylight savings ended the notifications were an hour off.",0
"App has always worked sporadically, often set reminders don't activate. Since last update will not work at all and am locked out of my task list with messages saying list no longer exists and owner has restricted access. I am the only owner/manager of task list & am signed in. I have paid microsoft subscription so very annoyed that paid for apps that have been set up to make sure critical things are done has failed like this, it is unrealistic to expect reentry/set up of all tasks/dates/reminder",0
"simple app, simple design",0
"Needs a rethink. The access through the web is instant. The app (on Chrome OS) is still spinning it's login wheels. For quick access, I'd recommend access via the internet as its quicker and helps productivity.",0
"I am quite disappointed that the sorting no longer applies to completed tasks. After years of missing this feature in Wunderlist, it was a very positive surprise seeing that it had been implemented in To-Do. Now it's gone again. If this change is not reverted, I will be dropping the app. It's a nice app but it doesn't serve me without that feature.",0
"This app was perfect until they decided to do one single ""you have things due today"" notification instead of individual notifications. I was able to leave notifications until of had a chance to complete the task. Now, I'm forced to open the app (which makes the notification go away) or use the widget (which takes up a lot of screen space). I'm so disappointed by this update.",0
"Microsoft bought the previous app I was using and the Microsoft experience has been ok. The biggest annoyance (and reason for the 2 star rating) is that the app keeps turning on the ""Plan Your Day Reminders"" notification regardless of how many times I turn it off. It's literally a useless notification that pops up saying ""What will you do today?"" and I don't want it to notify me.",0
"Since adding multiple account support I have been forced to log in repeatedly each day and resync the account. This is quite frustrating as a good bit of my day is away from cell or wifi coverage, which means I'm unable to access the app or add new tasks. This is quite frustrating and eliminates most of the benefit of the app. -- The app needs to be able to function offline with constantly needing to sync.",0
Wish they kept the wunderlist app instead it was perfect üò≠!!! Some issues I had with this app compared to Wunderlist to fix: -have new items added to the top instead of adding to the bottom (or have option to change) -more quick choice options for the reminder times -quick add bar (to just type in a search bar box instead of clicking the + button) -have settings apply to all lists so don't have to individually change each list -option to add to list on main screen without clicking in list,0
"Stay away. I loved Wunderlist. However, none of the changes the devs made moving from Wunderlist to ToDo enhanced the experience and they have broken countless other features. My most current gripe is that reminders don't consistently remind you on time. My recurring 9:00am alert finally kicked off at 3:59 today. My 7:00 nightly reminders only work about half the time. I'm defecting to something else as soon as i can find something suitable.",0
"It does what it says, but not easily or well. Its frustratin . I downloaded because they bought Wunderlist, and this is the replacement. It does not offer the same experience and is NOT a good replacement. From sorting, to reordering lists, to automatically seeing up tasks for the day, it misses the boat. And using the""suggest a feature"" button is a nightmare! You have to login for every new page, and the attitude is ""here's our way of doing it"" and no changes get made. I will be changing apps.",0
"This is a step down from Wunderlist. Before deprecating Wunderlist in favor of this app, it should atleast have been brought to parity. Sharing is broken, and even when it works, I have to send a link to the other person. It was so much simpler with Wunderlist! In the sharing with SMS option, the link and the text together require 2 texts. Why?!. Unhappy.",0
"dag, I JUST left a review expressing my love for the app less than 10 mins ago, only to have it start crashing on me moments later.. I thought it was a hiccup so to speak, but it crashed four more times, each time while trying to add a new task; I was editing the reminder date and time the last time but not sure about the first instances. I really liked the look/feel & ease of use but forced to give a poor rating because of it continuously failing during the usage of the most frequented portions",0
"1) No way to share a list within the app: you have to do it via email every single time. 2) When you join a list, it happens multiple times ""there's something wrong, please try again"". For one list I tried five times before I got it to work. If you have many shared lists from Wunderlist, good luck resharing them. Hey dumb Microsoft team, if you are not ready, don't discontinue Wunderlist.",0
"My wife and I used Wonderlist for years to share grocery lists, to-do's, packing lists, etc. The transition into Microsoft To Do could not have been more painful. Duplicate imports and no sharing between work/personal accounts made the move harder than it should be. But the most frustrating thing? I can no longer click and drag to order items in a list!! I be in the grocery store runnin around like a psycho cuz my list be all scrambled. And that's before I even look for toilet paper.",0
"Actually wasn't a terrible replacement for Wunderlist until the last update. The one feature I used all the time was the ability to show completed items with un-completed and sort the whole list and then hide completed items again, leaving everything sorted. Now you can no longer merge the lists and sort. Why take something out that was actually useful? Now this app is virtually useless for me.",0
"Why this constant pop up about Android settings? Once a day is much more than enough, don't you think? Why 100 times in a day? This popup treatment is bordering on adware. Wondering what your UX policies are. Another irritating feature. When i want to change reminder / due by date on a Sat, the only options are later today, Sunday. And the option for next week is present but disabled. So you want to decide by when a task should be done? It's not like you don't have space for option.",0
"Still use the app and rely on it. But still can't stand the my day. Need to be able to get rid of it or shut it off. No need to have it when you have today, tomorrow separated. Also, still have tasks that are postponed show up on dates postponed from. Really annoying. But still potential for a great app. Update 1/23. Still similar issues. Bugs are back with alarms showing up when not even due. Infuriating. The solution shouldn't be i hands to start over.",0
This app is inferior to Wunderlist as of now. It needs to be an option to duplicate a list exactly and rename it. You should also be able to attach pictures and instructions to long lists that you've made. It's just not nearly as intuitive as Wunderlist. I have 50 locations that often need all the same services performed and it is a major waste of time to type can01 can02 can03 can04 etc every time i have a sweeping maintenance issue.,0
"I give it an extra star for how it looks. For one time tasks it might be OK but for recurring, it just plain does not work. I set up two recurring daily tasks and I'd say it worked about 50% of the time. Luckily they were tasks that had some flexibility but after years of them NOT fixing this I give up. Simple Google Reminders just works. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles but it at least works. Sorry MS....you fail.",0
"I do NOT recommend this app. Pro: it makes list & integrated into your Microsift account but it's an Inferior app. I like being first adopters of things. I regretted moving/exporting from wunderlist & started using to-do exclusively. After a few months, I've decided to move all items back. It was NOT an easy feat as I had to manually review everything; it was worth it. I will not going to download this app until I'm forced to move from wunderlist and have to find a better product (like Tick Tick or any.do).",0
"Anyone have a better replacement for Wunderlist? I really am Just looking for list app and one where I can have shared lists. I don't need another half assed todo list. I have tried this in the past and it is not list app and it is not a functional task manage. I did go ahead a switch because the port was easy and I didn't want to loose my stuff, but I need a more functional replacement.",0
"I just want an app that duplicates what I see on my desktop. I cannot use features like to whom the task is assigned, start date, end date, progress, Etc. I do not like to so-called smart lists. I want to see the entire list of my items, and not have them broken down automatically into tasks or anything else. At least give me a manual option. I like to look through my entire list and set priorities, without having to go through multiple lists. Outlook needs a task function on its app. Not this",0
Very disappointed I have been working with this app for about a week to see if it would work as a replacement for Wunderlist. There are some good things. But the biggest problem I have with To Do is that I schedule My Day the night before so I can hit the ground running the next day. This doesn't work. The app forces me to reset everything in the morning. The app is supposed to help me get my work done. Instead it wastes my time redoing what was already done - planning My Day.,0
I am a user of the previous Wunderlist but Microsoft acquired the app so here I am. There's some differences which is fine but this app has a tendency of being horribly unreliable. I was hoping by now this would be more reliable but it isn't. Repeating reminders seem to work for a couple days and then it stops pushing reminders to my phone. It's very disappointing. I use this for grocery and other lists. I wish I could use the reminders too.,0
"I have used this app everyday for several months. It was working great, but a recent update (Dec '18?) removed the completion count, degraded the process of adding the previous day's items, and generally is no longer working as well. Now has more the feel of a student project than a professional tool.",0
"Everything is three colors: black, white, and bg color. Nothing feels separate or distinct, meaning I find it hard to visually separate individual tasks. To do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump. The star shouldn't be the same color as the background if it's supposed to stand out. Please make the star stand out more with a banner like Wunderlist and with a different color.",0
It's pretty good at what it does but it's not perfect . My biggest issue is that It doesn't really have a backup feature You can export your data to be imported into Excel or Outlook tasks but you can't just hit one button and save the entire thing as an editable easy to read format So I basically need to select each individual thing one by one and save it through the printing option which is extremely frustrating and time-consuming,0
Why did you mess with the way the lists print? My grocery list now won't print on 1 page !!!! I'm frustrated & angry at your change. I've used this app since I got my 1st smart phone & loved it. Went to print my list for this week & now the box is on a line above the list item. Now it takes 2 pages - not something my husband can manage! It wouldn't even download to my.othet apps- I had to download to Keep & then from there download again to Google Docs in order to find a way to print it. HATE!!!,0
Too hard to group stuff to Today or Tomorrow. Annoying notifications stating why aren't you doing more? Accusing clients of laziness. There are better task organizers out there. There are more critical things in life to do than a random list of house chores. The app is totally rude! It lacks dark mode. It hurts the eyes. It doesn't wipe out completed tasks. It doesn't graph completion. It doesn't have a habit tracker or calendar view. It doesn't have notes for tasks or logging.,0
"I like using this app to organize my to-do items for my company which subscribes to office 365. However, since the latest update my app constantly says ""unable to sync"" even though it appears to be working when I check in the browser on my desktop. Even uninstalling and reinstalling the app doesn't fix it. I can't trust the app with my vital work if I'm getting sync errors like this because I cannot lose anything. Please fix this and I will update to 4 or 5 stars.",0
"Thee planting reminders aren't working for me for some reason. I have them set and on, but I don't get notifications. Also, my trees don't wither when I go into an app that's not on my whitelist. They have an advanced detection mode, but sorry, I don't want Forest to be able to collect data on what I'm typing (it includes everything but passwords, even credit card numbers)",0
"I've set the app to not treat notifications as a disruption, and it still does. I respond to the warning that I need to ""return to Forest as soon as possible or the tree will wither,"" it looks like it's going fine, and suddenly a minute later I have a withered tree. A bit of a slap in the face to be going along for 55 minutes and have something wither on me in the last 5 minutes of a decent run. Where are the instructions on how exactly the notification disruption setting works? What's there right now is vague, unhelpful, and flat out doesn't work. It's a waste of money and a giant irritation if they can't get this to ignore certain apps properly. I'm ignoring my notifications to let the app continue running, and then I'm being punished. Very frustrating.",0
Worst log in system üòû,0
No full-screen notifications.,0
"Really disappointingly, the app slows my phone to the point where my phone is unusable. I actually really like the app but can't have it on my phone because of this",0
Modifies the system copy/paste menu,0
"I don't know how this app has such a high rating. If we're speaking about services of MS more broadly, e.g. sync between the app and the desktop (DT) version of To-do, this is just a disaster. Tasks that I create on my mobile are not showing up in DT version, then when I click several times the 'Sync' button, it completely DELETES the task that I created on the mobile app instead of ADDING it to the DT version. The quality of MS products is falling down each year.",0
"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice.",0
"Just not far enough along to be really useful. It did pull tasks from different accounts (personal, work, school) but there is no way to come up with a consolidated list to work from for the day. Subtasks (steps) don't have the ability to show up separately on a day so you can't use it to plan out complicated tasks. Tasks don't have a due time assignable so useless as a homework tracker. No geo-fencing. Ever since they gutted Outlook I been relying more and more on paper day-timer.",0
"It's confusing. to-do apps are supposed to make things easier but i find that this doesn't do that. it says it will remind but doesn't.. at least for me. it doesn't sync with cortana; she seems to have her own list. I think it syncs with Microsoft launcher? the ui/ux is confusing with the whole my day thing, and then there's planned, custom lists... there's no bi-weekly schedule. There should be ONE list tied to your account and all apps should sync with it.",0
"Love the concept, enjoy To Do on PC, love that it syncs immediately. What I do NOT love is that scheduled tasks do not sync with my Outlook calendar. This is very inconvenient as I have to have two programs open and if I want to schedule anything, I have to check my to do list. Also, noticed today that I can no longer check off tasks as completed in the app. When I do the task disappears for a second then pops right back onto my list as incomplete. Is currently useless.",0
"The new ""auto-complete suggestions enabled"" feature is loathsome. I have to turn off this nuisance in the list options for EACH list EVERY time I reopen the list. You should be able to turn it off in the app settings, and it should stay off when you turn it off. Worst, the list option to ""turn off auto suggestions"" is where a fat finger can do the most damage: right below ""delete list""! I accidentally deleted a list with dozens of repeating items.",0
"So I'll say this is a start. The pluses, the syncing between outlook tasks, todo web, and the UI is clean and generally nice to look at.  CONS:  Why is there no ""Planned"" list on the todo app. It's super annoying. There is no easy way to see my tasks for today and the upcoming week. ""Planned"" is implemented on web. The todo app really should have basic parity.  It's super painful in both the app and the web app to add dates. I add dates to every todo. It is very cumbersome compared to todoist.  I'm sure other people use it but I don't love the My Day feature. I don't like manually adding it. It should just show all the tasks due today. Maybe we could add that as a setting?  There is another bug. The date seems to be off. It works on mobile but it's off on the web app so it's not consistent. MS really needs to get their act together on this product.",0
"Interface similar to Wunderlist, functionally not the same unfortunately. As an example, Wunderlist allows manual sorting after sorting by one of the sort options (alphabetical, etc), which can fine tune things beautifully. Microsoft To Do does not allow manual sorting unless you deactivate the selected sort (like deactivating alphabetical sort as an example). This then reverts everything back to the same unsorted mess prior to the selected sort option. Very frustrating.",0
"I switched over to Microsoft to do after being notified that Wunderlist would not be available. With the most recent update to the app, the 'planned' list now only shows a filtered view. And I have to group it by date to even see it for each day. Previously I could see everything at once -by due date even overdue items. I can appreciate that everyone might not want to see everything. There should be an 'all' option if you are going to limit this. Looks like I get to find a new app.",0
"[Updated Review] This app is very great and I love many things about it, but the unforgivable missing feature is some sort of ""trash bin"". It's unbelievable that if I delete a list by mistake, it's completely gone forever! This missing feature makes To Do very unreliable. Even a temporal trash bin that self-cleans in intervals would be very useful. I also have MANY UX feedbacks, and I'm very willing to share over a session (not possible to cover by text review) .",0
I loved Wunderlist. To Do not so much. I cannot get my phone app or web app to sync. Very frustrating when you are sharing a list and cannot see what other people have added or completed. They in turn cannot see anything you have added or completed. My husband send I have the same exact phone and he has no problems with his app. I don't get it.,0
"I've used this app for quite some time with very few issues. When everything is working as it should be, it's a great app! However, since 02/06/2021 I've been unable to sync any of my shared lists. I cleared the app cache, signed out and back in again, and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Despite these attempts to rectify the problem, I still cannot sync shared lists.",0
"Bring back Wunderlist! This app has failed to link lists over and over. We find ourselves trying to relink lists, but it still doesn't work. Since this has changed from Wunderlist, it's a huge disappointment. Find a better app. Also, you can't silence it when someone is checking off a linked list (when it does work). Super annoying. I expected more from Microsoft.",0
"A new ""feature"" of Microsoft To Do compared to Wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day. This is incredibly annoying because if I don't have time to get to it, I want it to be a constant annoying reminder so I know to get around to it. I would rather continue to use Wunderlist, if the recurring tasks was implemented offline, instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task.",0
"This used to be a 5-star app. Loved it when it was ""Wonderlist"", and also when Microsoft first acquired it. This latest update has rendered it useless as a phone app, which is the whole point of using it... to keep lists and notes on the go. Now it only works on my laptop. On my phone, the cursor is all over the place, and the scroll bar moves up and down of its own volition.",0
"Pros: Free to use with no premium tier. You can set tasks, set them to repeat and get reminders. You can check them off when done. Cons: 1. Tasks that repeat every week are going to be listed under ""My Day"" with no indication whatsoever of whether this is this week's or next week's task. 2. Sub-tasks aren't visible in the main view. 3. Other minor inconveniences. I hate Todoist's premium tier, but sadly it's the better app.",0
"I have been using this app for a long time, even before Microsoft took over. One of the best to-do apps out there. It's great to be able to access the to-do list across multiple devices. Unfortunately since a recent update it is not possible anymore to edit more than one item on my tablet. After editing one item the app has to be restarted before another item can be edited, everytime. Re-installing the app doesn't solve the problem. I need the app to work across all my devices.",0
The app serves it's purpose but I came from wunderlist and I wish wunderlist would stay. Wunderlist is more aesthetically pleasing to the eye and makes it easier to remember to check. It's more satisfying to check it off your list and it feels less like actual work and more like play. Be more like wunderlist and you'll get more users,0
"What a terrible replacement for Wunderlist! My husband and I have been using Wunderlist for years to coordinate all types of lists around the house. With To Do, we haven't been able to find a way to share lists directly between the app on our phone. You have to go through a browser to join a list - FAIL.",0
"Seems like basic features are very buggy and poorly thought out. For example, skipping to current task on a weekly task can put the due date more than a week into the future, with the notification date on a seemingly random nearby date that might even be after the due date. Also, after daylight savings ended the notifications were an hour off.",0
"For some reason this app changes your reminder date, after it has passed. So if you have a reminder set to April 1st, for something due May 1st, it'll sort that Task below other April tasks. The next time it's at the top of your list will be it's due date. This wouldn't be terrible if you could see all deadlines as a priority. But you can't, so it a badly done app.",0
Lots of features very large CPU usage.... Any interaction with the app seems to crash my phone. It seems like because it syncs with the other reminders app that I have on my phone that any interaction results in my phone crashing.... But has great features so if it works for you the options and functionality are top of the line.,0
"App has always worked sporadically, often set reminders don't activate. Since last update will not work at all and am locked out of my task list with messages saying list no longer exists and owner has restricted access. I am the only owner/manager of task list & am signed in. I have paid microsoft subscription so very annoyed that paid for apps that have been set up to make sure critical things are done has failed like this, it is unrealistic to expect reentry/set up of all tasks/dates/reminder",0
"I keep turning off auto-suggestions. The app keeps turning suggestions back on. I hate this. If I turn an option off, leave it off.",0
"This is one of the most boring, average, to do lists in the world. From a company like Microsoft, it's frankly embarrassing. It has zero functionality and no selling points, though it does integrate with their products pretty well.",0
"Works very poorly with mouse and keyboard input. When adding an item to a list, the suggestion strip only works well for touch input, but will work with mouse input IFF there are few enough suggestions that the horizontal scrollbar doesn't appear. Otherwise, the horizontal scrollbar hitbox is clearly overlapping the suggestions and has a higher z-order, making suggestions unclickable.",0
"Okay okay. Recurring reminders do not work if previous reminder has not been ticked off as complete. For e.g., I have set up a reminder for every weekday. And now if I don't mark that task to be complete on Tuesday, reminder won't work for Wednesday and onwards unless I mark all pending reminders as complete.",0
"Missing a lot of features the web version has such as categories, really lags behind other solutions",0
"Was working fabulously on my Samsung A73 mobile until the last update a few weeks ago, half the time it is impossible to read the widget as it keeps saying ""loading""! Just removed the widget hoping it'll rectify itself if add it to the home pages again.",0
Pop up to turn on Notifications every time I open the app is very irritating.,0
"When it is skipped to the current tasks, it will skip to the next week, even though the due dates have been customised to days within the week that haven't arrived yet.",0
"Awesome App, 1) if you could add undo feature : if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo.",0
"A fantastic and helpful app became useless with the last update. Grouping open and completed tasks may be helpful for some, but for some types of lists it would be really handy to have all tasks together. For example a picking list (or shopping list) with the items sorted in order of their position in the warehouse. You do not need everything every time, so you can just uncheck the items when needed during a round, possibly hiding the completed tasks to minimize screen cluttering. This was possible before, but with the recent update(s) all completed tasks have moved to a separate list. All custom sorting is lost. Dear Microsoft, please re enable these features. You could provide an option in settings to use one or the other. (Maybe even on a list level) 2 stars because it used to be a good app, otherwise I would have now given it only 1 star.",0
"Totally agree with the below reviews. This was a perfectly serviceable Todo app, which I enjoyed that synced with Alexa, until it started giving me daily ""Plan your day"" notifications. There's a toggle for these in the settings, but it turns itself back on the next day! Rubbish, Microsoft! Needs to be fixed - but I'm going back to Todoist.",0
"Notification improvements would make all the difference. This app is sleek & has a simple, would be helpful layout. Unfortunately, the notifiction function is useless. The notice disappears quickly (there should be an option for it to stay until ticked). So if you walk away from your phone you may miss an important reminder! I really wanted to like this app, not least b/c i syncs flagged emails in outlook but what good is a to do app which is outperformed by pen and paper?",0
"When you create a task and then set a reminder, you have to go back to the text and press enter otherwise it doesn't save it, or even warn you if you navigate away. Caught me out a few times, seriously annoying so looking at other options. Other than that it's ok but nothing special and the views are a bit odd. All for example doesnt actually show all tasks!",0
"Trialling this as they ditched the wonderful Wunderlist. Main problem so far is that there is no option to autoshift completed tasks to the bottom of the list. Hidden or taking up space at the top is not user friendly. Visually - no point in having a lovely background if the tasks block it with solid white. Wunderlist looked SO much better, friendlier and more appealing with translucent backgrounds to tasks. These are the kind of style and practical tweaks that should be obvious, right?",0
"Could be great... But no. I really want to love it. It integrated with my other work apps and is (technically) cross platform. But it's extremely inconsistent. I can have tags in outlook and the browser, but not on mobile. You can't sort by tag in browser but you can on outlook. Subtasks do not exist in outlook, but task status ONLY exists in outlook. It's a complete mess and I need multiple apps open to get all the relevant information I need.",0
"It's good that you can import from wunderlist, but the planner is missing some really basic features. For instance it's impossible to set a repeating reminder, which makes it pretty useless... And why 'My Day' doesn't automatically populate with the things you have set for the day is beyond me. Poorly thought out, as I am finding a lot of Microsoft products are these days. I'm looking for a better app.",0
"Being able to slide tasks up and down on the fly is a critical feature which needs to be brought over from Wunderlist. I plan and order my work day tasks with it and need to be able to adjust the order quickly and frequently. My wife and I also were using Wunderlist as a grocery list sharing tool. Same complaint as we like to order the list to match our path through the grocery store. I see a few people miss this option in the reviews - Without it, the app doesn't work for me.",0
"My to do list cannot be modified. This is a problem that I experience for months now. If I want to mark a task of my list as done, or make any change, I go from my reminders list. Last time I uninstalled the app and installed it again, set it up again and it worked for some days and then the same issue. I am thinking of uninstalling it again and use my reminders. In the past I would give 5 stars but now even 2 stars all too many.",0
"Switching from Wunderlist. Can't even get started because I end up in an endless loop of ""not a recognized Microsoft accout"" so i click on create new account, use the same email and get ""there is already a Microsoft account with this email."" Just trying to not loose my lists when Wunderlist shuts down. Extremely frustrating.",0
"""you can't get reminder if notification off"" ... I know what I'm doing, it's extremely inconvenient to show a pop-up warning everytime the app is opened!",0
"Recently, a lot of my appointments went missing. Or appointment only show up in laptop but not this app, despite the fact that both end are connected to the cloud and synchronized.",0
"This used to be an awesome simple app, especially before Microsoft took it over. I'm using a Google Pixel 6 and the widget does not work in many of the sizes and even when you get it to work, the next day it may show nothing on your list. When it does this you can't even click on the widget to get in to the app. I have the latest firmware and software updates as of 03 /23/22",0
"This does not work the same as wunderlist. When I sort, I cannot manually move items to in effect do a sort alphabetically within priority. Also when I prioritize items, they don't automatically move to the top of the list. With wunderlist going away, I am going to have to search for a new app. So disappointed.",0
"Worked perfectly on my Pixel 4XL, when I upgraded to the Pixel 6 Pro, the widget often does not work. It's on the 2nd page of my phone, when I swipe there, I'll see my task list for a split second, then it goes to ""My Day"" list (empty), and I'm unable to access the drop down menu to select a different list. If I resize the widget it starts working again.",0
"Super annoying that you can't find your expired, but incomplete tasks, or you have to dig through the screens to find them. Super annoying that the tasks are added in reverse order, i.e. the last two shows up first on the list and you have to constantly rearrange the list.",0
"Good task app but buggy widget. App is good for scheduling tasks and reminders, but need more customization. Widget is buggy and sometimes just display black out with nothing on it, it happens a lot more often lately. It needs a phone restart to fix, and I'm not going to restart a few times a day just to""fix"" this one buggy app.",0
"Decreased rating to 2 stars because a recent change now causes an alphabetized list to become out of order when ""Move starred tasks to top"" is used. It used to be that when I starred an item then unstarred it, the item went back to its previous position in the list. Now it stays at the top of the list, and I have to manually move it back. My grocery list is now almost unusable. If this is not fixed soon, I will find another app that does what I want.",0
"This app changed recently in an annoying way. Now, completed tasks are no longer sorted or even sort-able. We use this app for shopping lists and have previously appreciated the ability to sort a list we use repeatedly in alphabetical order. Now it's impossible to sort the completed taske for reuse. That's just lame.",0
"The overall function is good. problems are, not all repeat options are compatible so therefore you can't use them. Also I was surprised there is not a way to search my tasks. also the widget doesn't color code anything so I have no idea what is before or after the due date I have set. I would expect better from Microsoft.",0
"We started using this app when Wunderlist was no longer available. It worked well for so long. A couple of months ago it stopped syncing across the four androids in our household, which is terrible when you're grocery shopping and things are either not on the list or are still on the list from the last store visit. We all reinstalled the app, but that didn't help. We've now downloaded the Anylist app, but NONE of the apps are better than Wunderlist.",0
The my day widget does not update and after leaving the home screen stops showing to do lists. It has to be removed and re added which is a temporary and annoying fix to what's probably a simple problem in the code. This widget has NEVER worked right. Does Microsoft even fix bugs like this? At least once every 3 years or so (as long as this issue has been happening)?,0
"I love the concept of this app, with sharing capability, but when I have to turn off auto-suggestion literally every time I open the app, I want to throw my phone across the room... Seriously how hard is it to respect my wishes with settings. Incredibly frustrating. Would be an easy 5-star otherwise.",0
I come from Wunderlist and I so miss the usability and simplicity of Wunderlist. This app somehow has very cluttered and hard too use UI. Disappointed that Microsoft cannibalised Wunderlist to push their so inferior product. The only reason stopping me from finding something else is the inability to migrate my task data out of this app to another todo list app.,0
"Decent app, it was better as Wunderlist. Giving it 2 stars because the auto suggestion feature continues to turn itself back on every time you open the app. I don't want the feature and it should be a toggle in the settings app to turn off not on individual lists! Apps should defy users settings!",0
"it is the very good app except it have only one level of sub-task, wish to have more. also, only one status (completed), missing other levels i.e started, in progress, delayed, completed with color code. Also, missing dashboard showing how many are of highest priority, started, in progress, delayed, completed etc. Sharing or colaboration is at task level only, sharing should also be at group level. Missing option to un-do the actions",0
"Although I love it's simplicity and minimalistic look some tasks set at dates are not notified. Update: have tried this app again and it seems recurring reminders fail...checking the list there is no 'alarm' symbol next to task as previously. Due to this, recurring reminders are not activated hence this app is useless when it comes to future reminders",0
The widget is not syncing properly across devices. I have one device saying that an event due today is not due until tomorrow. Another device correctly says due today. Hitting the refresh icon does not clear the problem. Opening the actual app shows correct details. Widgets across the entire Outlook suite are unreliable.,0
I really like the app itself but ever since I got a new phone it prompts me to turn on notifications every time I open it. I don't want notifications. I turned them off for a reason. The prompt is annoying enough that I'm gonna find another to do list app.,0
I really enjoyed this app and used it daily. I would have given it a higher rating but it seems they removed the ability to add a home screen shortcut to individual lists. It has decreased its usefulness.,0
There is somekind of bug in the selection on subtask text making it glitchy. Normal double tap a word to select it. Please option to disable swipe to delete subtasks. Plse can there be an opt to have simp fast note edit. The new changes cursor position and line spacing from a reading mode to editing and one looses focus on where to edit.,0
"When all one wants is a daily checklist, it's irritating to go into each task and skip to current task. If a task repeats why would I want it to stay forever under the completed. It becomes too much of a hassle to keep clearing the completed ones.",0
"this app often missed to show notification. at first i thought probably android kill the app in background to save battery, so i often open the app many times within day. even then, still in many occasion the notification fails to show. please fix it.",0
I stopped using this because of the reminders to enable notifications every time I open the app. My motivation is comically fragile and that reminder is enough to keep me from looking at my to-do list,0
"After the update, there is no sound on completion. I have tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the app, clearing app data, checking every setting and permissions very thoroughly, but to no avail. It's very annoying to constantly check the app to see when the tree is done growing or when my break is done as I do not get notified at all. Please fix!",0
Does not have the same functionality options as the outlook tasks. It is just an effort to repair something that is not broken rather than adding more functionality options to the tasks.,0
It's pretty good at what it does but it's not perfect . My biggest issue is that It doesn't really have a backup feature You can export your data to be imported into Excel or Outlook tasks but you can't just hit one button and save the entire thing as an editable easy to read format So I basically need to select each individual thing one by one and save it through the printing option which is extremely frustrating and time-consuming,0
Liked the app. The commercial that appeared evertime I closed any other app on my phone was annoying. Deleted your app and the commercials stopped.,0
"Tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work, if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks. If you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it, it will never work again.",0
"To Do list apps, like this one, are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks. Too bad because the interface is otherwise well done.",0
Had high hopes for this because it had everything I wanted but the completed tasks that I keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating. Have tried all the settings to get of it but I can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore,0
It was doing what it is supposed to do at first but after some time it's glitching and it is becoming worst. Reccuring tasks is unreliable.,0
Not able to install on more than two devices. I found this frustrating as I had one phone stolen and another broke. Now I can‚Äôt download on my new phone because it‚Äôs already on the other with my main email. Does not allow another email. Not too pleased about this.,0
"Only subscription-based if you want to pay, doesn't allow lists at the top. There aren't options that I see from less expensive options.",0
"app maybe okay, but its very confusing to understand. I have tried about 30 min to set a simple task for a particular date, but it doesnt show up anywhere. So, i will keep looking for a more simplyfied app. Sorry.",0
The 1st action the app wants is to name a list. What am I listing and why would I name it? What I'm looking for is a reminder with an alarm using the ringtones already on my phone to remind me of important events. This app doesnt seem to function that way. I dont know what I'd use this app for.,0
PLEASE make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select. this would be VERY convenient. thank you.,0
It failed to notify me for the first time. I set up recurring monthly notifications for my bills and it was working perfectly. I'm two days late for a bill payment now.üò£,0
"alarm that's supposed to go off at 11am,goes off 40 to 60 minutes later, for no discernable reasons. also, make picking time a 24 hours scheme. it seems to always assume i want to be reminded of something at 11 pm",0
"YOUR CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING YOR CASE. There is a sublist reorder but NOTHING for the MAIN LIST. THERE IS NO SORT OF ANY KIND says sort by DO DATE or lets you PICK WHAT TO SORT BY, A LOGIC CHOICE. Completed tasks NEED TO CHANGE IMIEDIATELY so you KNOW IT'S COMPLETED & next month IS SET. I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T SIMPLE. The INTERFACE is NOT VERY INTUITIVE. I DID LOOK AT HELP & THERE is LITTLE FOR THE MAIN LIST. YOU ARE very IRRITATING so I am going to try other choices.",0
"Bad experience as the events created (Ex: Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc.) in Alarm mode is working only sometimes!! In such situations, the event is just turning ""Red"" (but Alarm is not ringing) as if i missed the event...!!",0
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.,0
"Not competent at scheduling. Recurring tasks are automatically ""completed"" if not checked by the scheduled time. There is no way to know if you missed it. The interface is pleasant though.",0
"Got everything set up with all permissions granted and unlike all my other similar apps, and after many tries, this app just doesn't work! I know how to set these apps up to work, at least I thought I did but... this app just will not work on my flagship Samsung phone. I'd give 5 stars for this to work!",0
"Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling",0
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue,0
I got a new phone and I backed up all my data from the application. When I came to restore the data it's says that only in premium version its possible. That wasn't mention when I did a backup file. So all important data is gone...,0
"There is no way to create repeated scheduled tasks. I already have Google calendar for what this does. Its nicer looking but I don't need what I already have. EDIT. in response: no it's not easy. And honestly, the app has so many more issues. Deleting things is difficult, but making mistakes in organization is easy. Organization is not great on this app. I don't like your app guys. I dont know who it's good for, but its not me. But I appreciate the slight on my post.",0
It is a great tasks app I have ever seen but it was super duper expensive for me like I'm just a student. I just want to share my file to my mothers phone so that it can be secure even my phone will die. I hope you can do something about it.,0
"Nice app with a lot of feature but I found a bug. If you use the repeat task, evertime the task repeat, the complete mark on sub-task suppose to be in not done yet state but the system doesn't do that. The tasks is repeated with completed state sub-task.",0
"it was pretty good on my old phone. then when everything was ported to my new one, the app came, but not the lists I'd made. what's the point of that?! I've deleted it.",0
"It would be great if it defaulted to a home screen with all the lists. I cannot find my other lists. Where the hell is what should be obvious, ""your lists""",0
"Confusing!!, i want to like this app, but as an aspie, im finding it confusing to navigate, considering deleting üò•",0
"It's just okay, it's too easy to delete tasks on accident and it puts it in backwards",0
"Would like to assign priority rating to each task (A=do it soon, B=do it later, C=low priority, Z=take it off the list)",0
"Thanks, but it now has gone wrong being unable to alert and no alarm at all. Please advise if this app is still ok to keep!!!?",0
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me.",0
Not very user friendly. So many steps to make a reminder that you will have forgotten what you wanted to remind yourself to do.,0
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all,0
"I love nearly everything about this app, but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background.",0
"Thank u, but what I actually want to know is what settings I must use to let the app pop up on the screen even if the screen is locked. Thanks.",0
"I really want to love this app but it won't even let me select PM so its constantly telling me its past the due date, which makes the app very useless to me.",0
"Needs to be more user friendly , looked for a set reminder but could not find one , too many options for me .",0
can't back up and restore your lists unless you pay them so all my lists are gone. can't put a necessary feature like that behind a paywall.,0
Almost what I needed... no way that I could find to repeat tasks for future days without inputting them all individually for each day... thats a deal breaker,0
"What an unprofessional reply. Mate I don't want your app nor services for free, but don't pretend that it is a ""lovely community supported project with all local features for free"" and then put an effing paywall when I'm doing my backups before wiping my phone. Ridiculing me for not giving you $2 is a nice way of hiding when someone calls you out. I'm glad you removed that paywall now but during the time I used this app it was there so here's my review",0
While swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted. At least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete.,0
Terrible. I've missed so many reminders despite adding it to unmonitored apps and not being on power saver. I give up.,0
"Paid for premium. Settings had reflected that I am using paid version up until the most recent update. Now it says ""Upgrade to Premium"". What is going on?",0
"After setting the reminder and adding alarm sound in it I am only able to feel the vibration, sound is completely missing...",0
"Almost what i need, except there's no option to set a start & end time with reminder for the start. So it's useless (for me).",0
It‚Äôs not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. üò≠üò≠,0
"Unhelpful cryptic instructions, Premium beta painfully slow. Can't waste time fathoming sublists and other features, though the app looks promising.",0
"I'm using this app, but when I repeat the schedule weekly, it shows no repetition. So this means I need to make a schedule weekly? Ineffective. Please fix this. :(",0
The app no longer reminds me of tasks and keeps bringing up ones marked complete.,0
i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there. you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen. deleting this app for this reason. too bad... the rest is great. but they need a home screen. they don't have one.,0
"I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying.",0
"Great app.. and as of now my main reminder app. But few areas for usability improvement. The most prominent. 1) Reminder calendar is fixed to start from Sunday as 1st day of week - very uncomfortable as Monday is our 1st day- system locale is right, other apps are fine! 2) more pronounced or large area to tap for reminder day/time - often I tap a bit above and this turns off the reminder function. 3) Very hard to apply swipe gesture to delete a task, I had to try dozen times until it reacts!",0
"simple app, widget is bad (left side has a bar that ruins symmetry, also you cant remove the new task button), also, why can I change list color but cant change button color? would also be cool to preview what ""compact/cozy"" and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one, leave settings, and go back in to change them again. all in all, its almost a 5 star app, but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit.",0
"The backup feature does not work. I am stuck having to copy over 1000 items in my lists manually. I understand syncing is a premium feature, but the backup feature is not and I wish I hadn't bothered with this app in the first place. Edit: In response to your comment, my problem isn't the fact that I want premium features for free, it is the fact that I downloaded this app knowing that it had a free backup feature built-in, which is the main reason I chose this app. Your response shows a lack of professionalism, and frankly, maturity. The premium features do not include a back-up feature, but rather a syncing feature, which doesn't suit my needs. Your app is not the value of a free coffee. The premium features cost $20.99 for a subscription, not a one-time fee. The app accepts donations, but it's also for profit. The description of the app and it's features are misleading, and this is why I am giving you a negative review.",0

As a matter of fact when checking the completed task, there will be two completed tasks, the current one just completed and the next one due. I'm going to have to find something else.",0
"It is not very flexible. It's a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them. I wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar.

You and everyone else all look at this and instantly see that some features and functions are free and others are paid. By itself that's fine. But do not say that all features are fully free and then also say that if you want to use these features you have to pay. If it doesn't matter that it's lying, maybe it matters that it's bad for business.",0

See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either.",0

There's another move which tries to move the task to the same list if you have only one list. What is needed is a simple drag and drop of a task to a different order. The 2nd option is to have only 'Move' upon touch and hold, and then pop up a sub menu. This sub menu can have up / down arrow and other move choices.",0
"It's excellent if you don't make the mistake of using the sub-tasks feature. Sub-tasks are broken.

"I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat ""monthly"". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly.",0
"Stopped using. Just doesn't operate the way I'd like. This is a very good app, and I love the non-subscription purchase, but tapping on a task in ""Daily"" takes you to that tasks list. (For example ""Run 2miles"" takes you to ""Health,"" a task list I set up for workouts, and not ""Daily,"" the default daily task list.) This is not intuitive and makes it difficult to use. Reminders ONLY fire when I reboot my phone, defeating the entire purpose. It's just not doing what I want it to do.",0
"Update: messed up with all tasks as it is not ringing on time. Weird and no more helping me. Uninstalled. This app is really good. No ads popping in between.

It‚Äôs a pity as other than this, it is a nice app.",0
"On the search for a to-do list app that lets me set up daily repeating tasks and resets their status at midnight so I can check them off the next day. To do this you have to first set a due date and then the repeating option shows up. But if you make the due date ""all day"" then the repeating option disappears, but it's still active? When I complete the task the widget auto creates a task copy of the first one and that one is also marked complete? Also the dev keeps deleting his replies",0

If only you can fix that and made the deleting parts optional it would be soo much better.",0
Doesn't have a repeat option for taskes you want to repeat.,0
I was just looking for a simple list. At least no login required.,0
"I have tasks for which I have specified a repeat option (e.g. daily or weekly).  Sometimes these work, but sometimes I don‚Äôt get notifications for the repeats. When I look at the problem tasks in the app, the due date is shown in red and is prior to the current date.  It‚Äôs as if the app ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to update the due date. It‚Äôs a pity as other than this, it is a nice app.",0
"Nice app with a lot of feature but I found a bug. If you use the repeat task, evertime the task repeat, the complete mark on sub-task suppose to be in not done yet state but the system doesn't do that. The tasks is repeated with completed state sub-task.",0
"It would be great if it defaulted to a home screen with all the lists. I cannot find my other lists. Where the hell is what should be obvious, ""your lists""",0
Lacking,0
"Nothing special. Hate how the notification staya on my lock screen. If i want to put in a task, then I'll know where to go. Also, i keep seeing tasks that I've already completed reappear as if they were never checked off. Little annoyances like that lead to bigger issues. Uninstalling today and looking for a better one.",0
Could write just a simple list,0
Only let me create one list.,0
"Too complicated and not intuitive. I would make a list only to find out it was a sublist. Can't delete a list. I uninstalled the app today. I used to use the one with yellow ""stickies."" Easier for lists. I wasn't trying to use it to be a task or project manager.",0
"Meh want a simpler app, this too fiddly",0
"Stopped using. Just doesn't operate the way I'd like. This is a very good app, and I love the non-subscription purchase, but tapping on a task in ""Daily"" takes you to that tasks list. (For example ""Run 2miles"" takes you to ""Health,"" a task list I set up for workouts, and not ""Daily,"" the default daily task list.) This is not intuitive and makes it difficult to use. Reminders ONLY fire when I reboot my phone, defeating the entire purpose. It's just not doing what I want it to do.",0
"Only subscription-based if you want to pay, doesn't allow lists at the top. There aren't options that I see from less expensive options.",0
Cumbersome and awkward. Good potential but not intuitive.,0
"On the search for a to-do list app that lets me set up daily repeating tasks and resets their status at midnight so I can check them off the next day. To do this you have to first set a due date and then the repeating option shows up. But if you make the due date ""all day"" then the repeating option disappears, but it's still active? When I complete the task the widget auto creates a task copy of the first one and that one is also marked complete? Also the dev keeps deleting his replies",0
"Looks like a good app, and I understand the need to fund it with premium. I really don't appreciate the dishonest marketing of premium, however. You and everyone else all look at this and instantly see that some features and functions are free and others are paid. By itself that's fine. But do not say that all features are fully free and then also say that if you want to use these features you have to pay. If it doesn't matter that it's lying, maybe it matters that it's bad for business.",0
This app doesn't have clear instructions for bulleting each task & marking tasks completed one-by-one.,0
"Been using for a while. However, accidentally uninstalled this app and now I find I cannot restore unless I donate. Wow just hit one button and gone. Today is not the day for. Goodbye. After developer's response... You really jump to the conclusion that my review was because I want your program for free? I'm saying require the donation when I tried to use the backup feature instead of when I ran into trouble and tried the restore. At this point it feels like I'm being ...... Not so Brilliant.",0
Can't figure it out! I add a task and then it goes away and I never see it again. I honestly have had it for so long and finally tried to really look at it and I wanted to get to the main menu. Or something/somewhere to see my current and previous tasks but no matter what I press nothing took me there. It just created a task and disappeared so I finally deleted it. Would love to figure it out seeing as it has such high ratings but it shouldn't be this hard and I have a bachelor's degree lol,0
"I have been a regular user of the free version for a while and was constantly telling people about this great app. However, most of my previously unlocked trees disappeared after the most recent update and it appears this was intentional on the part of the developers. While I understand that this app is part of a business, it is very disappointing to have features stripped in this way and it does not motivate me to move to the pro version, it just burns the goodwill I had toward this company.",0
"I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have ""pro version"" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",0
"Lately I'm into planting with my friends but often times the duration that I set is not properly synced on my friend's phone. Previously the duration on my friend's phone will eventually catch up when I start planting, but lately it doesn't (for example, my remaining time would be 59:01 and my friend's would be 29:01). Please fix this bug, it's been going on since a month ago ü•≤",0
"It does not interfere when i leave the app, even in pro version. Edit: If i leave immediately after planting a tree, it interferes. But if, for example, i have planted a 60 min tree and i come after 40 min and leave the app, it does not interferes and completes the tree as if i never left. Moreover, even after changing all the settings, it notifies me of tree completion only when i open my phone and not on it's own, because of which i have to put a timer along with tree whenever i have to use it",0
"In my opinion, a free version of an app should be as good as the paid one, though without extra features and with advertisements. The free forest app used to be good, but since the whitelist has been disabled, it has become useless. Example: apps that I need kill the tree, even turning off an alarm withers it!",0
"My favourite species were taken away and made available only for pro. I used different species (especially my favourite ginkgo and blossom tree) for certain activities and I could see in my forest how I was managing my activities. The change made me very upset, because it's not a right thing to do, to take away something that was earlier available for everyone. Perhaps it was done to encourage to buy the pro version, but it made me feel that you can't take for granted what you buy in this app.",0
"Was a good app, but unfortunately they chipped away at the free version until it became pretty useless. First, limited the unlockable tree species, then removed access to previously unlocked ""premium"" trees (giving an unusable refund because so few non-premium trees are left), then, most annoyingly, inserted a pop up that tells you all of this every time you click anything at all. Wouldnt have bothered with the review, except for the pop up, which is more annoying than any ad.",0
"Nothing advertised is actually available in the free edition, it's being promoted as a free editor's choice app for productivity but all it does is only limit almost all the features that would make sense to make it a useful app to its premium version... Not very impressed... Couldn't even view my usage stats there are a bunch of free apps that do much better than this in all means...",0
For some weird reason the app (timer) stopped working after a few months of installing the app. I used to use it everyday but now all I can do is uninstall it. it's kinda weird how this is an editors choice app. I would give this a five star if this was fixed. and it would be much better if this was not a timer. I would much more prefer if you can add a start button and when you finished studying you can just stop it instead. you can't really estimate the time it takes for you to study.,0
"For the first week of using it, everything was okay but suddenly all of my progress were gone. It was frustrating. And when I tried to use it again, the plant does not change with time. For example, when I adjusted the time to 1 hr, the plant is still a bush. I tried the max time but the plant is still a bush. So I uninstalled it. But it is still a good app.",0
"i used to love this app! studying was a lot easier with the coin system, trading the ones you get for beautiful trees was more than enough to motivate me. however, these so called ""bug fixes"" have made those different tree options unavailable for non premium users. now, you're left with a very small amount of really simple and bland species.... such a shame.",0
"In all honesty, I really love the forest app. Have been using it for almost 2 years now and it has been with me for the struggles I have faced in my academic life. BUT, about some weeks ago, the app just won't open and kept on crashing. It eventually updated and when I was about to use it, all of the trees I bought were gone, and more devastatingly, my forests from 2018 & 2019 have been comoletely wiped out. I love the app but please work harder in making the system and processes better.",0
"Used to enjoy this app a lot, but now the free version only allows for 2 focus sessions a day.üòï It didn't used to be the case. Disappointed at the change. As a student, upgrading to the paid-for premium version is not really a viable option. Will have to just set my own timer or look for another more accessible app to replace this one. Sad. ü•Ä",0
"The app itself is great, but the main feature I need does not work: notification when the focus time ends. The whole point of using an app like this is so you don't constantly look at your phone or the clock to see how much time is left. It's a pity, and because of that, I won't be using it anymore. (I had the pro version)",0
"I like the concept however the app has some significant problems on my phone model. Sometimes just turning on the screen, without even unlocking the phone, causes the tree to whither because of ""system UI"", which is really annoying after working for 40 minutes. I've tried turning on advanced detection and notification detection which has had no help. I have a LG K8 4G running android 6.0",0
"Great app and concept... But please in the next update please add an option to PAUSE the timer. Also make it an option in settings, not in deep focus mode. Because there are some thoughts that need to be addressed for a few minutes and if not addressed can ruin all the session. It can also help in plant together because I have seen many people that gets an urgency but don't want to give up which breaks the loyality and ultimately breaks the purpose of planting together.",0
This app has big issues. It allows other apps to be used even though they have been restricted from use during a tree planting. This is despite blocking those apps in the allow list It kept crushing so I uninstalled it and put it back on. All my progress from when I started planting trees was lost and I use a pro version. One should be able to recover those planted trees surely. After all I'm using the pro version .,0
"I really like the idea of trees representing your focus hours. I even purchased the app so I can buy more tree species. But the app is so laggy. I have to press several time to change tags or tree types for example. The notification only works sometimes. And whenever I open the app, it's reloading instead of showing where I was last time. Sometimes my tree withers for no reasons. I really like the app so I hope future versions of the app will get better.",0
"I really loved the concept! Unfortunately, this app is not able to block most app that matters and actually kill focus (i.e. Facebook, Instagram). I am aware that the advanced detection option might have solved my issue but the only way I could activate it on my Samsung Galaxy was by compromising my phone's security by disabling secure startup, which is obviously not an option. Unless this issue gets resolved, this app is completely useless to me.",0
"There's a lot to like about this app, and I tried it for a long time. Unfortunately, just one bug kills it: the sound notification in the end of the timer is very unreliable if the phone screen turns off. So you have to have another timer to restart this timer! Yes, even with this app in the foreground. Yes, with all permissions and notifications on, battery optimization off, etc.",0
"It's a good app for concentrating, but they should add a feature to add people with something that isn't an email adress, like most apps.... Also, with the allow list I have an issue. Even though I have all the system apps allowed, when I edit photos on my Xiaomi 11T while in deep focus mode, a message appears saying I am using ""com.miui.mediaeditor"" and won't let me edit photos. I hope they fix this bug.",0
"Nice idea. But first time using it there was a message about missing permissions so you could minimise and do something different and your tree would continue growing. Not sure what permissions it would need. After switching to another app, a notification was triggered to my connected watch every second. Very annoying. I'm sure I could sort these issues by searching for the app permissions and stopping the app from alerting my watch. But its all just hassle. Easier to uninstall. I also wonder what the notification every second was doing to my phone battery. Sorry. I tried.",0
"This app used to be brilliant, I mean I love the new updates and all but the whitelist feature was the best part of the app. It meant that when you were working you could listen to music, something which is scientifically proven to help concentration, and answer any unavoidable calls or emails. Now you have to pay for that feature, which means that some can't use the service because of that. In all honesty it's a shame I get that the developers need to profit but was it not enough beforehand when the payed extras weren't necessary to the app itself?",0
"The app keeps closing. I bought the pro version and after 2 days the app stopped. Please look into the issue. Its really a great app to focus and it has helped me as well, but frequently closing makes it really tough for me. I have to uninstall it and re-install it again. ***Edit- I have sent a mail to u guys regarding the problem please look into the issue and resolve. It's an humble request",0
"The app is very useful but important parts that adds fun are really annoying: 1. I can't zoom or rotate my forest. Can't change place of trees. I would like to customize my forest. Trees appear randomly and after using for a month, there are many trees and the forest is so small that trees barely distinguishable. 2. Progress is slow: you have to do at least 30 180 minutes session in order to open 1 2k tree. 3. Some menu items are confusing: ex, allow list for deep mode, global ranking",0
It's a good app but it cares too much for the payment while there are a lot of students.. it keep adding a lot for only payment.. hope you will solve it,0
"When switching to a new phone there is no automatic syncing of your records, tags, etc. Using the export data doesn't yield any results as on my old phone as I only get a loading circle but nothing happens. If I touch the screen during this process the whole process is terminated. After waiting endlessly you get prompted with what I believe is a share screen. At this point one must be careful because if you make a mistake and touch something outside of the share screen, restart the whole proces",0

"Bought the Premiem. After 6-7 months of logging in data , gets really slow. After a year, it took almost 5 mins to view my total time for a given period. Otherwise also response time for a small event like clicking a button is too long . Aesthetically also very basic. Idea is good but app functionality and design is very bad",0
I really love (loved - hope to love again) this app but recently the sounds that you can play while on the timer have been skipping and crackling- its very distracting and I use them a lot. I uninstalled and reinstalled but in the process all I did was lose the sound I had purchased (cafe in Paris) and the free rainforest sound is still horrible.,0
Update: The app crashes everyday and I have to reinstall it and customize my settings everyday. I have a premium account but still this happens. Please help! This app is life transforming. I've been using it everyday for four to five hours and I'm getting so much more done. I love it! The only issue is that it crashes frequently and I need to keep uninstalling it and then reinstalling it. It'd be great if the developers looked into that.,0
"This app helps a lot but there's one serious issue now. The tree keeps on withering if I set the timer for 2 hours and continue my work. The reason it states is ""I gave up"", but I didnt! And it happens especially for late night study time. Contacted the developers from in-app support, all in vain. Now don't tell me to report customer service again. I did and you didn't respond",0
"I have the premium version. The app is good but not great. Please fix the following: (1) After a break, when hitting ""plant"" do not go to the forest view. This happens every time. When a user hits plant, it should plant a tree. Too many missed sessions where I hit plant, go to work, only to realize it never started. This is super annoying. (2) While working add a ""Extra 5 Mins"" button. This way you can keep working over, but still be notified when the new deadline occurs",0
"This app does not care about improving. First, although I paid for the app, I cannot visualize the time I have spent per year, weak, or month. Second, when the timer is off, the alarm is barely noticeable which makes it quite easy to realize that the timer is already off. It used to be great, but the developers do not seem to care about future bug fixes or improvement, they are happy simply adding more trees instead of improving more important aspects of the app",0
"The new update is worse. I used to love it but the new interface is not at all good. Almost 60% of the trees are now in the pro version, which leave almost nothing for the non pro version users. And the trees look very small which selection in the new layout. Previously it was good. I hope all these shall be rectified in the later versions",0
I don't get a notification or ringtone when a tree is completed. I have a premium account. All my notification settings are fine and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. But the problem continues. When I log out of my account I get the sound notification on completion of a tree. I don't get the same when I login to my account. This is a really good app and it would be helpful if you correct this.,0
"The app is great but I'm facing an issue. I joined the beta program, but it was crashing so much and just wasn't working so I left the program but now I can't download the public version. Like whenever I try downloading the app it says its the beta version. I uninstall it and installed it more than 10 times and I've waited a day too but it still won't download the public version.",0
"I used to love using forest ever since I downloaded it back in 2018. However, I uninstalled it today. That is because the prettiest trees and plants are now only unlockable if you have premium... if you're a student like me, you might not have the money to afford that. That's very unfortunate because I used to enjoy the app so much, but part of what makes it so appealing is unlocking and collecting different kinds of trees to plant a colorful forest.",0
This app is so useful and it genuinely used to help me revise so much but now it just doesn't work and I don't know why. I'm currently typing this out while its timing me in the background üò≠ it just hasn't worked on my new phone. rip,0
"Tried to purchase the app. The experience wasn't good. The purchase won't work in case any additional google accounts are found on the device. Amount gets debited and later credited back. Happens even after removal of the additional account. Too much time wasted on trying to go through the purchase and reviewing purchase methods. I've made purchases of other apps before, and those were neither a hassle before nor a waste of time.",0
"(pro user) I've been using this app for a long time and never had any problems with it but recently the app keeps crashing and even after re-installing it (works for a couple of minutes), it crashes again! The only way to actually use it is to use the forest extension on my laptop. This is getting really frustrating and I actually liked the app. Can you please fix this issue? Because it seems a lot of other people seems to be experiencing this.",0
i like the idea of planting trees and making a forest..which is really satisfaying. But this app doesn't notify me when the timer is up and it's time for break.. i have to check if the timer is still running and then set the break myself..which is the worst part! and it doesn't allow me to set multiple timer with breaks in between! if they can fix these issues..it would be a useful app,0
"I haven't used this app in months and yet it's eating my battery in the background. Apps that require as many permissions as this one that are running in the background for no apparent reason get uninstalled. Response to developer response: I have automatic updates enabled, so it was up to date. This app is permanently uninstalled now as it can't be trusted with the permissions it requires.",0
"I remember having this app on my iPhone a few years ago and loved it. However, I recently downloaded onto my android phone and it is so much more difficult to navigate. Not to mention, the notifications don't work and are super delayed. So it doesn't tell me that my tree has been planted until i literally go on my phone (which this app is trying to get me to do less off) üò≠ counter intuitive. Really hope this glitch is fixed because I love this app and the idea behind it ü§û",0
"The text on the app doesn't work on chromebooks. I think the app assumes it is in full screen and so makes the text massive despite the app only being open in a small window. I guess varying text sizes are quite hard to do so if you can, just make the text smaller because I don't think people are going to use the app in full screen when they are on a chromebook.",0
"This app is everything I needed and wanted to manage my ADHD except for one thing that makes it useless for me - there is no notification when the timer is up unless I use the distracting background sound.This means I go back constantly to check if I can stop working already. Otherwise I would give 5 stars, love that I could visualize how my efforts build up in different areas of my life, the ease of use, no excess clutter and good statistics. Super disappointed I can't use it.",0
"Very annoying! Before, I enjoyed having a reason to save up and earn more coins, meaning I also revised more, but it had an update which prevents me from buying the trees that I had saved up all my coins for, saying I could only have them if I got 'Pro' (paid version) The only ones available to me were ones that were either free or cost very little. What kind of motivation is that! If that wasn't bad enough, they took away the trees I had already worked hard to buy with the coins I saved up!",0
"I'm pretty disappointed with this new update. I felt annoyed when some of my trees were lost because they are part of the membership version. This app is meant to be about progress, though it is harder to be motivated with a limited amount of plants to save up for. If the app can only allow a limited amount of trees for the free version, I think it would be cool if there were limited edition trees that come and go.",0
"I have used Forest for a while but had to delete it simply because one crucial feature doesn't work: notifications. I start a timer to focus, but then the timer gets stuck and doesn't notify me that the session completed. This happens around 50% of the time. I tried all the fixes for Samsung phones from Forest's own website, but still I don't get notified. To my understanding, the fault is on Samsung and how it makes apps doze off, but that doesn't change that the app doesn't function properly.",0
"Great app to keep focused but too many glitches as you can tell from other reviews. For me it has crashed in the passed. Currently the problem is that the vibration alarm doesn't come on when I'm done my timer, so it's literally failing at it's secondary job, to keep time of your session (1st job is to keep your phone away from you during your study session). Because of the glitch, I have missed a bus a couple times b/c the timer didn't ring. I am displeased. Also the new updates seem unoriginal",0
"Hello, I like the idea of representing time spent studying or working as planting trees. It is fulfilling. Anyways, one problem I have is whenever I switch on the wifi after starting the app, or switch it off, the timer in the notification tray stops working, and so I can't track the time. I don't know why it affects it. And the app sends no notification when the timer is done until I go back to the app. I can't keep the app open throughout the day. I hope there'll be something done about this.",0
"I really enjoyed using this app until the September update forced all free users behind a paywall with just a few basic options. In consideration of the pandemic and many folks enjoy the simplicity of this focus app while getting a handle on their own lives, I disagree with the decision of this move. I am not sure what to do with the coins earned since I have all the basic options.",0
"I don't use this app anymore because of the update that made a lot of previously free features, like ""whitelisting"" apps, premium features only. I'm not going to pay for features on this app that I used to have for free. The free version of the app is basically just a timer now, you have to pay for anything else, so I'm going to find another app.",0
"There are fun things about this app and I go in and out of using it for focus and to challenge myself to spend time on tasks I don't feel like working on... However, a big problem is that it uses battery even if you have not used the app. I have not used this app in several days (and several restarts), and in the last 24 hours it used 7% of my battery. Not acceptable!",0
"I love this app for studying and it came out with a TinyTan version. Being a BTS fan, of course, I had to get my hands onto it. The payment process was easy but I noticed that not much of it is changed compared to the normal version. Really disappointing because I had to pay $4.00 just to get the add-on but had to pay $5.00 on top of that just to get enough crystals to buy 1 member. I thought I had a steal with the add-on being $4. I feel scammed and I'm not sure how to get my money back.",0
The idea is better than the execution. Buying things from the store requires you to create an account in their app rather than using the play store account. Creating an account requires you to enter a birthday which uses a horrible calendar form that requires you to arrow-over every month in every year until you get to your birthday. I'm not doing that... The sound turns off randomly (before the end of the session). Switching to another app doesn't trigger in session warning consistently.,0
"I wanted to like it, but many dealbreakers. No alarm at end of session. No way to automatically go between breaks and work sessions, no way to automatically alternate between short and long breaks, no way to customize alarms that signify end of session. Contacted premium support re: no alarm- no response. Also- when you enter your birthday to register for premium, it's in a calendar form- it's much easier to enter a birthday by typing mm/dd/yyyy or to use a drag down menu for m, d, and year.",0
"UPDATED TO 2 STARS I am frustrated. I used to enjoy using this app, as I am a chronic procrastinator and Forest helped me stay focused during study blocks. However, they keep removing features from the free version and making them premium only. I was honestly considering upgrading to premium before the updates, but this move just feels like an attempt to grab more money. All of my favorite trees are now locked to premium users only. It just feels slimy. I'll keep my money, thanks.",0
"Sadly, not as motivating as I thought. I thought I would see a plant dynamically growing (eg. 1 leaf every minute) and moving, which would introduce real stakes -- it would actually feel like, if I open another app, this living plant would die. Instead, this is very static and fake-looking. There seem to be a few static images of the plant, 1 per growth stage -- so the plant starts off at the first stage, shows no change or movement or any signs of life for a long time (eg. 15 mins), then suddenly skips to the next stage, at which point it again just sits there without moving for a long time, etc. Because of this, you see no dynamic change or growth, the plant does not feel real and it did not feel like a big deal to ""kill"" this super fake unchanging plant.",0
"Great concept, but unfortunately have to uninstall as it's a data privacy risk. Our firewall detected (and blocked) hundreds of attempts to servers in China when the app was sitting open but idle. For its function, this app should be able to run locally without call outs unless there's an error state. Combine this with the permissions required, and it's too risky for my comfort. Hope to find a safer option elsewhere.",0
"I can't speak to the efficacy of the program but the language here is absurd for a self-help app. Looking at the app while the timer is going says ""Stop phubbing!"" and ""get back to work!"" choosing to end the timer is called ""giving up"" and places a dead tree in your garden that must be removed. I find it hard to look past the weirdly hostile presentation of this app to get to the self-help part. Can't recommend.",0
"I loved this app for a long time, however since an update early in the year the app keeps killing my tree randomly part way through the timer despite me not unlocking or sometimes even touching my phone. I contacted the dev and gave it 6 months in hopes it would be resolved, but unfortunately it looks like this app isn't for me anymore. I hope it works better on your phone! When it works it's great!",0
"This is a great app with misleading/unethical privacy problems. I paid for the full version expecting to be able to use the full version, but I can't use the features without giving my personal information (name, email, birthday). I tried to add my birthday to sign up, even though I'm really not happy with the privacy and data collection, but you tap several hundred times to get to the right year (for example, if you are 32, you have lived 384 months, and you have to tap through all of it).",0
"Good but needs simple improvement = It should really have more ringtone (and a light notification) options for when the time is up. I don't want to that horrible alarm sound or have my phone vibrate after every study session in order to know when to take a break. If you don't add more sounds, please give us the option to create customized sounds/ringtones. Also, for the S9, it is unable to make a noise in silent mode, even when I give the app exception permissions.",0
"Regret purchasing premium... Most of the time, my phone usage doesn't record even though I keep it running in the background. Other times it will say I have been on my phone ALL DAY, when I haven't. It doesn't record how many times I pick up the phone. The only thing that works on my premium app version are the free features. I've had this app for about two weeks after purchase. At this point, I wish the developers would just give me a refund.",0
"This app has definitely helped me put my phone down, but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards. After using it for six months, I've run out of trees and plants to purchase, so there's not much more to ""add"" to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins. When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before.",0
"It's an interesting idea, but this app missed some extremely important features, namely: a landscape mode, as well as a custom notification sound. Why? Those are extremely easy features to add! My use case is placing my phone on a stand in landscape mode so I can charge it while at work. I want a custom notification sound at work, and I want to be able to watch the timer go down without the screen stuck in portrait. Also, I keep the screen on, and the app disses me because I have the app open.",0
"I love this app BUT it doesn't have landscape mode so it's a deal breaker for me. I have my tablet attached to the wall in my office so I can't change the orientation. I would love to be able to run this app on that tablet and see it right in front of me but because it doesn't support landscape mode I can't use it. So disappointing. Also, I'd love you to add a tick tock background sound (from a clock). Other apps have it and it helps me focus better than anything else. Otherwise a 5 star app!!",0
"Used to love this app. Was disappointed when they added a premium version and locked some trees, but I understand the decision. HOWEVER, they also took away trees that had already been purchased by people without premium accounts, which to me seems ridiculous. They did refund the coins, but now that I've unlocked all the trees with the free version, there's nothing to work for. Considering switching to another app.",0
"Just installed it on my latest tablet. It worked great for two days, then tonight, froze up and I had to cold crash/reset the tablet. Tried reopening the app and, it was still counting down but instead of the 20ish minutes it had been stuck on before, it showed over 40000 minutes!!!  Tried the ""Give Up"" option but it wouldn't work. The app then froze again--had to reset the tablet again. Ended up just chucking/uninstalling it. Can't really use it if it's going to freeze like that. And, now that I'm reading some of the other recent reviews, this seems to be an ongoing problem.  And Forest just asked for screenshots of the problem in their reply to my review. I don't think you understand the term ""frozen""--if I could take screenshots of the issue, the tablet wouldn't be frozen and require a cold crash. I won't be reinstalling the app just to attempt to take screen shots, thank you.",0
"To say that this app drastically improved my productivity is an understatement. But there are a lot of downsides that ruin the experience, like being unable to pause the timer when you want to grab a snack or go to the bathroom, or ending it in case you finish early. The only thing you can do is 'give up'. You also don't hear any sound when the timer finishes. And you get a very low amount of coins per session. No dark mode. All of this is coming from a Pro user.",0
"Inconsistent with regard to what counts as focus time and what doesn't. I'd have my screen off for more time than the tree would grow but it would fail, yet I could play music from an app and it recognized me not actively using my cell phone. Edit: I followed the instructions and am still having the same problem. Also, their instructions are so vague and outdated that I had to have another person help me.",0
"I really liked this app at first and upgraded to premium for the chance to get real trees planted. However, I was really disappointed that I'm limited to having 5 real trees planted. I get that it costs money, but I paid for premium and watch all these ads, so there should be some money available for planting real trees. Even if I had to save up 10,000 coins to plant a real tree, I'd still be motivated to use the app. Without that incentive, I find I'm not motivated at all, and I'll just donate to an organization that plants trees instead.  I know that this is not the main purpose of the app, but I feel like I was misled about what I'd be getting for my premium upgrade.  Edit: To clarify, per the response from the developer: I did pay for the Pro account and was able to ""plant"" 5 real trees, which is great. I was just taken by surprise that pro account was limited to 5 real trees. I'll be donating directly to the non-profit partner going forward and the $1.99 I paid for the pro upgrade could have gone to them directly instead.",0
"I love the idea but few things bug me: should you pick a background sound and cancel the growing phase, the sound keeps playing. You can literally turn your screen off the sound will still playing and there's no icon to deactivate it since you canceled the growing phase, remember? My phone is always set for on no disturb mode, I get no sound and no notification from the app at all, not even a led notification. Should I switch to silent mode or even ring mode, same problem (Oneplus 3T). Long story short I always ago over the time allocated, for nothing. I don't know when my tree is done. No breaks after a 25 mins session. EDIT : done everything listed below, the problem remains the same. Notifications work just fine with other apps, just saying.",0
"I really enjoyed the app before I signed up and paid for pro. This is because I didn't even get ads but after signing up Im annoyed by things like the ""refer friends"" banner that I can never permanently close in the store and the red icon on the achievements even though they've been collected. If I paid for pro I expect a less cluttered experience (there wasn't clutter before when I didn't have a profile). Remove the distractions and prompts.",0
I downloaded the app used it ..loved it but then due to changing of email I had to delete it before buying the premium...and then when I again downloaded the app all my hard earned coins and tress were gone ...pls solve this problem I don't know how to backup all the data ..pls respond!,0
"I was so satisfied with the app that I decided to purchase the pro version and couldn't be more disappointed since then. The so called ""pro"" has so many optional features behind a pay-wall, that it looks like how the free version of it should be. Moreover, once in a while i'm being advertised about those, which is outraging. Once I pay for something, I expect the full functionality. Also, rewarded achievements based on the score in the leaderboard make no sense, as they only coerce cheating.",0
"I used this app frequently some years ago and decided to try it out again now. The interface changed dramatically and is less intuitive for me right now. A lot of the trees and bushes that were previously unlockable to all users are now behind a paywall. The selection of free plants is laughable. The main attraction of this app is gone, so I'm switching to a normal timer.",0
"Definitely worked as said, if I could properly use it, I think it would be easy to cure phone addiction. However, there still are some bugs and stuff that resulted me to uninstall and install it again quite a number of time. And honestly, Its not that fun if it keeps crashing as you are away from your phone. I thought I finally grew a tree, turns out it crashed halfway. Imagine having to uninstalled & install the app three times a day. Pls fix this. I have great expectation from this app",0
"Looks nice, but communication-wise the app can be quite damaging feeding into negative thought patterns. A strong example of this is its inability to be 'understanding' toward the flexibility of life. So when I want to pause the 25 minutes to empty the dishwasher or get the door I have to click 'give up' ?! Laughable. Shame. The design of the app with the trees is incredible though. Yet uninstalled due to the wording.",0
Overall great app but for someone reason when i close the app the tree i planted keeps growing.,0
"Basically can't use the app unless you pay for ""elite bennefits"" which allows you to accurately label the task you are completing or you have to use the one of the few that come with the app.",0
I really hate the fact that trees look different depending on how much time you set. I like to study for 25 minutes and take small breaks in-between my studying sessions but I have to do like 2 hours straight if I want the trees to actually look fully grown and pretty like I thought they'd look when I bought them. disappointing.,0
"It used to be a very nice app. I've been using it over an year...but now with the new Android update, or my pixel mobile. It no longer blocks when I open an app. So it kinda beats it's purpose. I am a pro member. Please help me. Otherwise, it deserves an 5 star!",0

"the app is nice, but it's silly that on the free version of this app, when you want to restart the timer it makes you watch an ad, which is taking away from the productivity of your time...",0
not very helpful. I tried the chrome extensions and did not like the experience. I wish I could set a session time and total focus time so the app will create the amount of sessions needed plus breaks,0
"This app is a very good for recording the data we focus on but, the only problem which I am facing in this update is that this app never remained me to take rest when the timer is complete. Due to this I work overtime ther by breaking the pomodoro. So I kindly request the developers to fix this issue as soon as possible...! Thank you.",0
"I used to like this app a lot but now a lot of things are limited and requires the pro version. I think it's still alright for people who would use the app less but as someone who initially used this app a lot, the new 5 times a week limit has been a huge disappointment for me.",0
I like this app but why it only allow me to focus 4 times a week? I am a student so I spend more than 4 times a week to study or doing assignmnent. Please make the time unlimited. I dont care about the type of tree because I can use the coin earned. Make the app more convience for student. If I only need to focus 4 times a week I don't need app to make me.,0
"Would be quite useful but gets stuck on an ad for ""total battle: war strategy"" and never lets you out ever again, so you may as well just set a timer such does essentially the same thing without aggressive ads üôÑ",0
Please add one important feature that if we use the phone or goto next screen/app then that's over so in this way tendency to use phone reduces. Even if something is being planted we might check phone and waste time also main aim for this app to avoid wasting time. This is my genuine suggestion,0
This app used to work but a while back it stopped working. I use (and paid for) the custom allow list which used to work but now it doesn't. If I'm using first and accidentally go on Instagram or something it doesn't take you back to forest or show the timer. I heard going back to default works but I need some of these apps to work. I hope you can fix this.,0
its mid ..when the timer reaches the limit i need it to alert me by a loud ring so that i would i know my sess is over for now ..cz i barely can hear the ring and work exceedingly than what is required!,0
"App does it's job however I paid the subscription years ago (2018) in hopes they would keep improving the app on the Android platform... They did not deliver, sure we got some new trees out of it but really? It's been two years since iOS got widgets and we've still never got anything of the sort! It's a feature that would help me stay motivated to use the app more and remind me to stay productive.",0
Love this app. Helps me stay focused. Also I can add Google to whitelist so i can search for study stuff online while studying. Edit: I just shifted to an Apple device. I decided to buy the Pro version to sync my plants. However I realised then I can't download the app on Apple and sync and have to purchase it again. It's a real bummer and I'm sure many people have faced this issue. Please please fix it. I know it's possible since Duolingo allows it. The rating is just 2 get developer attention.,0
"Good but one major flaw. I love using this app to stay on track for work, and keep track of my work hours. The problem is the app automatically stops tracking after 3 hours, so half way through my work it just stops and I have to remember to turn it back on. Please remove the limit, or at least increase it to 5 or 6 hours, even if it doesnt plant extra trees past the 3 hour mark that is fine. Trees can be a bonus, accurately tracking my work should be a priority.",0
"It doesn't work sometimes. I am currently writing this review while in Deep Focus mode. Means I can open app while at it. Maybe this is a bug or whatever but it happens too ofte.

"I used to love this app, like it was literally my favorite. It was so great! Now, it won't work right. I'm still able to open apps that aren't on the allow list and it defeats the whole purpose.

Sharing your phone data to third party,0
"used to love it but now it's getting ridiculous to keep paying for just UNLIMITED focus session which is ridiculous for me. Overall, other functions are great and all except the fact you need to pay for most of the things.",0
This app is really good . But I'm unable to purchase the pro version for some reason.,0
The premium version is so annoying it always reminds me to get a premium and also very limited access is there!,0
I don't know y they have still not added the Pause option while focusing.... Seriously please consider this time !!....We have bathroom breaks and some unexpected situations to handle...Pause option is a must!!..and also make full screen option available,0

"why doesn't it give alarm sound or beep when the period of focus is over,tried doing whatever app suggests but in vain . otherwise app would HV got 5 star",0
The defeats its own purpose. I installed it to decrease screen time and focus but had to uninstall it as when once I opened another app and used another app and was there for a long time but when I came back to forest app nothing had happened to the tree and it was growing. That discovery defeated all the purpose of mine installing the app,0
"It's alright. I wish the button wasn't ""give up"" to end a session because that felt really insulting. I wish the planting real trees wasn't locked behind a paywall. And I wish that it was easier to do pomodoro sessions without having to click a button for every focus time and every break time. Why can't it just be a continuous cycle with little sound notifications of a change to a break or a focus? It was an okay app, but it could be much better.",0
I accidentally reseted my phone and this app started from beginning. There is no login option and I have to begin from scratch it would be awesome if I can login and start where I left last time,0
i used to love this coz this seriously helps me study.. but now i have to pay for me to focus study.. not worth it,0

"This used to be a solid app. It did the job but would take you off of Do Not Disturb whenever you hit start which was a mild inconvenience but still annoying. It only worked half of the time at keeping you from straying to other apps while the timer was on. However, their decision to change their app so that only a few trees are available in the free version while anything of any visual worth is only in the paid version was the final issue that led me to uninstalling the app. Lost a star for their copy & paste answer to everyone suddenly leaving low reviews.",0
"I really enjoy the app and like the idea but am probably going to stop using it. I can't figure out a way to have an audible notification play when a focus period is completed without having my ring volume on. Other Pomodoro apps i have tried don't seen to have this issue and I like to audible alert, as I is vibrations from the phone when focusing.",0
"It's alright. I wish the button wasn't ""give up"" to end a session because that felt really insulting. I wish the planting real trees wasn't locked behind a paywall. And I wish that it was easier to do pomodoro sessions without having to click a button for every focus time and every break time. Why can't it just be a continuous cycle with little sound notifications of a change to a break or a focus? It was an okay app, but it could be much better.",0
"Help Forest team!!! Please note. A genuinely helpful app if followed with honesty.üôÇI've been using it for around a month & have definitely improved with focusing.But not a 5-star rating? This evening the app crashed & then did not open at all. I even tried rebooting the phone, trying to clear cache(there was none),etc.And thus with no other option, in order to continue using the app,I had reinstall it. Edit: Update-It keeps crashing. I have to uninstall & reinstall it almost everyday.üòü",0
"It's been a long ride with this app - when I first downloaded it years and years ago, it had super useful features that weren't locked behind a paywall yet. However, I stuck with it even when features that I once was able to use suddenly became 'member only', but this recent upgrade was the last straw - free members now only have 4 focus sessions per week üòÖ Wild how things change so quickly, but I'll be finding another productivity app from now on",0
"A neat idea, but something is very wrong with this app. It drained 25% of my battery power in one day, more than all my other apps combined, that is so much, my phone is noticeably warmer when this is installed and in the background. I don't know if this is deliberate/malicious, but this is apparently a long standing issue for many others and has not been fixed.",0
"I use to love this app and used it often to break phone addiction. However, the update has caused me to lose ALL of my previously unlocked trees! I've had this app for nearly 2 years to help study. I unlocked maple, willow, carnations, etc and they were all taken away?! I have lost motivation to keep using this app. I already understand that you updated it to handle piracy issues, but the result is that most people including myself are extremely disappointed.",0
The app has been working fine for the past two or three months since I downloaded it but in the past two weeks it has started crashing whilst the timer was on. I rely on this app more than I'd like to admit so I could really do with this being fixed. I haven't been able to find any acknowledgement of this from the developers.,0
"Great idea. I am an environmentalist and absolutely loved the concept. I use Vivo phone. My concern is that the App keeps crashing after a day of use as soon as I open. Tried to switch off, reinstall latest 4.7.3 version and also use beta version. I would like to use it regularly, recommend others and if it doesn't crash, I would certainly buy it. Please consider fixing the crashes asap. I have already reviewed the comments and found that it keeps crashing on most Vivo phones. Please note that I have tried the latest version upon your request in reply to this review. Can't wait to give you 5 stars after its use. Please let me know when you fix the issue.",0
"Was considering purchasing pro but I don't understand why the notification sound from trees completion never happens. If I'm focusing on a task I would never know when the timer is done. I've tried multiple tweaks with the app settings (enabling notification, ringtone mode is not silent, enabling keep the screen on) and phone settings (all notifications were turned on, tried changing notification sound). My phone's volume for all ringtone, media, notification and system is not mute.",0
"Love the concept if it worked. The whole premise of not leaving the app in fear of killing your tree was not existent as I could easily browser other apps while the tree grew in the background. The message asking if I wanted to kill the tree only came up when I pressed ""back"". When I pressed home or swiped to another app, it stayed running in the background. This doesn't prevent me from procrastination.",0
"This used to be one of my favorite apps for when I was studying. It really inspired me, especially when I wanted to buy a really nice plant, because I had to work for it. BUT now? I think almost every pretty plant is premium. Thats no fair! I was saving up and watching ads, now I have a lot of coins I don't know or want to spend in anything. The worst part is that the app never said anything, it was just an update. It really felt so underhanded and unfair.",0
"The new updates are terrible: 1. Great idea making deep focus optional, but mine keeps reverting back to it even when I deselect. 2. No alert sound when designated period is over. What's the point of this app then? I have to constantly keep checking the time and that's worse for concentration. An alarm clock is better. 3. The coins earned during extra time are never added to the total. 4. Planting reminder doesn't work. I was a loyal supporter, but I'm going to uninstall now. Too many problems",0
"Great idea, I love the interface and even paid for the premium version. HOWEVER, your tree NEVER dies. You can use any app (whitelisted or not) and the tree is NOT dying...it simply continues to grow. It is really annoying to know that the main feature why I have installed the app is not working. Everything else e.g. tagging, rooms, tree shop etc. works, but without the main feature it feels like buying a car that you are not allowed to drive... P.s. I have the latest version of the app",0
"Can't change the name of goals. I wanted to go for different subjects. Also, have to start the timer to change the names.",0
"The app is good but in deep focus permissions we have to ""give floating window appears"" which is not available in vivoYO2 and many other devices",0
"The app works fine but the adds are inexcusable Some adds are okay but not on this level Unskipable video add which after they are finished automatically open de app from the add in google store without clicking on anything. Then when you go back to the app the add is still there, you have to wait more then there is a cross to finally close the add and then you get another fullscreen add about paying to get rid of adds. This is ridiculous and not acceptable",0
"I had brought the premium version then i uninstalled it . After re-installing , when i entered my email and password. It showed invalid user . Please help me out. üò≠ I have paid for it.",0
"I quite liked this app. but you need to add feature to exclude phone from the distraction list. I'm working for two hours, then I have to take a work-related call, and it all goes down to zero, like I've spent the whole day on twitter! And all I see is a forest of dead trees. Some people use this app to manage attention deficit, so you've got no idea how frustrating is to see yourself going back to square zero. Fix it. Until then - 1 star for aggravating the situation instead of helping.",0
"This app used to be fantastic: the free version with ads was usable and fair as well. But now they've locked literally every tree behind a paywall so there's no incentive to save up coins any more. Good job - your greed killed the functionality of the app. Uninstalled. Time to support other app developers who, y'know, don't change integral features in order to gain more coin. EDIT: Developer response is copy and paste, which shows how much they care.",0
"I cannot log in to my old account since I have to buy the pro version in order to log in at first. So my past progress is lost. Also, I cannot purchase the pro version neither: 'error(6)' I have reinstalled, forced stop, cleared cache, etc multiple times. I have added a paying method to my google play account as well. Nothing has helped and I haven't received an answer to my email to you yet. This makes me sad because I like the app to much to deinstall it.",0
"The attracting feature of this app were the variety of trees; this was also an incentive to study more, as that (if you used the app correctly) was the only way to unlock new tree species. You've taken this feature away for most users and kept a few, bland trees, as an obvious tactic to boost purchases, which is annoying. What's even more annoying is the disingenuous replies of ""pirated software"", (09/09/2020 response). Was going to give a 2 or 3 since it's now just an average app, but now a 1",0
"This app was a 5-star, but with the new update you have to be pro to unlock almost all the trees. I always watched all the ads to help the developers in some way, but now I don't think it's worth it, since they've only become money driven. I had been earning coins for almost months to buy a tree that was 2000 coins. Such a pity the app has turned into this. I will still use it, but I won't watch any more ads. So disappointing.",0
I loved this app and used it often when studying or wanting to have a break from my phone. A recent update has limited the focus sessions to only 5 per week which is ridiculous since I normally do 45-90 minute sessions and easily go through 5 in 1 day. Great concept however they have gotten greedy and make it necessary to upgrade to the pro version for it to be usable now.,0
"It is a great app. It helped me a lot to focus while I was studying. It gives me an extra motivation to study ,just so I can grow my forest. But I wish more things were available for free mini necessary features are behind a paper wall. Edit : I am giving it 1 star due to recent change in shop Now the shop is trash and tells that you are greedy for money",0
"I can easily exit the app by clicking the home button and go anywhere I want to. The purpose of the app is to stop us from navigating other apps which I don't see getting fulfilled. I can Even go to tabs that I opened and didn't exit without my tree being killed. At first, I didn't know that it was that easy to fool the app,but after tad a bit of time,I realized that it was pretty easy to open youtube while my tree was growing and still ensure that my forest is lush and green. It's lame.",0
Spyware. I use a debug form of android and it opens in the background and gathers data.,0
"The recent update is bad. The app was working just fine before, and the UI is very iconic to Forest. One look at a screenshot and I can tell its from Forest. What is this recent update for? The Forest tab got a new design that honestly doesn't look great and a lot harder to read from before, not to mention the lag that came with it. There was mild lag before but it never affected my experience previously. I'm really disappointed with the new update.",0
I installed this in my son's phone pixel 6A and paid for the lifetime subscription and now found out that he had loophole as he removed the lock by removing the app from recent apps and playing games Or you can update the app that one can not remove it from recent apps that would be more helpful,0
Bro is NOT like flora . At least flora doesn't charge to add friends and chnage settings wtaf,0
"Kinda stupid, while the app runs in the background you can use other apps. Not what it supposed to do. You should loose your tree when you use the phone while you are on a break",0
"1) it shows error 66 and 598 on android and you fail to login if you are pro user. 2) support doesn't reply to your e-mail when you try to reach for help. 3) in apple(ipad) you can't split the screen with other app. 4) morrover, it doesn't allow to have a allow list for apps on apple(ipad) so your forced to use it without deep focus feature or shut down the app, it makes it worthless. Making it less user-friendly and basic which you can get in another apps for free, don't not waste your money.",0
I used to LOVE this app. I thought it was great that for your every purchase they planted a tree in the world. But then I noticed that they had changed that feature and you needed to have the premium account to do that. Okay that's fine. Weird but fine. Then I recently reset my phone so I had to login to all my apps. I realized that all my achievements from forest were gone! Now you had to have the premium account even to log in?! My progress used to be a motivation. So disappointed.,0
The app hasn't been opening for the last 2 weeks. Happened for the 2nd time in 3 months.The app is updated. Reinstalling after uninstalling deletes past records and all bought plant species.Very disappointing. Is this a deliberate attempt at forcing us to upgrade to Pro/Premium versions?Won't recommend any longer. Highly disappointed. Sent a mail too.,0
"Before the update, this app has been with me throughout all my studying sessions and it was so so motivating and fun to use! I've been religiously watching all the ads to get the double coins to save up to get the trees. After the update, I am absolutely DEVASTATED because I can't even buy any new trees because they are all premium. This was a terrible update because you just made it so hard to use for students who can't afford to get premium. I don't mind watching 10000 more ads!",0
"REVIEW UPDATE: Not sometimes, now it's frequently happening that I can close the forest app and bypass the whole purpose. I can then use my phone to its full extent and forest is absolutely useless to me. I will have to try some other app. Old review: Sometimes the app lets me open apps and get through. The option to select 120 mins is great but they need to patch this bypass bug that's been happening. I'm on a pixel 2XL",0
"it's bugged. there are times when i can open it fine and there are times that i have to click multiple times and delete data for me to reopen the app. and once i do that, i no longer have the option to change the settings for deep work which basically leads to the app not being useful anymore. i have tried to uninstall and reinstall the app a couple of times but it is still the same thing. i am super disappointed.",0
"I loved your application. Just enjoying focusing on my work and collecting coins and unlucking new trees meantime. But after updating, I lost the trees I unlocked before! And I can't unlock them again unless I upgrade to pro version! It's not fair! It was ok if you put the trees which were in free version into pro version. But losing the trees I unlocked before?!! Not acceptable!",0
"Useless. I PAID to use this app. I can't recover my account after changing phone, not only because the button is inaccessible (and burried in menus) but because you can't if you have multiple Google accounts on your device! They suggest you to log out from all of them instead of managing the issue properly (which I can't, I don't have only this app on my phone lol!). And they don't even bother replying to direct emails. Shameful.",0
Okay so it's really not working for me. In the deep focus mode I can open any app no matter if the Whitelist mode is on or off. When it's on I can still access the blacklisted apps and when it's off instead of being inaccessible to ANY app it happens the other way around. Even the notifs keep coming. All this despite the app having access to permissions needed to block it. KINDLY FIX IT ASAP. If it keeps working like this it's definitely not gonna help suppress phone-addiction...,0
"When I update the app it doesn't work. I have a Samsung Galaxy J7. Please do something about it!! :( Once I update the app and try to open it it says ""Unfortunately Forest ahs stopped working"" Even if I restart my phone it doesn't work. And even though its 1 tree at a time it grows 2 trees or 4 trees. It divided the time in a weird manner and grows those many trees.",0
It won't kill my tree when I leave the app and when I press the i button to change it and go to change its permissions it doesn't let me. I have gone onto settings on my own and I have given it alk the permissions I can. I have u installed multiple times but it doesn't work. Do not recommend at all I tried emailing the provided email address but it said that there was a problem with the address. Not happy and definitely not worth the fuss of downloading,0
"Disappointed. All the beautiful trees now belong to the pro version. I collected the coins to buy some of them, but now I just can't. It's unfair. They could introduce some new beautiful trees available only in pro version, that would be completely understandable. Their reply to all the same reviews is just ctrl+c ctrl+v. Very disappointing",0
"Without deep focus mode one can use other apps without risking the lives of growing trees in the forest. But enabling deep focus mode requires the app's access to notifications including personal text messages, which seems like too much information to give. And without deep focus mode the whole purpose of using the app is defeated. The app's become useless with this new update. The previous version was better at serving the purpose. Please change this ASAP.",0
"The new feature sucks! I purchased the pro version, but the whitelist feature doesn't even work properly. The deep focus mode is not allowing you to use your whitelisted app and when using the other mode in the background you can pretty much use all other apps. Waste of money. Do not go for the pro version. Very disappointed with this app. Going to uninstall it.",0
"Doesn't work Typing this as I have a tree growing with 8 minutes left and it's still counting down.. EDIT: After updating to all the latest versions doesn't work. Just to let you know that this issue is intermittent and not all the time, but most of the time. EDIT: I have emailed that email address for support but the email was not delivered ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0
"Forest was my favorite app so far. But I'm disappointed about a facture. That I need to pay for backup. I have been using this app from October 2022. I used it everyday. I thought to set a goal that I'll use it this whole year and see my studying time. But unfortunately, my phone got restarted for an issue. Then I lost everything. It upsets me. I think you should made the facture that we don't need to purchase to make a backup account. It would be really nice. Now I have to use another app..",0
"Crashes consistently. I bought the premium version and while the app does serve its purpose well, it crashes way too often. I'm always forced to uninstall and reinstall it. This defeats the purpose of the app. Clearing app data and cache take it to some Chinese/SE Asian language version where I can't even login. Please fix this issue or suggest a solution.",0
"For some unknown reason, my server was set in China when I registered for my account. Since I do not live in China, all my friends were on the international server so I cannot add anyone of them... I also realized I cannot switch my server to international one which is extremely annoying.... The music/white noises in the app also automatically stops after my phone goes to sleep üòÖ Overall not a very good experience. I really wish for either a refund or a change in server.",0
"Wow I can't believe I'm typing this but ever since I went premium I was able to enter the app the first few times then it crashes every time I try to open the app, which is ridiculous. Not sure if my best friend experiences this as she is on iOS, but I bought the premium as a way to bond better with people offline. Disappointing. Seems like a scam. You got your money then boom! Doesn't work.",0
I gave it five stars before but since the latest update I can't log in normally to my account anymore though I've paid for the pro version. It feels like they made it harder to log back in so we'll buy the pro version again but hey that's just me. They make it such a hassle just to log back in.,0
"I loved using this app, collecting points, unlocking a new variety of tree, I've been using it for years now... But gradually it started separating more and more features for premium users, and now, in September 2020 I found out almost all the trees are segregated for premium users too! Yes, it still helps me keep off my phone, but the scoring and new tree method is gone for me (which used to be kinda motivating) and I feel really left out. It's like the app makers hate the free users.",0
"This is the worst update ever! It upright draws up on your home screen and you literally can't do anything. You can't use the whitelisted apps then what is the deep focus mode even for? Such a waste and you basically need control of the whole mobile including notifications. And the response team they don't even care. The best thing you can do now is roll back to the previous version. If anyone is facing the same issue, hit the post was helpful button, it at least helps them to notice this issue",0
"Too big. No need for the free version to have this size when it doesn't use cloud. Next time separate free vs. paid. I don't do emails so I'll just use the extension or something since this is so much hassle. I suspect automated response. Zero stars, if I could... (Update, I see responses are totally automatic. I will never pay for an app that doesn't even have actual responses to the reviews... I think I'll use that other tree growing app.)",0
"with the newest update i have to give permissions im not comfortable with, but without the permissions its as good as useless, it lets me access whatever app without the tree withering. i will no longer be using this app unless they restore the previous version, or there is an option for deep focus without so many sketchy permission requests, like they had before.",0
"I was really excited about the whole idea of this app, but theres this huge down side that I cant accept. I hate how the whitelist option to use your apps without killing your trees is ONLY if you pay MONEY. Which is ridiculously frustrating because I have 5 specific apps I need as an artist and use on a daily basis. I was looking forward to planting my forest while working on my pictures. But NO! Disappointing! That one specific feature should absolutely be on the standard app option.",0
"This may be because I've only tried the free version, but it does not prevent me from using literally anything else. If I use the back arrow directly out of the app, it will prompt the ""do you want to leave/kill your tree?"", but if I use the home button to navigate away, or use any of my notifications to navigate away, there is no prompt and my tree still grows even though I'm not being productive/playing on my phone. Kinda defeats the purpose unfortunately..",0
"I love the idea and I couldn't wait to try. But it's not an option if you have a smartwatch connected. As soon as I planted a tree and sat down to focus using timer mode, my smartwatch started alerting me every 2 seconds that a tree was still growing. And the alerts are happening so quickly I can't block that app on my smartwatch before another alert occurs. I turned off all of the notifications in the settings in the Forest app, and it's still sending these alerts to my smartwatch every 2 sec.",0
"Very disappointed with the new update and will be uninstalling this app. They have locked almost every single tree except for about 10, so that you can't buy anything without getting the Pro version. I used to watch every ad to help out since I didn't have Pro, but now it's pointless to keep using the app since the fun has been taken away completely unless you pay money. Such a pity because this is a great concept but it's unbelievable that they would do this to so many of their dedicated users.",0
"Bad experience with my 2017 A8 tablet. First the app crased several times and my device would just auto reboot. Then when I try to give up or close the app totally but the forest ambient music won't just turn off. I had to uninstall app to turn off that music. Now I've installed it on my pixel 3a, hoping for a bttr performance this time.",0
"Was good, until they disabled the basic functionality of the app and put it behind a pay wall. It isn't even worth downloading if you aren't prepared to pay for the premium version. It also keeps saying that it won't work if the permissions are disabled, but I enabled every permission I could in settings and it wouldn't even ask for more. I finally got it to work after messing with a bunch of settings, and found that it has blocked my phone's launcher.",0
"This last update doesn't allow phone calls or messages to work, which is the whole point of a phone. Could we get the old version back where all the trees were available and phone still works? Thx In response to your note, ""we have a new tree every month"". False, no new one for free in a long time. And you keep saying ""buy the pro"", which is specifically asked you not to say. Fix the issues, don't do a money grab. It shouldn't control the UI. Can we get the 2018 version back?",0
"They just change the terms without prior notification that the tree I brought which later became pro version are all dissapeared! I don't want the refund coins which I already unlock all free trees. I was a very loyal user for this app, I watched every advertisement pushed, and planted thousands of trees last year. It feels really bad and I would never use this app ever again.",0
"**so you need premium for it to actually work? Deep focus mode just mentions reminders to come back to the app nothing about it being necessary for the app to work. That should be explained I really love the idea but it won't work, if I'm outside of the app on other apps it'll still fully grow the tree even if I was out of the app for the entire timer (I've done tests). I found a switch that was off for ""wither the tree when forest is closed"" and I turned it on but it didn't change anything",0
"I really enjoy the app, but you should do something about free users not being able to access/purchase all the trees, especially ones they've already unlocked! I'm a pro user, and I still don't see how that's fair to them. One of the main incentives in the app is being able to earn coins and unlock new trees - without that, it's not as interesting",0
"I hate that the white list feature was added to only premium; everything else, I could understand, but without the white list, it's nearly impossible to actually use your phone as a resource while studying. It makes the app nearly useless. Until they replace the white list, I'll be finding another app to use that isn't as inconsiderate of their users.",0
"It's a cool concept but bad execution. The coin reward system is very gimmicky and not at all conducive to a soothing environment you would expect a digital forest to have. What's more concerning is if you are in deep focus abd give the app all of those concerning permissions to monitor you, it doesn't let you use your phone at all with no option to stop, even in an emergency. You have to go back into the app and close out the task. This is insanely stupid and hopefully will be addressed.",0
"I installed this because I was looking for something to help me focus. I openeditto see how it worked, started a tree and then closed it to see what would happen. Well, it started sending notifications to my watch. Every two seconds my watched buzzed. I could not stop or dismiss the notifications. So, I opened the app back up and the notifications persisted. So I Uninstalled the app. I still don't know how it works or what it does. I just know I can't focus with my watch buzzing constantly.",0
"I was really enjoying the free version, there were actually some really cute plants. I debated going to the paid version but it was only $2 so I finally did it and since I was changing phones I figured why not. THEN when I tried to sign in on my other device it wouldn't let me even when I signed out of my other emails like it suggested. So it charged me $2 more to sign back in!! Ridiculous!!!! Fix this!!! 9/13/20 I was charged again for logging in on a different device!",0
"This used to be my favourite app for work, but the excellent main feature, as enhanced by the clean UX and cute art, are completely ruined by the integration of ads in my face after every tree is done growing. I refuse to pay for the way the app used to be. Mourning the extremely useful and beautiful app I first downloaded years ago, and off to seek a replacement.",0
"This app requires a ridiculous amount of permissions, including location, camera, and data cookies?? When I heard about this app, I got excited. Really thought it was going to be nothing more than say an animated timer that only works when you stay within the app (like Youtube pauses when you switch apps). This is just downright data mining and invasive. Edit: Funny that I mentioned this and now it doesn't say the same thing.",0
"I'm really puzzled by all the awards this year app has mentioned in the description. For an app that is supposed to help you focus it fails miserably. The bad behavior of the app is motivated by the profit seeking motive of the developer. I had started a tree then I jumped into a teleconference with a coworker, the app was vibrating so intensely I thought my phone was getting a call or a serious alert. It's not a problem to go off once, but it would go off every few minutes. What a distraction!",0
"With the set of new updates, the app has become inconvenient. It doesn't notify you when the time is up, and they made all trees except the originals available only to those who get the paid version and randomly increased the prices of certain trees. Today, I lost all of my purchased trees in the app from the past 3-4 years. I do not want a refund in coins, I want my refund in trees. Purchasing new trees with coins from remaining focus was the point of this app. Very disappointed",0
"Very disappointed by the latest update. This app was really good and offered enough in the free version for frugal people, but was enticing enough to get the pro version for those who don't mind paying. Recently, they took away the majority of trees available to the free users. This is extremely disappointing and I sincerely hope they consider reversing this decision.",0
"First of all, I love the aesthetics and concept of the app -- but right now I have a major issue. I bought the $2 upgrade, my family member confirmed the purchase approval, yet it still says Complete Pending Purchase whenever go back to the upgrade option. It gives me an error when I try to restore account. Please help! I bought the app and don't know why I can't use it! I even refunded the purchase from the Play Store, but it still says Complete Pending Purchase. I contacted you with pics.",0
"I'm using this app since 2016 but now it's not even a part of its shadow. Clunky like 300 mb for what, doesn't work & majority of things landlocked in account feature or premium. Cant add own time, use their alloted time, can't it use without account like to keep everything offline like record,no reminder once done, no full-screen option, no reminder tunes. Overall, farewell. I'll use my clock's stopwatch option to keep things going. Chrome and desktop app are another letdowns. No Firefox addon.",0
"I have upgraded to pro version but find this app isn't optimized for foldable phone. I even cannot change the tag of the focus time, the tags are outside of the screen and cannot scroll down. It also doesn't work on split view, So that mean I can only use this app with the external screen. This is so inconvenient. Another issue: when my phone is in silent mood, there's no reminding sound when the focus session finish, even though I set the ringtone mood to normal. How can I know it's finished?",0
"useless app, free apps are much better. I really didn't liked üòï. I can't set short breaks, long breaks and number of pomodoros. I am really frustrated with the interface.",0
"I really like this app, it has helped me focus more while studying. I've been saving some coins for the last few days, because I wanted to buy the scarecrow (that was 600 coins) but now it's not possible anymore, unless you have a pro version. Very disappointing, now we have only a few trees available and then we'll be forced to upgrade if we want a tree that was included before.",0
"This app used to work so well, it would keep me from using any other app on my phone and decreased my overall screen time. However this new update doesn't do that at all. I can start the timer and jump into another app with no repercussion in Forest. I could have it running all the time and rack up the points no problem. Changing things up and creating a ""Deep Focus Mode"" is exceptionally redundant (and doesn't work anyways on my phone) as that's what the app did originally! Uninstalled. Bummer",0
"Very good concept. But needs stability. It keeps crashing and I have to reinstall it. I also don't get the end notification when I am in Don't disturb mode. Usually other apps have the over ride. Some feature suggestions are , mid session reminder or one minute remaining reminder. Sometimes people become anxious. :) After multiple crashes decided to move on to other apps. Also didn't get any support from the apps support team, for the paid version.",0
"I feel like the concept is excellent but the app doesn't actually execute it - unless you have the pro version. You can very easily leave the app, go on Instagram for an hour and come back to a very alive tree. The only way to prevent this is to set it to 'deep focus' which is only available if you pay for it. Having pro features is fine but not when it's literally the whole point of getting the app in the first place!?!",0
"I used this for ages, almost a couple of years, to meditate and help me sleep. Just let the phone screen lock and stop displaying and the sounds kept going. Now it turns off no matter what. For ages it was the only thing helping me sleep. Now it useless. Not even the deep focus allows it to play once the screen locks. Soo dispointed in the changes I even unistalled and re-installed to see if I'd done something wrong with permissions In response to reply, I've unistalled the app.",0
I deleted this app a long time ago today i redowloaded ot and all my data is gone. I had bought alot of trees and all my data was gone. I also bought the proversion so i also wasted money on it. Thank you very much.,0
"It used to be my favourite app, but every next update over last falf a year makes it a bit worse. I'm absolutely fine watching advs and even clicking to some, as it fare payment for using the app. One of the nice features of this app among other similar ones, was an option to exchange coins you earn by growing trees on the different type trees or flowers. Nice, easy, catchy. Buuuuut today all trees I was collecting during last year just gone, geeving me back ""coins"", which I can't spend. 1 star",0
"Awful. Had this app for years. Loved the fact that you could unlock many pretty trees, even if you didn't have the pro version. Was a great reward, a thing I looked forward to. Now every tree that isn't basic is reserved to the pro version. And of course, the trees you unlocked before this change aren't available anymore. All of this just to make a couple bucks more from literally little more than a timer. Might as well set my alarm clock from now on.",0
"Rubbish app now. I've used this for years and loved it and recommended it to lots of friends. But.. now it's been updated and all the different trees I'd worked hard for have been removed. Time to change to a better app that doesn't demotivate you. I've switched to Focus, commit - be focused with pomodoro timer. It's soooo much better & loving the way it makes you take short breaks.",0
"I used to love this app, but the latest update has just ruined it for me. Not being able to use but 4 trees is annoying and shows that to the designers the possibility of profit is way more important that user experience. Claiming that this change has taken place to ""prevent pirated software"" is neither convincing nor logical, not to mention that due to the latest update *every* single time I open the app a new pop up message explaining the change appears, even though I've already read it.",0
"Was working well but now apps are freely running even in deep focus mode. Nothing has worked so far, faqs etc and their customer support is very slow.... I m premium user",0
This app is so pathetic...this is my first review overall for any app....n i can tell u d amount of frustration it has offered me..... timer doesn't run becoz u gotta create a room with friends..you can't study alone with a timer..as soon as you pay this app becomes much more miserable with just buffering all the time....u literally don't have to waste ur money on this...leave apart the other features...when u can't try d basic ones... don't pay... don't waste your money n time....,0
"Nothing can be opened, including achievements, the store, or friends, despite the availability of the Internet and I have a professional version.... I hope the problem is resolved quickly.",0
"After I plant a tree, I'm not allowed to exit the app, exiting kills the tree. But there is a loophole I am able to minise the app and start scrolling Instagram, and in the background the tree grows violating the whole purpose of this app. I don't like this. Fix it",0
"It's completely useless unless u r willing to pay! You're not even allowed to create an account so don't even think that they'll let u use some features atleast without paying...Ik what they gonna reply, ""they need money for their start-up "".. I've read the reviews...well every phone has timer and stopwatch...no need for this app....",0
"I bought this app back when I had a normal Pixel 4a 5g, But then I transfered to a degoogled phone on which 80% of apps from this app store work perfectly well besides this one, the issue being that even though you require an ""external"" logging in order to prove your purchase, it still requires you to have google play services installed which makes absolutely 0 sense, Would be great if you guys could work on this, and if it is done please respond to this review and I will change it to a 5 STAR",0
I gave it five stars before but since the latest update I can't log in normally to my account anymore though I've paid for the pro version. It feels like they made it harder to log back in so we'll buy the pro version again but hey that's just me. They make it such a hassle just to log back in.,0
"Pretty pointless, uninstalled after a few timed sessions, doesn't seem to have an alarm when session finishes. Recommended by someone as a good Pomodoro style app, but I'll try something else.",0
"The store wasn't loading so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, figuring that that would be fine since I was logged in under my account when I did so. Upon reinstalling and signing in again all of my data is gone.",0
"I don't have any visible notification when the time is up. The support was not able to help me. This app is then useless for me. The idea of the garden is good. The rest is not very intuitive to use It seems this app emerged from very good ideas, but the product in itself seems to have been created by less talented people.",0
"I have purchased the Pro version but there's only ""GIVE UP"" button. Please have the PAUSE & RESUME buttons too, as I sometimes go to the bathroom or to the kitchen to drink water. And I also wish there was a ""to-do list"" or ""habit tracker"" type of things available in it. Then it will be a perfect app for everyone for sure.",0
I'm a pro user. App was absolutely loving until I got logged out of it. Once I was logged out and there is no way to log in again. I've even mailed my problem to the team and no one is responding. Worst experience for me!! If the team sees the msg atleast now. Kindly respond.,0
"The app is decent, but I observed a significant issue: it's quite easy to navigate away from the app while it still runs in the background. This loophole doesn't effectively aid in maintaining focus, as one can use other apps without interrupting the timer. I think there's a strong concept here, but there are areas that could benefit from further development and improvement.",0

"Nice at first, decided to purchase Pro version to make personal tags and unlock more things, cuz why not. But I have to make a separate account for it, which might not sound too bad, but it is honestly annoying/inconvenient for me. Now the shop is locked, period. Before I could at least purchase a few things, now I can't at all. And I don't really want to make an account for it, so it mostly makes me want a refund/not use the app as much :/ It is an alright time management app, though.",0
"I have used Forest for a while but had to delete it simply because one crucial feature doesn't work: notifications. I start a timer to focus, but then the timer gets stuck and doesn't notify me that the session completed. This happens around 50% of the time. I tried all the fixes for Samsung phones from Forest's own website, but still I don't get notified. To my understanding, the fault is on Samsung and how it makes apps doze off, but that doesn't change that the app doesn't function properly.",0
the pro version should be fir free,0
"It is difficult to control that. And to delete unsuccessful focus time, you should either watch ads or pay 60 ü™ôü™ô.and when i was going to start deep focus time, app required me a lot of thing and it may even use my personal information. Even after I sat, it didn't work.",0

They won around $30 to purchase this but you have to give him your credit card for the free trial. At which they are gonna charge you and you know how that usually works out. I think that the play store should start forcing these app creators to put the price of their apps downloading it for free and then having to give a credit card to even use it for several days to see if you even want it I could see say OK you get a 30 day free trial after that it locks up and you can uh buy it or not then,0

I can't believe you guys have the audacity to charge for such a simple app. And your ads are way too intrusive!,0
I used the widget of planner pro.After restart of the phone the widget on the screen becomes very transparent almost invisible.Hence i deleted the application from my phone.,0
Was gonna use it then saw you gotta pay premium for basic stuff. Glad I read reviews first and didn't make an account,0
I am really disappointed. I have tired to make an account with this app twice and it won't work. It just load forever and then tells me there is error! I ended uninstalled it twice,0
Can't even get the app to load,0
Wont let you plan anything in the weekly planner unless you pay for it Dont recommend,0
The widget on this app is inconsistent at best. Sometimes it shows events and sometimes it doesn't. I emailed a representative and they refused to reimburse me and are insisting that the reason the app doesn't show any events is because I dont have any plans.,0
Not helpful... layout is awkward and there are constant ads.,0
Charged when they said they wouldn't.,0
If you want all the normal functions you have to pay. Calendar widget needs payment. Week view needs payment. May as well use the standard calendar that comes with your phone. Oh and Ads galore prompting you to pay what u can get for free elsewhere.,0
Ive had it for several years now and before it was amazing but recently it deletes my appointments randomly. I've missed a few birthdays and appointments. It was pretty expensive for it not to work.,0

"Only had access to daily planner without paying. No weekly. No monthly. No events. No notes. An ad for the premium package popped every single time I clicked anything, including in the limited free daily planner section. If I could have given this 0/5 stars, I would have due to the advertisements for the paid features making the free features unusable.",0
This is a subscription service. It is not free.,0
Takes ages to sign in,0
"Whats happened to this app, it won't even open now, anyone else have this problem? Can the developer fix this, I have a Samsung S20 and its always worked and its my calendar so am a bit lost without it. HELP!",0
"Yet another one of these apps that's money grubby and wants you to pay for basic features such as having a task repeat. Wish devs would be transparent about their ""free"" app not really being free if you want more than the barest of the bare bones (in which case, just use the stock calendar or find a less greedy app that lets you have basic features without paying).",0
"I have the app on the table and wanted to install it on the phone, which I have on always. Same email, tells me I have to pay again for pro, which I have in the tablet. Very annoyed about it. It's the same sign in.",0
"Can't open the app. Set up account, then just goes back to the login page.",0
It's not opening after login getting forced closed,0
It keeps crashing.,0
"App doesn't open, crashes on Samsung S6 lite tab. Looks like a good app. Shame I can't use it.",0
Keep crashing,0
I am not able to open app in my Xiaomi pad 5,0
"It won't load, I've not even managed to look at more than the app icon as each time I try to open it, the app crashes. Shame as it looked really good from what I've seen. Trying to use it on Samsung galaxy S7+ tablet.",0
"Worst app, is not even aesthetic, no theme colour and worst app of all",0
Free version should include reccuring events. Otherwise why would you even bother with it?,0
All good functions behind paywall...didn't try further because the function that I wanted was behind that paywall. It does not appear that it does any better than just your Google calendar.,0
Won't let you update without the paid version. Screw that.,0
"Everything went haywire after the latest update. All my new tasks are gone and the tasks that I've deleted in 2021 came back. I really depended so much on this app as my planner for appointments, to-do list etc. Now my whole schedule is a mess and I have to rely on my memory to recall everything. Google email back up? No this app didn't do that. There's no back up. Disappointed and uninstalling!",0
"Putting as many basic features behind a paywall as you can, I see. What a waste.",0
Have to pay to try the features I want to try.,0
"Opened it once, was very glitchy, the app auto closed and now it won't open",0
Nearly ¬£20 for a yearly subscription...you having a bloody laugh! Deleted right away!,0
It doesnt work cross devices! I changed phones and the application didnt bring my tasks to the new phone. Ive been waiting for help desk to get back to me for several days and no one reached out to me,0
Wouldn't let me create an account or sign in with Google.,0
WORST app,0
Would have toved to try the app but required too much personal information to use. Uninstalled immediately since I'm not willing to give them access to literally everything.,0
"I just paid the annual subscription fee which is good until 2023. However, today I was charged $4.99 ... Why?",0
I did not like the fact that after downloading the app I was asked to upgrade before I did anything ....did not even browse thru the app completely if I'm expected to buy extras at the download....not worth it for me,0
Expensive for a basic planner not worthy,0
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.,0
This is a great planner but I'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the Pro version I am now expected to pay an annual fee!!!,0
NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,0
This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.,0
"Yet another one of these apps that's money grubby and wants you to pay for basic features such as having a task repeat. Wish devs would be transparent about their ""free"" app not really being free if you want more than the barest of the bare bones (in which case, just use the stock calendar or find a less greedy app that lets you have basic features without paying).",0
"Update BE VERY AWARE I have seen unusual activity on my phone since downloading the app. My bank has also contacted me to confirm unusual logging in Can't get the app to sound an alarm when the designated time as set. Contacted ""help"" section and was initially given script reply, i.e. will it do X then try Y. When this failed no more contact. I asked for refund as it's it fit for purpose. No return reply from then on. What is the purpose of this app if no notification of diary entry arises",0
"This app has TONS of positive reviews. Downloaded it and bought the Pro version, and it immediately started having issues and closing itself repeatedly. Asked me if I wanted to clear the cache, and I did so. Still continued to close.",0
App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.,0
"It uses your own calendar to do what your own calendar already does. It doesn't add any features that the calendar doesn't already have. It just changes the colors. It even uses your own sounds for alerts, nothing original.",0
The widget on this app is inconsistent at best. Sometimes it shows events and sometimes it doesn't. I emailed a representative and they refused to reimburse me and are insisting that the reason the app doesn't show any events is because I dont have any plans.,0
"I had a weak cell signal, app opened, immediately went to ad, couldn't close it... Couldn't play with the app, so, DELETED. Could be greatest app on earth, but when ads can't be closed (even having them at least time out would be ok)... Bye, bye.",0
"This app sucks if you dont have the Pro version. I only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task. I tried to add an event, and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me.",0
If you want all the normal functions you have to pay. Calendar widget needs payment. Week view needs payment. May as well use the standard calendar that comes with your phone. Oh and Ads galore prompting you to pay what u can get for free elsewhere.,0
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.,0
"Got this to plan my content for the next few months. Deleted the app, because I'd rather not connect my personal calendar with this one. You can't even use the app if you don't give it permission to access your other calendar, which is pretty dumb.",0
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS,0
I am a paid user for 10 months.. everything works fine n I plan to renew my subscription until 3 days ago... all my past ten months of event records were gone suddenly..and planner pro can't do anything to help to get back 10 months of event data. Totally disappointed with this app and will stop my renewal. I won use it even for free. I did contacted u guys n exchanged a few emails. Seems to me there is nothing u guys can do to help.,0
"It won't load, I've not even managed to look at more than the app icon as each time I try to open it, the app crashes. Shame as it looked really good from what I've seen. Trying to use it on Samsung galaxy S7+ tablet.",0
Will not let you use the app without syncing to device calendar when my entire reason to get an external planner app was to keep things separate. Horribly inconsiderate of how people actually want to use the service.,0
"So you just put tasks in alphabetical order instead of the order in which I need to do them depending on the time there should be the capability to change that I do not want to read my tasks in alphabetical order I want to read them in the order that I placed them on my task list I'm uninstalling this app I don't know why I keep trying to use it, it never works well.",0
"I just downloaded the app. The app is wonderful. However, the next day my card was compromised and now have 3 fraudulent transactions. I don't do a whole lot with apps and never have this happen. Caution",0
"could be better. pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time. for example i have to study during mondays, tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm. the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me. hoping for a better update.",0
"The basic account is useless, this is not a freemium app as it looks like.",0
Too many bugs in 10 minutes of use to keep. I saw so many bugs just trying to get it setup that I immediately requested a refund. Tasks that showed up twice when checking them off. Recurring task that didn't recure. I was more than willing to pay $30 for a planner that worked and had the feature i need.. Unfortunately this one didnt.,0
Cannot get it to work on my Huawei P20. I have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in. It looks like it works fine on my iPad because I can sign up and get in but on my phone I am unable to do either. I needed something that I could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone,0
"Was great at first, but a new bug makes it so that every time I unlock my phone i have to press the ‚Äúhome‚Äù button twice to be able to use my phone at all. I know that it is this app causing the problem as when I click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs, this app is always the only one shown. I will have to uninstall now because of this.",0
They won around $30 to purchase this but you have to give him your credit card for the free trial. At which they are gonna charge you and you know how that usually works out. I think that the play store should start forcing these app creators to put the price of their apps downloading it for free and then having to give a credit card to even use it for several days to see if you even want it I could see say OK you get a 30 day free trial after that it locks up and you can uh buy it or not then,0
"Terrible experience. If you forget to acknowledge a recurring task when it reminds you, it will no longer send reminders for that task. Randomly changes ""remind me when due"" selection to ""do not remind me"". In one week, with 4 tasks per day, it has failed to remind me 9 times. Absolutely useless! ETA: AFTER THE DEVELOPERS REPLY, I checked my power saving and HAD NONE ACTIVATED. DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. DO NOT BUY! ETA: Two years later (07/22), still doesn't work.",0
I uninstalled it coz its not useful for me.,0
Developer is an arrogant entitled child who has no idea where this app sits in the overall market. Avoid this garbage.,0
"7.0 update can't use old view. I don't see an option to revert to the old view, as indicated in the screenshots, and as was available in prior version 6.2. I have a lifetime license for this app. I'm not fond of the new view at all ... particularly tasks. Since the tasks utilize a system very close to the Franklin planner system, I was drawn to this app and paid for the license. Latest version is huge let down; user can't tailor. When it comes to my planner, I want to be able to customize!",0
"I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.",0
I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .,0
"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew",0
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.,0
"This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.",0
"Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me.",0
"I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.",0
"Only had access to daily planner without paying. No weekly. No monthly. No events. No notes. An ad for the premium package popped every single time I clicked anything, including in the limited free daily planner section. If I could have given this 0/5 stars, I would have due to the advertisements for the paid features making the free features unusable.",0
"Beware! Trial is Not True Trial!!! I installed the app, clicked the Start Trial button and the app charged me!! Canceled the trial and was told I would have access for the full year until my year ends! What a rip!!! Not an actual Trial and no way to request a refund!! Save yourself the stress and bypass this one!!! UPDATE - There is no Agenda View available, even when you change the calendar view in settings, it does not change the month view. Seems like the only view available.",0
"The new update changed the day format From mon- Tuesday across the screen, but it appears now it can only go mon- Thursday across the screen It has really mucked me up alot. The ONLY option I ever wanted with this app was the ability to copy/ paste events. Please please bring this is Manually typing in the shifts I do takes a huge amount of time I can't even utilise the date to date to do it as the times of the shifts change so an easy copy and paste of an event would be amazing!!",0
"Don't bother! This is a 3-day trial! The layout in the calendar space in the way everything is organized is very routine and mediocre. There is nothing that makes this app stand out from any other app. It's not that it's so bad, it's just that it's not very good either. So much better out there for free",0
"Rubbish, changed phones, no longer recognises me, lost all my info Update, they do not care, cancelled sub, want a refund, LOST all my data",0
I've used planner Pro on my old Samsung phone without any issues. I've downloaded it to my new Samsung & it does nothing but crash. I've checked available memory & there's loads available,0
"Everything went haywire after the latest update. All my new tasks are gone and the tasks that I've deleted in 2021 came back. I really depended so much on this app as my planner for appointments, to-do list etc. Now my whole schedule is a mess and I have to rely on my memory to recall everything. Google email back up? No this app didn't do that. There's no back up. Disappointed and uninstalling!",0
"I've been sooo happy with this app, best buy ever, perfect planning for the past like four years! and now the new update has completely ruined my life planning!!! I beg you to fix it asap.",0
"I use to love this app. It is the perfect organizer with great features. However for the last month+ it barely opens. I am lucky if it will actually open twice a day. The app will say not responding, opens to a black page, or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily. My life is saved into this app so I am so frustrated!!",0
"Waste of time! Don't install you have to sign in/ give your details before you can even access the app for the first time. Then it's Nothing like the pictures all its just a regular calandar, it syncs with your Google calendar that's it! it's just a monthly view can't see how to change to a week View to create a week plan. Protect your privacy and data and just don't bother with this. I deleted within 5 minutes (but couldn't see how to delete my data, feels very dodgy)",0
"I tried adding the pro for $7.99 because I thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things I was hoping for, I have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund, I have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so I just want my money back and this app gone!",0
I just bought and it looks nothing like the pictures. I wanted the exact planner ad pictured! Where are the tabs at top?,0
"You can't even make tasks repeat (i.e., water plants once a week) without paying a monthly subscription fee to this app. The free version is pathetic for planning purposes.",0
Ive had it for several years now and before it was amazing but recently it deletes my appointments randomly. I've missed a few birthdays and appointments. It was pretty expensive for it not to work.,0
"I am trying to refund it- the one thing i wanted it to do, daily repeating tasks is not working. i'm not sure if it's due to it being user unfriendly or what, but i made the rash desision to buy this.",0
I was really excited about this app but when I went to create an account it did not work. I tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work. I am very disappointed,0
Was completely useless. Would not work without access to my calendar. I already have a calendar. Obviously. Wanted a weekly planner.,0
Doesn't work offline. requires internet and information. So not personal as it is over the internet. Sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up... UNINSTALLED.,0
Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.,0
"over basic, definitely not worth 200 per year. pictures shown are not what the app looks like.",0
I used the widget of planner pro.After restart of the phone the widget on the screen becomes very transparent almost invisible.Hence i deleted the application from my phone.,0
This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.,0
I have asked 4 times for a refund of the premium paid as I could not get the app to sync on multiple devices.,0
it's simple enough to set up a task or event..but not once has it reminded me as set to. so looking for one that will.,0
I have the paid version of this app for years. Now it keeps deleting all of my recurring appointments in all of my calendars.,0
Warning - don't get logged out or you will lose everything. Customer service is incrediblt unhelpful and unresponsive.,0
I was able to add up to two weeks before the app crashed and would not open again. Don't waste your time with downloading this app.,0
"I lost all of my notes, and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so I deleted it and installed it again, then logged in and all of my stuff was gone. Please help, I need it back.",0
They are charging huge money for some okay kind of features Multi device and specially windows syncing is a big issue Click up is much better,0
Does not integrate well across multiple cross-platform devices; more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app.,0
Too Buggy. I can't add things like taking insulin daily or my weekly meds as repeaters. It doesn't work. I regret buying it. Purchasing another.,0
Would have toved to try the app but required too much personal information to use. Uninstalled immediately since I'm not willing to give them access to literally everything.,0
I did not like the fact that after downloading the app I was asked to upgrade before I did anything ....did not even browse thru the app completely if I'm expected to buy extras at the download....not worth it for me,0
"Now hold on. I paid for the ""premium version"" a couple years ago for ad-free use. Decide to update the app for once and suddenly that's gone?",0
"I didn't feel comfortable going past the disclaimer. It wants to monitor too much of my phone, but thank you anyways.",0
All good functions behind paywall...didn't try further because the function that I wanted was behind that paywall. It does not appear that it does any better than just your Google calendar.,0
This app wont let you see the events you enter unless you pay for pro. It wont let you scroll up to see your events without prompting you to pay for premium. Its useless unless you wanna pay $30 a month for something you can get for free on google maps... Cause the features are the same.,0
You are required to give access to your calendar and contacts and other bs. If I wanted to use Google calendar I would use Google calendar. I want something not linked to any of my other accounts.,0
I received a notice from planner pro this morning when I went to schedule some appts. it notifies me I cannot use the app until payment received. iI checked my bank and payment was made on 01/26/2019. I will be cancelling as unable to use.,0
"I subscribed for a year plan, and it's asking me to get a premium. I mean, I paid but can't use the premium feature, and its not even letting me log out! Trash bug.",0
"I have the app on the table and wanted to install it on the phone, which I have on always. Same email, tells me I have to pay again for pro, which I have in the tablet. Very annoyed about it. It's the same sign in.",0
I am really disappointed. I have tired to make an account with this app twice and it won't work. It just load forever and then tells me there is error! I ended uninstalled it twice,0
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks",0
Widgets are behind. It could be the next day and the Calendar widget still showing the previous day. Likewise with the Task widget it can be the day that task needs to be completed and it says that it's due tomorrow.,0
Very very very very very very bad or should I say the worst app I have ever seen. It doesn't let me sign in and even create account even if I agree every condition. I was so excited to try it after reading all the reviews but it is useless!!! üôÑüôÑüôÑü§¨,0
I loaded the app on to my Amazon Fire. It will only display horizontally and I dont have the export option even though I have the Premium subscription. I can't export my Task list either.,0
It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.,0
"Too many ads, and it doesn't automatically save your work. Also, everytime I exit, and reopen it, it brings me to a different page than I was on.",0
Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.,0
"Lmao this app is so bad. Setting events is a pain, time zones don't work, the from time and to time of an event don't work. If you trust this app for your planning. I'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting. Just use Microsoft Outlook etc and pay for it. This one is a waste of time",0
Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.,0
ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...,0
The app was working great intill today its not letting me put any new notes in to it right them out click on save and it doesn't save anything I'll give it another go tomorrow if it doesn't work then I'll be cancelling my subscription and going back to pen and paper,0
The interface is too slow....it's takes hours to add a note/task or events and review the ones already added Please fix this issue.....or I am uninstalling FIX THE LAGGING ISSUE,0
"This isn't a comment on Planner Pro, but it's a comment on Planner Plus. Since I updated my iPad to iOS 14.6, I no longer can open Planner Plus. When I click on the Planner Plus app, it now says ""Planner Plus Needs to be updated. The developer of this app needs to update it to work with this version of iOS."" I AM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER as I lost a lot of valuable info I had in Tasks in Planner Plus, which do not import into Planner Pro.",0
"Whats happened to this app, it won't even open now, anyone else have this problem? Can the developer fix this, I have a Samsung S20 and its always worked and its my calendar so am a bit lost without it. HELP!",0
It doesnt work cross devices! I changed phones and the application didnt bring my tasks to the new phone. Ive been waiting for help desk to get back to me for several days and no one reached out to me,0
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed,0
I'm sorry but no planner is ever worth paying for it every month. I'll just stick to my hard cover planners.,0
"Horrible product. Difficult to use, does not do half of what is shown. I even bought a pen for my tablet, but still is not any where as easy to use as advertised. Waste of money. I'd give it zero stars, but that is not an option.",0
Downloaded to use to plan projects but then discovered that is a premium feature with a subscription. No mention of that in thd description. Deleted immediately,0
"Genuinely disappointed :( I don't get a single notification at the time I scheduled them for. I turned off battery saver and another setting to actually get the notifications to pop up at all, but they come 3-16 minutes late on day 1. The whole purpose for an app like this is for timed notifications to keep a tighter schedule without using Google spyware. 3:03 is not 3:00. Yes, even 3 minutes can throw your entire day off with a tight enough schedule. Fix this and I'll reinstall.",0
I do no not recomend this app it would not let me take notes and it was so lagy!!!!!,0
Not able to have all tasks needed listed...,0
I found it difficult to use till I was used to it.,0
"Everytime I go to type in a task, the first word gets messed up into something other than what I typed, and now any task I add for the date selected gets changed/pushed to the next date....?",0
"Would rather try it free for like 7 days or something, than to buy just to set a recurring task.",0
I really wish it had a web version and a special area for birthday. And be a little more intuitive with more feature. It does the job but nothing attractive.,0
I really like the calendar but i'm frustrated. Why do I have to have it connected to another calendar app for me to be able to use it across multiple devices? If I wanted to use google calendar then I would simply use google calendar. Why can't I just have this one app without being connected to google? Why is what i put on this app on my tablet not visible on this app over on my phone? Without this annoyance i'd say its a great app.,0
I signed into the daily schedule and it refused to take my sign in 4 times. I dont have time for that. I uninstalled the app,0
Anytimes keeps stoping,0
Why would I pay to upgrade this when the same thing is free on my calendar without this app? I don't see a need for this.,0
"Actually i like this app, in the middle of think to switch to pro, i found bug on the widget. I placed 5x5 widget on home screen, and it become invisible after the phone restart. It still can be clicked to pop up the main app, but i can't see anything. Please fix it.",0
"Daily event and tasks just disappears. They stay on Google Calendar but in this app, it's all just gone",0
"Paid for this app, really thinking there would be more user control and options. Much better apps for free , friends!",0
I paid for the premium so I can get things repeated weekly. I tried to put something in to be repeated every week on Tuesday. It only repeated one week thats it. So I have to put it in manually for every tue. There should be a way to type in once and then set a repeat so it will auto show every Tuesday. I feel like I wasted my money now. I set repeat to every 7 days it does not work.,0
Used the pro version for a couple months as it seemed like a good app. Randomly deletes and duplicates events and unable to customise when events are recurring. If they aren't one day after another you have to manually enter them all. Uninstalled.,0
They are always changing Something after updates. And it isn't always functional like used to be,0
The widget stops working way to much.,0
"It makes auto-copies of tasks. When you delete them, keep showing them again and again. Very annoying.",0
"This new planner pro for which I paid for life is poorer than the previous version. I take ages to open, does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward. Very bad.",0
"I downloaded this app on my photo and it works great! But I just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though I used the same account, none of my events were there. It didnt sync right. I tried to restart, nothing. This app is good, just not for multiple devices.",0
"This app was fine for years and then became extremely laggy. It also started duplicating weekly tasks to the point that I would have to delete five or six versions of a task in order to return it to one weekly. Often the delete or complete options have to be used multiple times on the same task before it actually disappears. I have basically stopped using it except as a calendar, but it's so slow it's not even efficient to be used for that.",0
Nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with Google calendar and not cross platform. Certainly cannot do $15/yr.,0
"suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared, synchronization has some issues",0
"Seems like it would fit my needs, but for some reason I can't get the events to show up on the Monthly Calander. I tried multiple times but never worked. Very frustrating as this is hugely important for me in order to stay organized.",0
This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!,0
"I'm a highly scattered person but is sensitive to too much details so I need a planner that really looks neat but has enough features like this so big thumbs up for the UI. EDIT: have to pay for most of the features so, I'll go find a better app.",0
Looks easy but it doesnt notify me. I tried the 3 day trial but on the first day it failed to notify me. Not even a notification. I setup the alarm and time correctly. Its a no no for me,0
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app,0
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.,0
It would be a 5* review if it weren't yearly payment. Put it a one time payment and I'll be the first one to buy it. This really ruined it for me.,0
looool its a calendar that need a calendar local or google lol i. dont want to mess my local calendar looool. so its not working without a calendar i wanted seperater calendar from my local or google. one buy this is useless app,0
Why is there no way to view notes and pictures without being in edit mode?,0

Best planner app I've found so far but I HATE that you have to pay yearly. I'd rather just buy it one time.,0
"Tried to see if past events can be searched more than 1 yr back (what Google unfortunately does now) , but it doesn't .. so it is rubbish to me..can't beat Google calendar or outlook..the calendars you get for free with your email, this one you need to pay to get no adds and still isn't that much better.",0
Your screenshots are misleading üòê,0
"It requests permission in the beginning for too many things,not comfortable with that. At least their upfront about it.",0
I love this app but recently it asked me a multiple times to get the Premium pack witch I then needed to pay for now I can not even do the Baciss without having to get the Premium pack.,0
"I hope you make the widget able to be smaller, especially the tasks one ,also i'll love it if you made the time able to show up with the task",0
I paid premium and liked it at first but it keeps deleting my events. Sometimes it deletes some of them but leaves the rest up. Super annoying.,0
I want to purchase the app but the options are not working.,0
I m new users,0
Can't login please do resolve After sign-in the app is crashing and exiting,0
Can't reorder subtasks and task list doesn't show task start times :(,0
"Not as Decribed at ALL. iOS & Android does work or sync together. The app doesn't sync on either side (meaning if you have all Android/Apple devices, they still won't sync w/ each other.) You will have separate task lists on ALL your mobile devices. E-mailing support is pointless. Going through my bank to get my money refunded.",0
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.,0
It's Google calendar with different color scheme,0
Loved this app until I updated updated it. Gibberish on every day now. It is terrible. Like this on my phone and tablet!!!!! How do I fix. I depend on this planner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Uninstalled when I saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data, I never will.",0
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes,0
I just installed this app and it's always on landscape view. Please fix this soon. Thank you!,0
It's just a skin for Google calendar.,0
When my phone is in tablet mode (android 7) the app will not display in portrait mode. It defaults to landscape mode.  Pls fix and I'll change my review.,0
It's ok. The free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone.,0
"With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.",0
"I don't want make an account before trying out the app! Give us a week trial before making us sign up, please.",0
Would like questions answered I email my questions for answers & I give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me. This is very disappointing especially when I bought this app. Very poor for business kevin,0
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping,0
Didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode.  I think I should be able to choose whether I need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option. I may end up using it this is only the second app that I have tried for organizing by used to be hand & ink written notebooks.,0
Ads. Just too many.,0
"I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.",0
"This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.",0
"i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another. however, i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with. i had to do it like 10 times :/ but still like the app tho. i hope that bug will be fixed sooner.",0
UI atrocious! Nothing fits.,0
"App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.",0
"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017‚Äù - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".",0
"I like the app, but for the past day I haven't got any notifications.",0
This app is not good if you don't buy the subscription.,0
The app worked fine for awhile but all the events I added were simply gone this morning. This was a frustrating experience.,0
"Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell.",0
"Ver y often the application does not open, you sen question and ask what is happening, and you get No replied,, Roger J Sanchez from Miami",0
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.",0
"I paid for the subscription but can not use the recurring function. I tried 
to make a task for monthly use and it does not show up on the other months 
ahead.",0
"Not very intuitive. I couldn't find a way to switch between week, day, or month views.",0
notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks,0
"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund.",0
it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes.,0
Please fix the widget. It doesn't automatically update the day. It always shows yesterdays' date. Constantly having to remove and install widget.,0
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...,0
"DO NOT PAY FOR UPGRADE!! If you upgrade it just messes the app up. I have to manually change days every morning now. If it weren't for that, it'd be great. Please fix.",0
I was told to install Planner Pro instead of Planner Plus (which was what I already used) in order for my cell phone & iPad to sync. I have had at least 5 emails back & forth with the contact person but I still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed. I guess I will have to go back to my Google calendar. I love the Planner Plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and iPad.,0
"Eh. it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do. I liked using the month widget until it just decided, on Jan 29, that the month of February no loger existed. I tried to look ahead to the month of Feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron Jan to March. The only way to view Feb in the widget was to change the date to Feb in my phone. just went back to my phone's calendar app. Uninstalling.",0
after reinstall data not recover while take backup Google Drive,0
"The interface is great and I love it overall; however, I'm giving it two Stars because it won't synchronize between my Samsung phone and Ipad, despite being the same account information for each.

"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.",0
"Not what I was looking for, I saw there was a time it would remind me I 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked",0
"Loved it...until the projects feature was going to cost me a yearly fee. 
Honestly, I wanted to try it and see if it works for me so you lost me when 
you made the features I wanted cost.",0

crock. I'll find another app üëã",0

too much. I have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks.",0
Too Buggy. I can't add things like taking insulin daily or my weekly meds as repeaters. It doesn't work. I regret buying it. Purchasing another.,0
Ads. Just too many.,0

I paid for the premium so I can get things repeated weekly. I tried to put something in to be repeated every week on Tuesday. It only repeated one week thats it.

"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund.",0
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.",0
"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.",0
"Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell.",0
"This app was AMAZING when I first started using it. Now it duplicates tasks 
too much. I have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks.",0
"I paid for the subscription but can not use the recurring function. I tried 
to make a task for monthly use and it does not show up on the other months 
ahead.",0
"Won't let me use/access weekly view unless I pay $7.99 for the year. What a 
crock. I'll find another app üëã",0
"Uninstalled when I saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data, I never will.",0
"I love this app. I've used it for years now, and it is great for keeping track of art project ideas, tasks around the house, and honey-do stuff. But, I bought a new phone because my old one was almost 7 years old and the battery wasn't holding a charge anymore. Unbeknownst to me, the massive list collection I've created CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED to my new phone unless I pay for the premium version. That may be the prerogative of the developer, but that's pretty low, in my opinion.",0
"Initially, I was really impressed with the features, particularly the ability to pause damage, until I realized pausing damage makes the game almost completely unplayable. You can't do damage, but still take damage from party member's missed dailies. The interface also has text contrast issues. Aside from being inaccessible, the penalty for death is harsh. It's a good idea but really poorly executed.",0
"I really wanted to love this app. It looks amazing & has so much potential. However, the app does not sync to your timezone. My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :(",0
"Allows me to track dailies, but doesn't connect them to habits. I would expect that completing your dailies translates into building the desire habit. The tool gives no option to associate the 2 and you cannot see your performance history, so it's unclear which I should be focusing on.",0
"If I'd rated this a year ago, it would have been a 5-star review, but the removal of the guilds has taken away the main reason I started using it in the first place. It is not only the ""gamified"" factor that encourages me to be more organized, it is also the feedback from other users that I received in the various guilds. In the FAQ regarding the change the increased use of Parties was cited as a major reason, but I can only be part of one party, and I received needed feedback from 3+ guilds.",0
"It's really disappointing that there isn't any offline mode for the app in 2023. But, if y'all really are developing an offline mode currently, then please make Habits and Dailies available in offline mode ASAP. I badly need the positive feedback loop this app provides in my study grind for SHS and College. Thanksss and bless the team.",0
"The app works but you can easily cheat, like I was able to click on a task multiple times to get leveled up faster which is not encouraging,also u can only choose daily, weekly or monthly, but the activity I had was a Halloween one and even if it was a weekly activity u can't choose which days, I would prefer like a calender feature, also the star ranking I would prefer to be AI generated based on a personality questionnaire, if we don't agree we should be able to change it, this should be added",0
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone...",0
"I really liked this app: the UI is convenient, like the separation of goals, dailies and tasks, and so on. But... it constantly is losing some data, so I can't trust it: a checked daily task becomes unchecked on next app start, the habbit i thought i traced for 3 days suddenly giving me ""1 day streak"" badge... Too bad.",0
"This app is a great concept, and helped me a lot when I was first beginning to use it, but now the near constant bugs and errors make actually using the app near impossible to do. It feels like the past couple of months the app has gotten much worse, as frequently I have to restart to fix the numberous problems that exist.",0
"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much. Also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want? And a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time, and it's not fun enough.",0
"It is a great app, but somehow, in my phone with WiFi connection, a lot of buffer appearing when I want to change the task or create a new one. Because of that, it become messy; I did a task twice, or my task is not saved properly. I check my internet, but that's not a the problem... What a shame... :(",0
Glitchy AF. I used this year's ago and it was wonderful I downloaded it again and I'm losing health faster than I can gain it because I'm marking things of as I completed as I go but it's still asking me the next day if I did any of those things. So I can either say I did them twice or lose health for not doing them at all and sometimes when I open it at night it has changed to the next day already despite it not being after midnight so I can't mark off things I've done accurately,0
"latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day.frustrating to use.sometimes it won't save,will just have a loading loop.Some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on Monday or the date format ,doesn't keep track of activity data correctly . Please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance! was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable & less temperamental?",0
the idea and the design is great but this app should not require internet for finishing tasks or for creating new ones. it makes it really inconvenient to use in day to day life,0
I honestly did not find it very motivating and it was also pretty boring.,0
"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support.",0
"Dear Habitica, This app is currently impossible for me to use. There is no save OR delete button for editing habits. I checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem. Please, please, please fix this. I will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring. The editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character. Give users a blank sheet and let THEM apply changes.",0
"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always...",0
I can't play cues of my account I logged in and it kicked me out if my account could possibly be looked at that would nice I had so much progress on it,0
"This app has been great until it hasn't been, I noticed a couple weeks ago that the response time on the app was reduced. I figured it might be just because I have a lot of tasks that I've entered into the app slowing it down client side. That was until the servers crashed for more than 24 hours which made all of my *daily* habit tracking inaccessible. Continuous usability is fundamentally necessary for this kind of app. Even now that the server is back they are seriously struggling",0
I could not understand how this works at all and now I'm very frustrated. Why do most app developers neglect to introduce their apps? Update: it's been more than a week and I have no idea how this works. Looks like I'm gonna have to uninstall and keep looking. No help whatsoever.,0
"the concept is really good. the execution fell short, the ui is unintuitive and janky, it's usable but really ugly and unresponsive. as someone who plays mobile games the lag is frankly unbearable. much as the devs want to tailor to adults, it's just not screaming ""game"" enough, the graphics need to be reworked into something more indie/cartoony, it's just not very stylistic or visually appealing. rewards could be made more visually stimulating, onboaring also needs to improve",0
"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...",0
"Like the desktop version and concept. But the app is just broken. Everyday when I load it up all my TODOs, Habits, etc. show up as empty and I have to close and re-open the app to see them. This is just a critical issue that ruins the whole experience.",0
"The app was in Spanish, switched the language to English but all the tasks stay in Spanish:(",0
"Broken. Can't sign up with Google (does nothing, no error). Have to mash 10x or more on next buttons just trying to make avatar. Similar touch issues trying to navigate random parts of the app, idk maybe they aren't even buttons. Never had these kinds of problems anywhere, sucks cause it looked fun, but i just can't use it. Galaxy A53",0
"Great idea, however, needs work on the execution. I'd like to see more inclusive avatars because when I went to create mine I didn't feel represented. App is confusing and just needs a better system. When adding habits it wasn't easy to delete premade ones. App just needs some fine tuning",0
"It would be the best app if it allowed you to do custom weapons and bosses so you can create your own economy, it's very hard to price tasks efficiently unless you dont fight bosses or buy anything, which is refusing to use half of the app.",0
"Wait, you removed Guilds and Challenges? I'm not gonna regurgitate what other reviews are saying, but I can't fathom the logic there. I haven't used the app in a while, but just knowing this is enough for me to dock a lot of points off my old review, which appears to be lost to time. I hear something about Membership now restricting features that free players used to have, too? I know money is important, but... I didn't think you guys would go this route.",0
"Cute app but... 10 years or more in the making and you still can't configure a minimum of a habit per week? I mean... Is this REALLY a habit tracker at all?? I'm leaving this review here for the third time I try to come back here, so I can recall why I left it the first time. EDIT: having a fan-made wiki still doesn't help that there's a feature request taking dust for 10 years in the app's GitHub repo. Habits don't allow, for instance, to set ""do it 4 days a week or fail"".",0
"Doesn't really work for me. Gamification features detract from what I really need, and don't really motivate me. I'm looking for some other features like timers, scheduling in time blocks, assistance with subtasks and focusing on the first one, etc.",0
"This app has been very good to me and has helped me a lot with remembering to do things. My issue though is that the servers have been down for a while, making it impossible to check things off. I cannot recommend an app that requires servers to run, but cant keep those servers stable enough.",0
"Two bugs right at the beginning of registration. First two images didn't load on the three slides intro, then when registering my info, it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and I couldn't make an avatar. Not a good first impression. Just deleted my account thru the website.",0
"Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.",0
"I LOVE the idea of this, but it doesn't seem to be well done. The only thing you can set up are daily tasks in a list form. There is no sort of calendar overview (No weekly or monthly view to get any idea of what my schedule should look like). I do hope they develop this into something amazing.",0
"Interesting concept, but execution is awful. Achievements were not working on my phone, neither were the counters, the dailies, the notifications i recurved while in the app and it constantly asked me to refresh the session because it was out of date (refreshing never worked.) Hopefully the developers will spend some more time testing the app before future releases, but for now I'm uninstalling.",0
I love the idea but it's not working on my Samsung S10e. Like the main screen is just purple when I first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options. I'll happily try again once bugs are worked out. Keep us posted!,0
"The habit counter is always resetting itself, so annoying as practically I am the one who's keeping track of my habits... What do I need the app for if it can't even keep track of my habits? Also, the reminders are broken... Sometimes the app just won't send any notification to my phone, also very annoying.",0
"9/3/23 update: Unfortunately the app has become a lot less useful to me with the social elements removed. I was using the Guilds function to encourage me to check the app and stay accountable. Without that aspect I'm forgetting to open the app at all and my tasks keep not getting done. I have a paid subscription because it's been such a helpful tool for me but at this point it's indistinguishable from any other habit tracker, which makes its frequent crashing less tolerable. Can't recommend. :(",0
I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.,0
"Interesting concept, but the reward tiers are way too steep for beginners. You have to be using this app either constantly, or for a long time, in order to gain decent ""rewards."" Uninstalling, it's just taking up space on my phone at this point and I'm not really motivated to use it.",0
"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!",0
"Guilds was a top feature of this app, which has been recently cut. Making it subscriber only, incentivising in-app currency, or at the very least giving 1-2 months heads-up before deletion would've been courteous towards the audience. Instead we've witnessed a haphazard 1-week process, which speaks incompetence. It's still a nice app, but management buried its potential I hope it can recover some day",0
"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",0
"I much prefer other organizational/self-care apps to this one. Using negative punishment in tandem with positive reinforcement is a major turnoff, and it feels like I gain no real reward. I deal with that enough in my day-to-day. I also know that I will *almost always* end up skipping taks, and no in-game consequence will help me with that. I want to be rewarded for the stuff I *do* get done, not punished for the stuff I didn't have room or time to finish. Highly anxiety-inducing.",0
"Server connection lost"" message keeps appearing. Now it's sticking around for more than 24 hours, affecting logging in at all. App itself is good, needs options to add things to list and mark them off but not have them be erased when the task date comes back round for weekly or every other day items.",0
"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.",0
"The app is cute and a fun idea but i have had no success from gameifying my life. If it doesn't help build habits, what's the point? I would focus on better methods than trying to trick your dopamine-starved brain into doing boring or unpleasant tasks easily. It doesn't seem to work for very long once the novelty wears off. ü§∑",0
"When I downloaded the app it felt cute and it got me hooked as I enjoy gaming and leveling up would be a fun experience. At the begining I had put all my tasks in the app in the To-do section and felt good to check them off and get rewards for it. But after about a month I saw some tasks were now red, then my health was less than half and then I kept dying every day and went from lvl 7 to lvl 3 and I had no idea why. The To-do list entries have no due date so why do they do damage?",0
"App is so complicated that there's no simple way to check off a ""to do."" There's just too much going on in it, so it's frustrating. I also didn't get help from support. No help, for me, = instant removal of any app.",0
"I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable",0
"I deleted my account and made a new one, but by some reason my data restored anyways and since then I've been having a pretty annoying experience with the app, habits reset randomly during the day, it won't let me add points and the app freezes, i can't edit my habits whenever i do it goes back the way it was before, the app is running slow and buggy, I'm uninstalling and creating a new account but this was pretty annoying.",0
"The UI is unintuitive and the game guide is terrible. I finally hit level 10, clicked select class on the pop-up and it vanished. There's no other place in the app to select class so I'm super bummed. The stats page has stats to select but not class and it doesn't even indicate what class you are. I'd give this app 4 stars if it wasn't for this.",0
"I loved the concept until the app started crashing. It doesn't work on iOS or Android, either. When I had tried everything else I could do to fix the problem, I uninstalled and reinstalled it. The app still didn't work. I've only managed to use it on PC, where I originally started using it. Something is wrong with the app, it shouldn't be doing this.",0
"*Just discovered this app doesn't work offline so you can't track anything or update it on vacation, traveling, etc. I'm really enjoying this app for helping me to keep track of some nutritional and health habits. However I can't figure out how to set goals that have to happen a certain number of times per week. It only lets you pick specific days. How do I do this? Like something has to happen only three times a week and it doesn't matter which days.",0
"1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review.",0
The user experience is terrible. I just couldn't figure out how to get a daily habit going. Never got a reminder after I created a task a month or more ago. I may have not set it up correctly but that's the user experience problem. It's not intuitive at all. I'm willing to try it again if the design and ux changes and it becomes more intuitive,0
"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",0
"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.",0
"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",0
"This app was working so well when I first started using it, but nowadays it's so glitchy it's almost unusable. The guilds and the tavern were two features i really loved and now that they've been removed, finding new party members is almost impossible. I have done the hard restart for the app, my network, and my phone, checked for updates, cleared cache data, everything. It's just too glitchy to be worth the time anymore.",0
"Keeps telling me server lost....I love this app, and it's been helping me so much to stay on tasks and get things done, which is so hard when you have ADHD. Yesterday, it started telling me ""server lost"", but my wifi and cell service is working perfectly. Really upset that I can't track my productivity right now and hoping it won't mess up my ""health"".",0
"I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints.",0
Notifications not working. I have notifications turned on in my phone and the app. However I'm not receiving any notifications until I actually open the app up to check it. Then I'll get pinged with a lot of notifications at once which can get very overwhelming. It makes it difficult when I really need the notification to go off at a certain time like for medications. Otherwise the app would be great so far.,0
"Just started and so far it's cute but there is an issue for when notifications go off. I set a certain date but it starts too early, the next day, instead of two weeks later, when I set the date for. So it's not really a reminder because I have to keep checking. Also the difference between colors and ""habits"" & ""daily"" is unclear. Sometimes it's purple, sometimes yellow.. doesn't make sense. June 4 I'm sure there's some trouble with understanding here. Response doesn't solve issue.",0
"If you're looking for a to do list or a way to schedule your day this works fine, but as an RPG game type way of doing that its lacking. Almost everything costs gems, which can only be bought or won extremely rarely in competitions, including quests, most pets, all food items for pets, etc. There's not much you can do RPG wise for free in this app, so if thats what you're wanting, I wouldn't bother unless you're willing to pay for those features over and over again.",0
"I really liked this app in the beginning but I don't want to group up with people for quests. It was a great app for keeping track of goals, tasks and long term goals but it was super discouraging to keep getting demoted and losing currency. I wish there was a version that would let me freeze xp so that I can use the app without having to group with other people",0
"It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels.",0
"This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help...",0
"Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating.",0
"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it.",0
"It might be useful if it could integrate with Google Calendar and Tasks. Without an intuitive way to see repeating tasks, it's really cumbersome to manage. Some of the choices are hard to explain. There's Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos... But they're all Tasks? Habits can't be scheduled or have reminders, and To-Dos can't repeat, but Dailies can be scheduled daily/weekly/whatever? The Dailies button has a calendar icon, but there's no calendar? Cool concept, though.",0
"I've been using this off and on for the past five or six years. I'd say it was successful, but I think the social aspect (mostly guilds with challenges) was the most motivating part. Now, with them gone, it's kind of...boring and lonely. It's way too clunky and a resource hog for a productivity website/app and I only stick around because for some reason I feel like it's a waste to let all the things I've collected (imaginary items made of pixels üôÑ) over the years go.",0
"Need Wifi/Data for it. I get that you can play with your friends, but it would be nice if I could use it without wifi for data anyway. I have a limited ammout of data and brain memory. So by the time I get home after all day I've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute. Only gave this an extra star because I love the 8 Bit art.",0
used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.,0
"It does so many things well, but is lacking in several crucial aspects. On mobile, we're still not able to check off items in lists after completing them!!! Such a basic function missing is baffling to me, particularly seeing how every day there's new announcements of cosmetics and events that are completely irrelevant to what I assume is the intended purpose of the app.",0
"Actually I think so this app is a time consumer, all the habit, task and dailies stuff is fine but pets, equipments, & stuffs like those wastes my time. After all it's build like a game it there's to consume your time while making you think you did something productive today, instead I am using an app called MDF it's the best app one can try give it a shoot and you will be satisfied, point to point, daily streak, tasks, quest, motivation to quit addiction specifically corn addiction & Much More!",0
"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is ¬£47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is ¬£60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.",0
"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",0
"Got app specifically to share chore assignments with my spouse, but I have to subscribe for $9 (+$3 for each member), and the feature is buried in the desktop/browser version and doesn't appear in the app?? So what's the point of parties in the free version?Per the wiki the feature is still in development, but this isn't explained in the app/on the site. Very frustrated. And I don't mind subscribing, but the cost seems steep to unlock this feature. Interface on mobile browser isn't great either.",0
"My review was five stars until recent changes took away the Tavern. I'd been a subscriber for nearly a year and a half and played this game with friends in other countries. But without the tavern option, it became unplayable for our group of disabled friends who can't always do their daily tasks. The new pause damage option seems extremely buggy and even when paused, I took enough damage to reduce me to zero. I lost all my gold, a level in experience, and some gear. Not worth it anymore.",0
"I honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything. Before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often (such as the days of the week) you do each task was confusing. I would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them. Over all, too much work for its worth. Loved the idea though, it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items",0
"I fell in love with this app and I really want to rate it higher. It is easily the best Habit app I've ever used. But there are 2 big issues I have with it which is stopping me from doing so. 1st is the lack of an offline mode, making it difficult for me to use and keep up to date with my goals and tasks, this NEEDS to be addressed. 2nd is a nitpick, but the group feature which would be great for families is locked behind a monthly paywall. I would gladly pay if it was a one time fee.",0
"I think the app is cute, and it is a good app to track tasks and to do's. My problem with it is that I find the ""game"" part sorely lacking. I don't see the point of levelling up in it. The only fights that ever happen are boss fights that you can mostly buy by paying crystals, which are behind paywalls. I imagine that if you play with friends, it moves a bit faster.",0
"I used this app a long time ago and wanted to reset my account, it did not work. I then decided to try deleting my account and try again, it loaded back up the old account. I want to give this app another shot but it quite literally won't let me :(",0
"Great idea but I found the execution didn't work well for me. Layout and everything is pretty good, sometimes the game was a bit slow though and I would check things off and there wasn't a way to undo. You could manually change it but it wouldn't change the exp you gained or health lost. I also found the amount of exp earned was not enough to make me want to complete tasks, and I had a lot of daily, weekly, and even monthly ones set. Unfortunate",0
"Laggy and unresponsive in my few minutes experience. Wanted to use it for group tasks, but you can't set reminders for the whole group. Also, the interface to get the party/challenges portion of the app is not intuitive.",0
"I do like habitica however I've been struggling with tasks updating. It takes times to update, get ves me server error alot. I've been trying to leave the party for 2 days now and it refuses to let me leave. I believe I am going to uninstall it and search for a simpler app that works better.",0
"Overall good app with good idea but has a few major problems. Dailies not resetting(making that portion of the app useless) and overall rigid customizability, on top of being able to check of dailies that shouldn't even appear for that day. Great idea that still needs some work",0
"I find it less than clear how you use many of the features. The ""game-ification"" is lost on me. I wish there were an easy way to see a chart or record of what I have done.",0
"It would be the best app if it allowed you to do custom weapons and bosses so you can create your own economy, it's very hard to price tasks efficiently unless you dont fight bosses or buy anything, which is refusing to use half of the app.",0
"Love the idea and making tasks but the notifications don't work no matter what I do and I got this to stay on top of tasks if notifications don't work kind of useless, I've visited a lot of form its a common issue (android)",0
"The idea is ncie but I agree - the app is super buggy. Got a stuck notification that won't go away, and the customization page and inventory page are bugged too.",0
"I don't get why you have to be connected to the internet to use this app, Why not let users use the app offline and when they have internet connection the app updates the information, There can be alot of issues with bieng have to online to use this app especially a to do app, There can be connection issues, server issues and you are in a hurry to check a task and than wolloah, the app is not working due to connection Please just change this, I don get why you thought this was a good idea",0
"App is so complicated that there's no simple way to check off a ""to do."" There's just too much going on in it, so it's frustrating. I also didn't get help from support. No help, for me, = instant removal of any app.",0
"Got this to help with some of the habits and daily tasks, but the groups feature set is broken. Once the feature I'm paying for is fixed, I'll consider changing the review. I am paying for groups. Not parties.",0
There is absolutely NO reason for a To-Do app NOT to have an offline mode in these times. No reason!!! So why must I have an internet connection ALWAYS? Why can't the app just store my selections OFFLINE and reconnect with the server later when I'm online again?? Absolutely ridiculous.,0
Seems like an interesting app to achieve goals. I can't set more than a single reminder as a daily reminder. I thought I would be able to do a reminder with each task or goal. For me I want to schedule three reminders per day,0
I love this app with the major exception of it constantly losing track of the server making keeping track of my to do list more trouble. I have a good supportive community I'm involved with so I'm sticking with it but this issue should have been fixed ages ago and doesn't seem to be on THEIR to do list.,0
"I've been subscribed to this app for a few years, and at first it was really helpful. They have actually done away with features- like a ""pause"" button for when you're out of town or sick, now you just get penalized or lie, which defeats the purpose of the app. Constant server connection issues, the social aspect is dead, no new content aside from a handful of cosmetic stuff with no actual incentive to buy it... I won't new my sub after this year ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0
"I find it less than clear how you use many of the features. The ""game-ification"" is lost on me. I wish there were an easy way to see a chart or record of what I have done.",0
Well it's just not for me. It's nice and all but too much hassle for my minimalist lifestyle.,0
O don't feel rewarded that much,0
"This app is a great concept, and helped me a lot when I was first beginning to use it, but now the near constant bugs and errors make actually using the app near impossible to do. It feels like the past couple of months the app has gotten much worse, as frequently I have to restart to fix the numberous problems that exist.",0
"No offline mode, which becomes pretty significant if for example the server connection has been down for 6+hours and the company doesn't bother to update users as to why. For example.",0
"'Server connection lost' I can't load my server. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and restarting my phone. I can't even log in now, it just says 'server connection lost'",0
I love the concept. Unfortunately for me personally my habit of using this app is dwindling. Also the server seems to struggle making things laggy and frustrating. And my internet connection is good and so is my phone.,0
"Server connection lost"" message keeps appearing. Now it's sticking around for more than 24 hours, affecting logging in at all. App itself is good, needs options to add things to list and mark them off but not have them be erased when the task date comes back round for weekly or every other day items.",0
"This app has been very good to me and has helped me a lot with remembering to do things. My issue though is that the servers have been down for a while, making it impossible to check things off. I cannot recommend an app that requires servers to run, but cant keep those servers stable enough.",0
"Keeps telling me server lost....I love this app, and it's been helping me so much to stay on tasks and get things done, which is so hard when you have ADHD. Yesterday, it started telling me ""server lost"", but my wifi and cell service is working perfectly. Really upset that I can't track my productivity right now and hoping it won't mess up my ""health"".",0
Server keeps disconnecting,0
"Cute app but... 10 years or more in the making and you still can't configure a minimum of a habit per week? I mean... Is this REALLY a habit tracker at all?? I'm leaving this review here for the third time I try to come back here, so I can recall why I left it the first time. EDIT: having a fan-made wiki still doesn't help that there's a feature request taking dust for 10 years in the app's GitHub repo. Habits don't allow, for instance, to set ""do it 4 days a week or fail"".",0
They downgraded their servers and removed guilds and now the game feels dead and I'm getting frequent connection issues. It was once good.,0
"Why so many server connection issues? Why is this not local? I understand you're experiencing service issues, that's fine, I'd just recommend a future update that stores locally then server syncs. Odd that I am I unable to track anything just because there are server side issues",0
"They give data to third parties, making me suspect this is fancy, legal spyware. Also, the server has been down for 24 hours, so the app has been useless for 24 hours. :/",0
This app is a very productive app and fun tho there's a big problem. It's very buggy. My sever has got disconnected since like the last 2 days and i got logged out and idk im not able to even log in again. If these bugs get fixed the app will be so so much better. Also it glitches a lot while using it.,0
"This app has been great until it hasn't been, I noticed a couple weeks ago that the response time on the app was reduced. I figured it might be just because I have a lot of tasks that I've entered into the app slowing it down client side. That was until the servers crashed for more than 24 hours which made all of my *daily* habit tracking inaccessible. Continuous usability is fundamentally necessary for this kind of app. Even now that the server is back they are seriously struggling",0
"Wait, you removed Guilds and Challenges? I'm not gonna regurgitate what other reviews are saying, but I can't fathom the logic there. I haven't used the app in a while, but just knowing this is enough for me to dock a lot of points off my old review, which appears to be lost to time. I hear something about Membership now restricting features that free players used to have, too? I know money is important, but... I didn't think you guys would go this route.",0
"It was interesting and fun to use. But it's steadily becoming unstable. ""Server connection lost"" is the new life here. Even on first load of the day. I don't care how you respond to this. Your app just isn't staying connected for me anymore.",0
Alot of bugs,0
"I've been using this off and on for the past five or six years. I'd say it was successful, but I think the social aspect (mostly guilds with challenges) was the most motivating part. Now, with them gone, it's kind of...boring and lonely. It's way too clunky and a resource hog for a productivity website/app and I only stick around because for some reason I feel like it's a waste to let all the things I've collected (imaginary items made of pixels üôÑ) over the years go.",0
"great idea but this app doesn't work half the time. server connection cuts out, it's out of sync after every task, and when i die there's no pop up to revive me so i have to manually add health back.",0
"This app was working so well when I first started using it, but nowadays it's so glitchy it's almost unusable. The guilds and the tavern were two features i really loved and now that they've been removed, finding new party members is almost impossible. I have done the hard restart for the app, my network, and my phone, checked for updates, cleared cache data, everything. It's just too glitchy to be worth the time anymore.",0
"Compares to 4 years ago, this app got worse. I tried it before and it was fun, simple. But functional. Now it is a bloated mess a.d you have less freedom to change your own things. You also have to sign up for an account which is absolute stupidity",0
The server connection is lost every time Please get more server space and better servers Honestly just put ads or something and fix it somehow,0
Cannot create a task with a set amount of points and a reward wirh the same currency,0
"Doesn't really work for me. Gamification features detract from what I really need, and don't really motivate me. I'm looking for some other features like timers, scheduling in time blocks, assistance with subtasks and focusing on the first one, etc.",0
Re-enables notifications every time it updates. Uninstalled for being annoying,0
"The task part is pretty meh, no notifications for reminders (which seem to do... nothing?), and getting reprimanded for missing tasks doesn't feel connected enough to encourage getting your tasks done. I will say, however, that the rpg side isn't bad, in fact it's enjoyable.",0
[Update]Good app but needs a lot of improvement in UI. There are many information i am not able to find out. And even the buttons + and - are confusing after i created the tasks. I give up there are so many bugs. Uninstalled after resetting account,0
"*Just discovered this app doesn't work offline so you can't track anything or update it on vacation, traveling, etc. I'm really enjoying this app for helping me to keep track of some nutritional and health habits. However I can't figure out how to set goals that have to happen a certain number of times per week. It only lets you pick specific days. How do I do this? Like something has to happen only three times a week and it doesn't matter which days.",0
"Fun idea, but super disappointing functionality. I don't get most of the notifications I'm supposed to, and those I do receive show up at seemingly random times.",0
I liked this app very much at first! But after some time this app lags too much and it has too many bugs. I can't click any buttons and the screen also doesn't work whenever I use this app!!,0
"I think the app is cute, and it is a good app to track tasks and to do's. My problem with it is that I find the ""game"" part sorely lacking. I don't see the point of levelling up in it. The only fights that ever happen are boss fights that you can mostly buy by paying crystals, which are behind paywalls. I imagine that if you play with friends, it moves a bit faster.",0
Notifications not working. I have notifications turned on in my phone and the app. However I'm not receiving any notifications until I actually open the app up to check it. Then I'll get pinged with a lot of notifications at once which can get very overwhelming. It makes it difficult when I really need the notification to go off at a certain time like for medications. Otherwise the app would be great so far.,0
"-1 the bugs so disturbing, -1 bored, no something for mood boost, just so so, -1 nothing happen, just upgrade character but, i don't know what can we do with char",0
"Will not work offline at all, It needs a constant internet connection so it can spy on you. I believe paying money for gems in app should count as a negative habit and damage your avatars health like any other bad habit does. This app seemed like a neat idea but the execution is very disappointing. I do not recommend.",0
"the concept is really good. the execution fell short, the ui is unintuitive and janky, it's usable but really ugly and unresponsive. as someone who plays mobile games the lag is frankly unbearable. much as the devs want to tailor to adults, it's just not screaming ""game"" enough, the graphics need to be reworked into something more indie/cartoony, it's just not very stylistic or visually appealing. rewards could be made more visually stimulating, onboaring also needs to improve",0
Concept,0
Not really grabbing me!,0
It freezes on main screen when loading up,0
"If you're looking for a to do list or a way to schedule your day this works fine, but as an RPG game type way of doing that its lacking. Almost everything costs gems, which can only be bought or won extremely rarely in competitions, including quests, most pets, all food items for pets, etc. There's not much you can do RPG wise for free in this app, so if thats what you're wanting, I wouldn't bother unless you're willing to pay for those features over and over again.",0
"It might be useful if it could integrate with Google Calendar and Tasks. Without an intuitive way to see repeating tasks, it's really cumbersome to manage. Some of the choices are hard to explain. There's Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos... But they're all Tasks? Habits can't be scheduled or have reminders, and To-Dos can't repeat, but Dailies can be scheduled daily/weekly/whatever? The Dailies button has a calendar icon, but there's no calendar? Cool concept, though.",0
"This app is ok for making lists to check off, but they just eliminated the social features which helped me understand how to use it, so i can't imagine how a new user would learn. They ask you to email them with questions, but the response comes a few days later and presumes knowledge which a new user may not have (go to this page...idk how to get there, etc). With no ability to ask for help in real time, and no improvements since, This company seems determined to tick off its' users.",0
"Habitica has been my goto app for me and my kids and honestly it was a 5 to 4 star app. I really want it to be again, I've been subscribed to it for quite a while now. Recently though we lost the social aspect with guilds disappearing. I'm not sure how (when I get to that point) I will find like minded people for my party. There is a find party members button now, but it is anemic compared with advertising your party in a guild chat space. I feel like the community is dying, that makes me sad.",0
"Uninstalled after a few months. I was honest about my vaping habits and my character lost all HP, all gold, and went down a level. This design choice makes me NOT want to be honest about my habits. I need a judgement free app that helps aggregate my habit data. Habitica isn't it for me.",0
"Guilds was a top feature of this app, which has been recently cut. Making it subscriber only, incentivising in-app currency, or at the very least giving 1-2 months heads-up before deletion would've been courteous towards the audience. Instead we've witnessed a haphazard 1-week process, which speaks incompetence. It's still a nice app, but management buried its potential I hope it can recover some day",0
"My review was five stars until recent changes took away the Tavern. I'd been a subscriber for nearly a year and a half and played this game with friends in other countries. But without the tavern option, it became unplayable for our group of disabled friends who can't always do their daily tasks. The new pause damage option seems extremely buggy and even when paused, I took enough damage to reduce me to zero. I lost all my gold, a level in experience, and some gear. Not worth it anymore.",0
"9/3/23 update: Unfortunately the app has become a lot less useful to me with the social elements removed. I was using the Guilds function to encourage me to check the app and stay accountable. Without that aspect I'm forgetting to open the app at all and my tasks keep not getting done. I have a paid subscription because it's been such a helpful tool for me but at this point it's indistinguishable from any other habit tracker, which makes its frequent crashing less tolerable. Can't recommend. :(",0
A lot of time it doesn't notify about task or other things.,0
Needing to register and login makes me un-install your app as soon as I see the screen. Please allow me to use as a guest until I'm comfortable with creating a login for an app I don't know,0
"Cool concept, too many bugs",0
"The idea is ncie but I agree - the app is super buggy. Got a stuck notification that won't go away, and the customization page and inventory page are bugged too.",0

"You could be so good, yet you aren't The widget refused to work properly I can't possibly rely on that.",0
"Actually I think so this app is a time consumer, all the habit, task and dailies stuff is fine but pets, equipments, & stuffs like those wastes my time. After all it's build like a game it there's to consume your time while making you think you did something productive today, instead I am using an app called MDF it's the best app one can try give it a shoot and you will be satisfied, point to point, daily streak, tasks, quest, motivation to quit addiction specifically corn addiction & Much More!",0
"Seemed like a great idea until I found out the weekly streaks will only reset on Mondays - despite an option in the app to set week start to any day. Also reminders do not work - 100% charge, notifications all turned on, habitica set to run in background. These issues make this app useless for me. Cheers.",0
I honestly did not find it very motivating and it was also pretty boring.,0
"Pass on this app. The idea of turning everyday accomplishments into an interactive experience is cool. I'm not sure how original that specific idea is because other apps also help with everyday tasks by making them interactive in some way. I have two HUGE problems. First, the graphics, are come on people, I can make sprites just as well, also they are so small there is no point in cosmetics because you can't see the details. Second, the app price is quite high and added microtransactions.",0
I would give it 4 stars if the items in the marketplace updated more often.,0
"Great idea but I found the execution didn't work well for me. Layout and everything is pretty good, sometimes the game was a bit slow though and I would check things off and there wasn't a way to undo. You could manually change it but it wouldn't change the exp you gained or health lost. I also found the amount of exp earned was not enough to make me want to complete tasks, and I had a lot of daily, weekly, and even monthly ones set. Unfortunate",0
I can't play cues of my account I logged in and it kicked me out if my account could possibly be looked at that would nice I had so much progress on it,0
"Got this to help with some of the habits and daily tasks, but the groups feature set is broken. Once the feature I'm paying for is fixed, I'll consider changing the review. I am paying for groups. Not parties.",0
"I've been using this app for a long time now. I have to lower my rating because in spite of doing all the fixes advised to me, I don't reliably get notifications. It happens sporadically, if at all, and sometimes not even at the time I set the reminder to go off! I allow background usage all the time, it's allowed without battery restriction, I did everything. Just doesn't work.",0
I love this app with the major exception of it constantly losing track of the server making keeping track of my to do list more trouble. I have a good supportive community I'm involved with so I'm sticking with it but this issue should have been fixed ages ago and doesn't seem to be on THEIR to do list.,0
"Not bad, but it requires Internet for even basic functionality, which causes lag that undermines functionality, also stops functionality entirely. it would be much better if the app ran from your phone, and pushed data to the server, rather than running entirely off the server. Also, a lot of functionality locked behind a paywall, which feels like it undermines the point. I want to unlock things by completing tasks, not by paying for it - isn't that the point?",0
Doesn't work on my watch. Tried reinstall but nothing,0
Seems like an interesting app to achieve goals. I can't set more than a single reminder as a daily reminder. I thought I would be able to do a reminder with each task or goal. For me I want to schedule three reminders per day,0
it wasn't notifying me when I had things due.,0
family,0
"It does so many things well, but is lacking in several crucial aspects. On mobile, we're still not able to check off items in lists after completing them!!! Such a basic function missing is baffling to me, particularly seeing how every day there's new announcements of cosmetics and events that are completely irrelevant to what I assume is the intended purpose of the app.",0
"I don't get why you have to be connected to the internet to use this app, Why not let users use the app offline and when they have internet connection the app updates the information, There can be alot of issues with bieng have to online to use this app especially a to do app, There can be connection issues, server issues and you are in a hurry to check a task and than wolloah, the app is not working due to connection Please just change this, I don get why you thought this was a good idea",0
"I loved the concept until the app started crashing. It doesn't work on iOS or Android, either. When I had tried everything else I could do to fix the problem, I uninstalled and reinstalled it. The app still didn't work. I've only managed to use it on PC, where I originally started using it. Something is wrong with the app, it shouldn't be doing this.",0
"The app was in Spanish, switched the language to English but all the tasks stay in Spanish:(",0
so freaking laggy,0
"If I'd rated this a year ago, it would have been a 5-star review, but the removal of the guilds has taken away the main reason I started using it in the first place. It is not only the ""gamified"" factor that encourages me to be more organized, it is also the feedback from other users that I received in the various guilds. In the FAQ regarding the change the increased use of Parties was cited as a major reason, but I can only be part of one party, and I received needed feedback from 3+ guilds.",0
"The app works but you can easily cheat, like I was able to click on a task multiple times to get leveled up faster which is not encouraging,also u can only choose daily, weekly or monthly, but the activity I had was a Halloween one and even if it was a weekly activity u can't choose which days, I would prefer like a calender feature, also the star ranking I would prefer to be AI generated based on a personality questionnaire, if we don't agree we should be able to change it, this should be added",0
"Stuff seemed good, the concept of doing damage or getting damaged and earning rewards is good, but the need for the online connection to just check off my tasks or create new ones and the unresponsive UI.",0
"Dude, this is cute and all, but the social aspect is terrible. People are inconsiderate as hell and don't give 2 damns about you, just want you do what they want for challenges n stuff. L",0
This tool has gone downhill. They stopped listening to their user community a long time ago.,0

"The game is good but lost group finding, so bring your own; find a group function makes poor matches and lacks functionality. Worst of all, persistent lags & bugs make the app frustrating & sometimes unusable. For example, notifications sometimes can't be clicked, communication with the server is erratic, some actions don't register & need to be done slowly or repeated because it gets wiped from local. Super annoying bugs that everyone experiences & has been for months or years.",0

"Great in theory, but the notifications were broken so I never got reminders.",0
To do widget not updating when adding new tasks Dailies widget tasks not appearing Habits widget disappearing after placing in home screen,0
the idea and the design is great but this app should not require internet for finishing tasks or for creating new ones. it makes it really inconvenient to use in day to day life,0
"Good app, privacy nightmare. Wish there was a way to use it without signing in and handing over all of my data.",0
"Good idea, and it might be because I'm getting old, but I found the game too fiddly, too many factors. I think I'd prefer a very simple system - just a score board informed by your habits",0
I could not understand how this works at all and now I'm very frustrated. Why do most app developers neglect to introduce their apps? Update: it's been more than a week and I have no idea how this works. Looks like I'm gonna have to uninstall and keep looking. No help whatsoever.,0
Glitchy AF. I used this year's ago and it was wonderful I downloaded it again and I'm losing health faster than I can gain it because I'm marking things of as I completed as I go but it's still asking me the next day if I did any of those things. So I can either say I did them twice or lose health for not doing them at all and sometimes when I open it at night it has changed to the next day already despite it not being after midnight so I can't mark off things I've done accurately,0
"Doesn't seem to work anymore, like at all: I haven't lost any health in an entire year for failing to check in (I am NOT using the ""tavern"" to pause tasks), and it seems that it fails to even remain running in the background. I have to manually start the app to interact at all, and that defeats the entire purpose of it for me. I absolutely rely on the notification reminders, which stoped working so long ago I literally forgot I ever even had it installed until today!",0
"I've been using this app for a long time now. I have to lower my rating because in spite of doing all the fixes advised to me, I don't reliably get notifications. It happens sporadically, if at all, and sometimes not even at the time I set the reminder to go off! I allow background usage all the time, it's allowed without battery restriction, I did everything. Just doesn't work.",0
"Pass on this app. The idea of turning everyday accomplishments into an interactive experience is cool. I'm not sure how original that specific idea is because other apps also help with everyday tasks by making them interactive in some way. I have two HUGE problems. First, the graphics, are come on people, I can make sprites just as well, also they are so small there is no point in cosmetics because you can't see the details. Second, the app price is quite high and added microtransactions.",0
Pet feeding is really janky. It's pretty frustrating that it takes weeks to save up enough food to evolve a pet into a mount and then I do it and I get an error saying you do not have this mount. Didnt get any of the food I used returned so just a waste of saving up for an error :/,0
"Hi, after I installed the app, whatever I try, it won't register nor login. A spinner shows up and disappears quickly. It won't enter to the app. I would appreciate if this issue could be fixed.",0
"Loved the app, but one day it ""disconnected from server"" and could never reconnect. I cannot complete tasks or update my lists in any way. Seems busted to me. *update* Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help. It's still busted.",0
"--Update 2--: Okay, I think I have figured it out. The app doesn't sync with the servers on my WiFi, but works fine on my Data connection. Weirdly enough, the web version works on my laptop using the same WiFi. Please fix. --Update 1--: Reinstalled app. Apparently login with Google is completely broken. Not working at all. That's why maybe the data is not syncing? --Original--:No data loads upon startup; just a blank screen with 0 health, 0 xp, and 0 mana.",0
Uninstalled instantly when it wanted me to make an account. Why does everything have to be so complicated? I'd happily have 0 social features if this could just track any unlocks and progress locally in my phone only and not expect me to buy into an always online ball of stress. Make an offline version I can just start with without passwords and hassle and I'll probably enjoy the app.,0
"Taking away guilds and tavern was not very smart. Is this app dying? Parties are great, but I don't understand why guilds/parties weren't used more... together? Something? I see people spend a lot of money in this game over the years and I have quit two times in the past few years and recently came back to only see everything is the same. This app could be much better, I've been waiting for that, for years.. it seems like it has more bugs than ever now that I've returned.",0
soo buggy & notifications hardly ever work,0
"There was a server issue and now my account is suddenly gone. Edit 2024: they offered to help get my account back, i never did AND im still getting charged $6 a month despite endless attempts to cancel. Do NOT use this app.",0
"Deleting my previous review/questions. The app is the problem, the website version works great. Everything is updated on there, but my app shows nothing. Hopefully they are able to fix this so I dont have to open my laptop anytime I want to make changes or mark off a task",0
"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps.",0
"The UI UC design and user interface is not user friendly. The scheme, layout, color, and overall theme are off. I can't share my accomplishments with friends.b",0
"I like the concept, but so far it's very buggy. I assume the habits weren't working for me, since nothing happened when I hit the + or - buttons. I deinstalled the app and reinstalled it to see if that fixed it, but now I can't login, as the login screen doesn't do anything. I also couldn't register with google at all.",0
"Three months ago I would have given this app a 5 star review but the idiotic decision to remove all of the social aspects of this game has fundamentally broken it. My alerts don't work, I have won several challenges but can't collect the rewards, and half the time I can't even check off I did something because it won't connect to the servers. I'm so fed up at this point I don't even want to use it anymore.",0
"Pretty disappointed that the first wall I hit is having to login or register. I get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss. The app looked promising and I was really impressed with the bit of pixel art I got to see. However, I'm not sure I want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet.",0
"Notifications for tasks have been broken for like more than a year The maintainers are aware of the issue and haven't found luck fixing it, it's a pretty essential feature. Otherwise it's a great app Note: the developer responded I've already done their recommendations and reported the bug",0
"God this whole thing was so messy. I could barely even make an account, and it kept telling me there was already an account with that email. Then once I finally got it to work, I tried to check something off, and it kept saying ""Server outdated, resync or reload"" or something similar. I did everything I could- force stop, remove all data, etc, nothing worked. I love the idea, but god it wasn't done well.",0
"Please add feature: - Statistics for Habits & Dailies, when we click the habit/dailies, instead edit we can see daily progress in monthly calendar view. - Repetition Schedule for To Do. Update: 3 years and still no sight this is will implemented.",0
The application does not ask for audio permissions. This causes it to play through the ring and notifications routing. This is a problem for dynamic volume adjustments and their developers and designers. The upside is that I found a synth wave-set no worse than traffic sounds.,0
I can't login with Google. It just shows a white box.,0
fix bug if tick got red error and it wont tick.,0
I hope you don't ignore this feedback The concept of the app is great but it lacks a lot of things 1. I wanted to see my streaks in my habit and my daillies can you please add a graph of productivity and a callendar that checks whenever I've done my daily 2. Can you add dalliy or nightly feedback journal Please don't make it a premium version though I'm fine with ads,0
"Can't even log in. Seems to stop working or freeze up every time. Just downloaded the app for the first time, can't make a new account or log in. Waste of time, will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen.",0
"Reminders don't work reliably, the game aspect is boring (everything after level 14 and maxing out the base armour (which is only a few hundred gold) is cosmetic; no new spells, no better armour, etc., and both Web and Android reload takes forever (tl;dr: garbage performance)",0
"Just starting and learning how to use. Unable to set correct due date on tasks. When I select that task has a due date, todays date appears. When I click that date the calendar displays. Allgood so far. But when I select a date on the calendar and close it, the due date is still today.",0
"I have been wanting to try out this app for a while. I registered, and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen. i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options. Will send photos if needed. Will change rating once this is fixed.",0
"I love the idea and the app is very well laid out. However, daily reminder rarely notify, the to-do panel oftentimes renders blank, and there is no offline support.",0
"Unable to register/login properly. When I register with google or just type my info then press the button nothing happens. If I then close the app and open again I seem to have an account, but it hasn't started me on a tutorial and I can't earn points from anything. Broken app is broken & should be fixed because it's a really cool idea.",0
"Devs intentionally prevented you from manually setting your timezone even though that is a super basic feature. If you setup your account using a privacy browser without knowing this and want to continue using said browser, the daily rollovers will be badly uncoordinated with your actual time. I saw on github the devs pretentiously dismiss the idea of letting users manually set it due to them (not) knowing what is best for you the user. Incredibly annoying first impression so have my thanks!",0
"I should be able to use the app when offline, and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet. It shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox!",0
Where do my entries keep disappearing to? I spent hours setting up Habits and Dailies yesterday. Used a bunch. Today? Effing GONE. Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot. Thought / hoped it was a fluke yesterday when entries would vanish every time I'd close my phone or the app. Nope. App is exacerbating my existential crisis! I could chew steal and spit nails at this point. #RageQuit,0
"I literally can't get past the login/sign up page. I have tried all three ways of signing up but the app does nothing. I tried deleting cache, deleting data and even uninstalled and reinstalled but it still doesn't work.",0
"Stuck at the user name choosing. App made a username based on my email, when I tried changing it, the app says that every possible username is taken, I tried to put in the one the app suggested at the beginning,it appears to be unavailable too now.",0
Edit: For how they treat their volunteer community. Shame that they had so little respect for those that loved the game and gave back for years. I can't support a team that treats people that way. ....... Habitica is great for me to get that little extra dopamine rush when I complete a task. I wish that the to do section maybe had with a visual separation between the days that tasks are due? This would help a lot. Thanks Habitica!,0
"My phone is a Samsung S8+. The introduction screen is mostly blank, and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up. I didnt go any further.",0
I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.,0
"I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged.",0
"Never have I ever...written a review on an app. Such things are beneath me. Having said that, I was super annoyed that I'd have to reenter my to dos and dailys and basically my schedule of stuff to keep track of. Great idea for an app (especially for us gamers) but not so good on ze other stuff. Will not use. Delete. Game Over.",0
"Ever get a phone call from a Salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to? this is the app that does it. it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder. this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it. once you log in, the game is a huge disappointment. mypoli has everything over this.",0
Requires being online to use. Which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated. Would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection (I live and work in rural areas) . Had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day.,0
"Broken app on Android. Tried to create a new account and objects were missing from the app. For instance, the initial tutorial only had pictures and no words. Also when making my avatar, there were no images or options that showed up. Worked fine on my wife's iPhone but not my note 9.",0
"Class system is broke. Tried to select a mage when I hit level 10, but it kept getting an error. Somehow ended up as a rogue and now it wants a purchase to change class. Also has an issue with scheduling monthly tasks to occur on the same day of the same week (i.e. The third week of each month on Sunday)",0
"I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that.",0
"Can't log in with google, can't register. Apparently I have an email associated but can't retrieve the password. I've lost any interest I had in using the app. It's not worth the effort. Devs, please don't ask me to email support. It's not worth the time tome, just fix your app.",0
"Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.",0
"I love this app. It has truly helped me stay organized in a more efficient way. The biggest help with this is the guilds. The guilds have been uplifting and have given challenges that help me even more, even helped my mental state. The guilds are also how many people find party members. I give a one star rating because Habitica is getting rid of guilds and the tavern. Without them, there will be no community, no helpful challenges for specific needs, and no way to find party members in the app.",0
Recent update has so many bugs. Tasks and habits will be gone upon first opening the app. I have to restart the app every time I want to do something. Save and delete buttons are the same color as the banner or gone entirely. I love this game but I'm about to be done after this update. üôÅ,0
This was a great app & the best bit for me was the guilds which allowed me to get a bit of external motivation & help with my disabilities which can impact my ability to be consistent enough to be on a team with others (which is limited in number anyway). I paid for an annual subscription to help support these features so hearing that the guild function is being closed means I will no longer be paying. I may as well just use a paper list or another app without guilds. 1* due to removing guilds.,0
Notifications don't work.,0
"So... I downloaded the app, I made my account, and I created my first daily task. Exciting right? Next thing you know, the app crashes and it NEVER opens again. Just keeps crashing each time I open it. I really hope this issue in resolved fast since this is a fantastic idea of an app, but until then, 1 star is the best I can give.",0
"No offline support? Seriously? It's 2024 people! Besides, I would love to see time tracking integrated into the app.",0
"Just completed a huge and enormously stressful to-do, which I had logged in-game. When I ticked it off my list I lost a level and got a patronizing message. I get the impression this is designed solely for a neurotypical experience because instead of getting rewarded for doing something that had my anxiety going crazy, I got punished. Uninstalled.",0
"Very limited character creator. There is not even an option for long hair. I get locking customization options behind a pay wall, but not offering the most basic options is unacceptable. UI is cluttered and frustrating to use. Tutorial and examples do a very poor job of explaining what each section is. I had to rely on 3rd parties and half the people I spoke to were also confused and gave up using it as intended. Rather than help with productivity, this app ended up reducing my productivity",0
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.,0
"Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed",0
Very depressing. I put in the effort for quests. I got excited about my pending damage for nothing. Quest ends just before my cron and all my pending is lost. I haven't been able to use my pending anything for days. That's not motivation. It's devastation. It never matters if i task or don't if my whole turn is skipped because of timing. Working hard for just collecting stuff and never getting to actually quest. My pending should keep rolling over until I get a turn. I should get a turn.,0
"As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E",0
"I purchased a one-year subscription and canceled the automatic renewal. They cancled the gems that I should be getting every 3 months and said ""Since you cancelled the auto-renew, that subscription is still active, and that is what has pushed your next hourglass for the month-to-month subscription to February 2024. This is expected, correct behavior. We understand this may not be to your preference, but we have clarified the situation as much as we can"".",0
The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying. This has been catalogued by others. When its fixed I'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iPhone users. (I have a Samsung S9),0
"I signed up for account, it wouldnt log me in on the app but sent me an email and i was able to get in that way. Made a couple tasks, wouldnt let me go further. Then app finally let me create tasks, but every time i tried to ""do"" a task it said i was out of sync. Logged out of online and app. Tried to relog into app. It does the little spinny thing like its going to start then doesnt leave log in screen.",0
"Server issues ended up draining about 125% of my battery today, 45% of the day's phone useage with an activity of ""less than 1m,"" presumably due to the home screen widget. Between that and the strange choices of the staff lately (removing all the community features that made this app stand out), I'll be moving to Offline Notepad. As someone who's used Habitica since 2014, let me suggest you find something less fiddly; stability has been an issue with Habit RPG/now Habitica since the beginning.",0
"First thing I did when I installed the app was disable notifications and yet I still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long. That aside, the app is poorly made. UI is very buggy. Chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly. Sometimes the main ui responds to nothing. You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription.",0
"Used to be one of the best task managing apps out there, even without the gamified features. The biggest selling point was its online community as you could connect with people and hold each other accountable. Unfortunately, due to a falling out with their volunteer mod team a few months back, they've now removed almost all social features. I can no longer recommend habitica.",0
"I really really dispise apps that require you to be connected in order to use them. There's no reason for it. I'm a professional pilot which means if I can't check off habits while I'm at work, and I cross into midnight in whatever time zone, I lose points making the whole game pretty lame. There is no need to have to be connected in order to check off habits.",0
"2021 update: the app continues to lose data and just be janky in general. My streaks are constantly being lost even though the streak is a weekly thing and I've done this habit 6 days in a row? Sometimes the app opens and just displays no data, no habits, no dailies, and has to be force closed and reopened. It's all really discouraging, I'd hoped the problems had been worked out since I stopped using it last but they haven't.",0
"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional.",0
"Paid features are just cosmetics. There's no ""game."" There's just a jingle when you do a task & earn meaningless ""gold"" & ""experience"" in order to ""level up."" You can spend gold on pointless tools & armor that do nothing. The""Quests"" feature is strongly intended for multiplayer. You earn pets, experience, gold & armor from quests, which do not do anything except look cool or pretty. Nothing meaningful has been released, & they removed a graph habit tracker in the past. There's no adventure.",0
"I used to use this app often & got a subscription to it. Then I needed to financially cut back on stuff, and this app was one that got cut. I never deleted it, but I canceled the subscription& stopped using it. Then, after about a year, I started getting charged again out of nowhere! I know for certain I got a new card since then, so I literally have no idea how they got my new info, but I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that an app started charging me again after a year with *NO* warning.",0
"This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions.",0
"This seems like a fun idea, and was recommended to me as especially helpful for people with ADHD, so I was intrigued. Unfortunately, I have encountered a bug where when I get to the screen where I choose my screen name and username, I cannot press the next button after filling out the name and username. Then, when I exit the app and go back to it, it's the default character and I cannot customise it/my account.",0
"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",0
"While the web version of Habitica has been working fine, the mobile app has been unusable for days. ""Server connection lost."" For days. I can understand needing to connect to servers to receive gold/xp/damage from checking off habits/dailies/to-dos, but the fact that you can't check off tasks without a connection is a major flaw. Currently looking to switch to a new app where all the productivity features can be done completely on the client side.",0
This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.,0
"I paid for the gems, it took my money but did NOT give me any gems that I paid for. Garbage scamming app.",0
"Unfortunately, the notifications pop at totally random times on random days, which are few and far between. They're the whole reason I downloaded the app, so I can't recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable accountability system.",0
"Both the app and the site are super buggy, the app won't refresh the daily tasks everyday and sometimes when you erase tasks they stay there bugged, you can't get rid of them or check them or anything. The app also constantly gives me the error ""lost connection"" although I have quite good signal and connection and no other app has struggles with data or WiFi... It is a good idea the app but a poor execution.",0
It's been 4 years and there's still no custom sounds on Android. Seriously?,0
"I was very excited to try this but the app is a joke. There's no proper user flow or error handling- after registering I got no confirmation, I had to quit and open the app again so it would let me login. I added goals but they were in no way saved after reinstalling for troubleshooting. I can't check them as completed. No tutorial, no character loads like in the screenshots. It's not a network problem either, it's just a broken app",0
Does not send noticeable push notifications to keep you engaged. Rubbish,0
"Offline restrictions suckcs as someone who spends most of his work day without any network, app is in big part unusable and big offline baner is annoying.",0
"Asked me to rate it before I've had a chance to see a single feature. Disgusting. Definite cash grab vibes. Don't waste your time. If you're asking for a 5-star review before I even get to see the app, you're not trustworthy.",0
"Are you kidding? All the cool character customization items (which are very limited in the first place) cost real money. I thought the purpose of the app was to help people by motivating them with rewards, but there's absolutely nothing interesting you can buy for your character with the regular currency. What is the point then? Ridicilous. Put ads in it if anything, but not lock the very few items you have available behind a currency that costs real money.",0
"The server connection error is well known and there is no known fix. I find that it makes the app nearly unusable. Since the error wastes my time (you gotta close and relaunch the app to fix it), Habitica often prevents me from handling my real life, rather than helping me with it. Edit: dropping one star cause the issue persists. This company is sinking fast. Edit 2: connection errors everywhere... another star is gone. Moved elsewhere. Such a pity though, I met good friends there.",0
"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality.",0
"Functionally very very limited. Try setting up a habit for every x days, weeks, x times per week. No rescheduling, no reminder settings (remind x minutes before, remind on time) No sound /notification settings, you can choose a sound theme, tho no idea what it is or if I'd like it. On s plus side the rewards are nice and creative and you can pay to get more of them.",0
"Removal of guilds really wrecked Habitica. I had a subscription that I let lapse and will not renew. I was part of a couple of challenges that greatly enhanced my life, and a big part of the experience were the guilds attached to those challenges. Checking in on other's progress was a big part of them. I've collected all the pets, mounts, and gear I wanted (used it about a year), so I've learned how to make dynamic habit trackers in Google Sheets and am transitioning off Habitica. Such a waste.",0
"Frequent Connectivity Issues!! I have used Habitica on and off for the last 4 years. Recently I re-joined, wanting to take control of my good habits and trying to eliminate the bad ones, I decided to support the platform by paying a year's subscription. Big mistake. Most of my time on the app is spent refreshing and refreshing over and over, waiting for it to be usable again. The performance is truly terrible and it takes away from the good that this app can do! Truly a shame.",0
"EDIT: developer response does not help with the fact that I am stuck on the ""refill your health and try again"" screen. I literally cannot use the app because it won't let me. That's 90% of the reason I gave it a one star, because I cannot use it anymore. That's what I meant when I said it ""practically forced me to uninstall,"" it just froze completely. Uninstalling and re-installing did not fix the problem. I guess you just didn't read the end of my review.",0
this used to be a good app but then they removed all social aspects with no valid explanation. it's no longer good or useful without those.,0
"I havent tried the app yet so I can't give more than 1 star, no point prompting review on initial app start. I just made the account too.",0
"A very badly built application, it constantly lost connection to the servers and would crash, or not update. The UI would freeze, many UI elements are non-responsive when clicked. I got to level 10, and even though I was doing my tasks, I still lost all my energy and died, and fell back to lvl4. It quickly moves you to microtransactions to buy diamonds to stay alive and away from habit forming behaviours. On the whole it's a good idea, but this missed the mark by a long way.",0
you have to be online and you can't change the colors of the tasks(they go red when they aren't going bad it's just a long to do),0
very unforgiving. it's supposed to garner and encourage good habits but I lost all my accumulated gold and skills as soon as I died. uninstalling!,0

"Servers are still garbage. I wrote an entire 20 item to-do list and shock and behold; ""sErVeR eRRoR"" pops up again and deletes the entire thing. I'm gone as soon as I find a replacement app. Update: Still has constant server issues and disconnects 3 months later lol; embarrassing really. Probably shouldn't have fired their volunteer mods and coders.",0
"The notifications do not work, which kind of defeats the whole point of using this app. It's an incredibly cool looking app, with a fatal flaw.",0
"Was great, but now is super slow. Even after clicking start my day it doesn't understand that it's a different day so it's keeping all my tasks that a finished from a previous day. Very annoying, uninstalling.",0
"I used to love habitica and was a regular subscriber in the past, but lack of new features for years and even removing the existing ones is not something that attracts. Especially after I read about moderators' situation on reddit, I won't be coming back anymore. The habitica used to be a big part of my life and was even a free contributor, but seeing all this makes me want to leave and never return.",0
"Seemed like a great idea until I found out the weekly streaks will only reset on Mondays - despite an option in the app to set week start to any day. Also reminders do not work - 100% charge, notifications all turned on, habitica set to run in background. These issues make this app useless for me. Cheers.",0

There is no statistics...,0
"Couldn't even get it to connect to the server long enough to enter my initial habits. A great concept, poorly executed.",0
"Frequent Connectivity Issues!! I have used Habitica on and off for the last 4 years. Recently I re-joined, wanting to take control of my good habits and trying to eliminate the bad ones, I decided to support the platform by paying a year's subscription. Big mistake. Most of my time on the app is spent refreshing and refreshing over and over, waiting for it to be usable again. The performance is truly terrible and it takes away from the good that this app can do! Truly a shame.",0
"While the web version of Habitica has been working fine, the mobile app has been unusable for days. ""Server connection lost."" For days. I can understand needing to connect to servers to receive gold/xp/damage from checking off habits/dailies/to-dos, but the fact that you can't check off tasks without a connection is a major flaw. Currently looking to switch to a new app where all the productivity features can be done completely on the client side.",0
"Three months ago I would have given this app a 5 star review but the idiotic decision to remove all of the social aspects of this game has fundamentally broken it. My alerts don't work, I have won several challenges but can't collect the rewards, and half the time I can't even check off I did something because it won't connect to the servers. I'm so fed up at this point I don't even want to use it anymore.",0
Cant login,0
App has become unusable. Stuck on previous day since 15 minutes.,0
"Not for me, made me feel even more anxious",0
"The server connection error is well known and there is no known fix. I find that it makes the app nearly unusable. Since the error wastes my time (you gotta close and relaunch the app to fix it), Habitica often prevents me from handling my real life, rather than helping me with it. Edit: dropping one star cause the issue persists. This company is sinking fast. Edit 2: connection errors everywhere... another star is gone. Moved elsewhere. Such a pity though, I met good friends there.",0
"Nasty , biased admins and creators. Anti-Christian.",0
i have problem with login and registering. i click on the button but nothing happens.,0
"A very badly built application, it constantly lost connection to the servers and would crash, or not update. The UI would freeze, many UI elements are non-responsive when clicked. I got to level 10, and even though I was doing my tasks, I still lost all my energy and died, and fell back to lvl4. It quickly moves you to microtransactions to buy diamonds to stay alive and away from habit forming behaviours. On the whole it's a good idea, but this missed the mark by a long way.",0
"I wanted to use this app however going through set up slow was so painful I gave up. Ap is slow, doesn't respond quickly or at all to input. having to input something 5 times and then have it not work is a fail",0
Terrible,0
I hate it. My guy died and it was because I suck at life. This app just affirms I'm horrible and can never change. I wish I never saw it and just accepted myself for who I am. This app made me have lower self esteem.,0
FORCED FEMALE GENDER,0
Requires an account.,0
"Please add feature: - Statistics for Habits & Dailies, when we click the habit/dailies, instead edit we can see daily progress in monthly calendar view. - Repetition Schedule for To Do. Update: 3 years and still no sight this is will implemented.",0
"I don't like the new changes at all.. No tavern, no guilds, it feels like normal task app..",0
Couldn't even connect to internet,0
"Can't log in , always something wrong",0
The structure of the app is confusing...ppl can easily escape damage by using only habits instead of dailies,0
Unstable with the connection losing all my tasks unnecessarily,0
"This app was good until they decided to remove Tavern. Tavern was the most important feature in Habatica. How are the new users supposed to join any party or socialize without the Tavern option? I request Habitica to please bring back Tavern, its so difficult to join a party without Tavern unless you have friends who use this app already.",0
"Not bad, but it requires Internet for even basic functionality, which causes lag that undermines functionality, also stops functionality entirely. it would be much better if the app ran from your phone, and pushed data to the server, rather than running entirely off the server. Also, a lot of functionality locked behind a paywall, which feels like it undermines the point. I want to unlock things by completing tasks, not by paying for it - isn't that the point?",0
"Taking away guilds and tavern was not very smart. Is this app dying? Parties are great, but I don't understand why guilds/parties weren't used more... together? Something? I see people spend a lot of money in this game over the years and I have quit two times in the past few years and recently came back to only see everything is the same. This app could be much better, I've been waiting for that, for years.. it seems like it has more bugs than ever now that I've returned.",0
"Incompatible with NordPass password manager AND that app does not allow pasting on the registration form. If you dare switch app whilst on the registration screen, the app will hang and eventually crash.",0
"Removal of guilds really wrecked Habitica. I had a subscription that I let lapse and will not renew. I was part of a couple of challenges that greatly enhanced my life, and a big part of the experience were the guilds attached to those challenges. Checking in on other's progress was a big part of them. I've collected all the pets, mounts, and gear I wanted (used it about a year), so I've learned how to make dynamic habit trackers in Google Sheets and am transitioning off Habitica. Such a waste.",0
Used to be a great app but now it is going downhill fast. Tons of lag and now announced they're removing social features: guilds The claim is to focus on gamifying tasks. But social aspect is a huge motivator and part of games too. Even single player games have communities of fans. Please reconsider tearing our little families apart. Edit: since you did reply here's mine. The sudden abrupt removal of the guilds threw countless ND people into disarray. People who did rely on it. Thanks,0
"I can't even open the ""game"" Sorry now i can",0
Randomly loses progress /streaks,0
Registration needed,0
Removed guilds,0
Its 2023 and still not working without internet,0

"Loved the app, but one day it ""disconnected from server"" and could never reconnect. I cannot complete tasks or update my lists in any way. Seems busted to me. *update* Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help. It's still busted.",0

Too much,0

Don't waste your time,0
The mods are nudcases,0
"Asked me to rate it before I've had a chance to see a single feature. Disgusting. Definite cash grab vibes. Don't waste your time. If you're asking for a 5-star review before I even get to see the app, you're not trustworthy.",0

"I used to love habitica and was a regular subscriber in the past, but lack of new features for years and even removing the existing ones is not something that attracts. Especially after I read about moderators' situation on reddit, I won't be coming back anymore.

I haven't had a chance to use it before you ask for a rating this Is what I think so far.,0
"Genuinely disappointed :( I don't get a single notification at the time I scheduled them for. I turned off battery saver and another setting to actually get the notifications to pop up at all, but they come 3-16 minutes late on day 1. The whole purpose for an app like this is for timed notifications to keep a tighter schedule without using Google spyware. 3:03 is not 3:00. Yes, even 3 minutes can throw your entire day off with a tight enough schedule. Fix this and I'll reinstall.",0
Its very interested,0
"I havent tried the app yet so I can't give more than 1 star, no point prompting review on initial app start. I just made the account too.",0
"Offline restrictions suckcs as someone who spends most of his work day without any network, app is in big part unusable and big offline baner is annoying.",0
"This would have been a good idea if it wasn't always online. There is no reason for that, other than DRM and control, which go hand in hand.",0
"Unfortunately, the notifications pop at totally random times on random days, which are few and far between. They're the whole reason I downloaded the app, so I can't recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable accountability system.",0

MAKE IT OFFLINE,0

Glitchy from the start. When I finally got it to work I couldn't get the habits to actually add it subtract. After set up I hit a paywall,0

Probably shouldn't have fired their volunteer mods and coders.",0

very unforgiving. it's supposed to garner and encourage good habits but I lost all my accumulated gold and skills as soon as I died. uninstalling!,0
"Reminders don't work reliably, the game aspect is boring (everything after level 14 and maxing out the base armour (which is only a few hundred gold) is cosmetic; no new spells, no better armour, etc., and both Web and Android reload takes forever (tl;dr: garbage performance)",0

"Initially, I was really impressed with the features, particularly the ability to pause damage, until I realized pausing damage makes the game almost completely unplayable. You can't do damage, but still take damage from party member's missed dailies. The interface also has text contrast issues. Aside from being inaccessible, the penalty for death is harsh.

"The notifications do not work, which kind of defeats the whole point of using this app. It's an incredibly cool looking app, with a fatal flaw.",0
"EDIT: developer response does not help with the fact that I am stuck on the ""refill your health and try again"" screen. I literally cannot use the app because it won't let me. That's 90% of the reason I gave it a one star, because I cannot use it anymore. That's what I meant when I said it ""practically forced me to uninstall,"" it just froze completely. Uninstalling and re-installing did not fix the problem. I guess you just didn't read the end of my review.",0
No instructions,0
Does not send noticeable push notifications to keep you engaged. Rubbish,0

fix bug if tick got red error and it wont tick.,0
this used to be a good app but then they removed all social aspects with no valid explanation. it's no longer good or useful without those.,0
soo buggy & notifications hardly ever work,0
I got locked out of my planner. After entering my paascode the app said that the passcode was wrong. It was not wrong. I suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on June 17th of this year. I haven't received any response yet. I found my way around this problem by this time. I will not renew my subscription anymore. I will look for another app developer with a better customer service.,0

"It went woke with non pertinent holidays (announcing entire months, like that's a holiday) so it's rather distracting and haranguing without just bank and govt holidays that effect ""business"".

"Cannot batch delete previous repeating events. We've been asking for this for years and it is a simple procedure to implement but for some reason they don't seem to listen to us no matter how much we email them and ask for this, instead we have to waste gobs of time for something that should be able to be completed in a few seconds. If you people wake up and fix this I will give you more stars",0
"Very good calendar, but on my second phone is not full version. Bad. Thank you very much for your answer. My Samsung 8 was broken and when I installed on this phone license disappeared.

Sucks,0
Events no longer work and are self deleting,0
Free version is hot garbage,0
I really enjoyed this calendar when I first got it. I even went to the premium so I could use colors. It worked great when I first got it. Then there were no color options. I don't feel I should have to fix anything. Uninstalled this app.,0
"I just found out that this app has 19! trackers for advertisements and profiling. your privacy policy is written for the pro version and not for the free. you can only opt out for yahoo flurry. but what about the Amazon, adcolony, apploving, Facebook ads, fyber and 13 other trackers? your not talking about those in your privicy policy.",0
Latest update is huge power drain. I've used this for years (pro version). I could keep my phone going all day with an overnight charge. I have to set it to not run in the background which means no reminders. HELP!!!!,0
This is so frustrating. This app wontbsyncvwith my pc and so on. Why do they always change things that work? I am tryingbthis because outlook wont work with my tablet anymore. Butbthis wont sync with my PC. Thinking of going back to old fashioned calendar. Ug. Really learningbto hate computers and the programs that changevall the time,0
"I used to love this... now on my phone it's oddly presenting and tasks are worthless, no syncing, and just too much work. Seems to have been since last update. Support I was given was also unhelpful. Went into actual google calendar and realized it hadn't been syncing for 3 plus weeks Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Half way working but now its showing I dont have premium (wrong) and wont let me access. 6 hours now... big ""pro' stamped across app. We shall see how long until my next contact.",0
"Used the free version for years, no issues, didn't need the pro features. Then they started putting in ads - not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work. Worst bait-and-switch I've ever seen.",0
"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y",0
"Don't waste your time with this 'upgrade' from their older version. You might as well just use Google's calendar app. The colors are too bright and the interface is ugly. And when you do the 'upgrade' you get the opportunity to re-link all your contacts with all of your appointments in both the old and new versions. So I'm going to have to spend the next 3-4 hours deleting the name, address, and the software gibberish from each appointment and then find and re-link all the contacts. Brilliant!",0
"Another major disappointment for me. Badge stuck on the number 30 forever. Which means it will be correct once a month. Why can't I find a damn calendar üìÖ that shows the correct date on the home page badge? This has been very annoying for me. My current calendar is stuck on 28.

"I use the 4x2 widget. When Inxlick in the day of the month it opens the day. When I click in the events it sometimes opens the month view, but other times it will open the event viewer.

Developer, as stated, I did follow your steps, which are outdated btw. All my other calendar apps work fine. Yours doesn't.",0
"Under app's description, it states: ""sync with Google... ‚ñ™ OR use our app as local schedule planner"" This implies the app can sync with G Suite OR it can be used independently. HOWEVER, you can't even use the app UNLESS you allow access to the Google calendar. I wanted a calendar INDEPENDENT of G Suite. Couldn't do it. I turned off sync and still this app appeared as a ""local calendar"" under G Suite and MADE CHANGES to my Google calendar. That was exactly what I DID NOT WANT. What's the point?",0
Absolute nightmare and the worst service. I purchased the professional series on my old phone and got a new phone and was unable to utilize all of the professional options on the new phone amd ultimately had to buy ot again after sending 2 emails to tech support I got a very informal explanation to try amd fix. I asked them to call to explain but no sent another useless email to someone who is npt tech savvy. So purchased it again reluctantly because I run a in home training company and needed access to it. Can we purchase and get the app works fine until yesterday every appointment was gone all of my conversations all my clients for upcoming appointments for the next month. In addition the appointments fall off the previous months so I can't see what I did. I sent another email until now I have not had a response. I expect call tell me where the appointment went. Experience and you're going to lose your data. Don't buy it!,0
"Revised: Initially I gave this 4* but have dropped it twice. I discovered that not everything was syncing correctly. The big flag of this was when I changed a multi-day event and added another section using Google calendar on my PC. The changes never appeared in BC on either Android device, even though they show correctly in Google calendar on the same devices. I tried resynching, read the help, no change. Can't get support to understand the problem, so back to Google calendar's grotty widgets.",0

"Be aware that by upgrading to this version, you will have to pay for a lot of features that were included in the previous paid version. Shame of you --- This is a money grab. I will return to the old version because it is not that much different.",0
Used to be good. Now contains horrible full screen adds that are hard to skip or not to click.,0
New update Doesn't download from Google play. Get error message. I bought the after Amazon not the Google Play store so I'm not even sure why it's trying to update through the Play store. Regardless every other app works fine on my phone with regard to downloading just yours is broken. In addition the confusing nature of which version I bought is unclear. It doesn't help that your help teams English is not great. I could not understand what was trying to be articulated in email,0
"At first I liked this so so much I went pro. Excellent syncing, my major bug bear in other apps. But since going pro my Outlook calendars stopped syncing completely. Now I have no events at all and I'm savvy, I've checked EVERYTHING. IF YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS TO TRY TO GET IT TO WORK, it just ain't good enough.

"Great App.works well for the most part. It deserves a 5 star for most of the things it does, but you can read about all the good stuff from other reviews.

I'm sure there's a simple fix. A response would be good. Happy to change my star rating once resolved.",0
"Suddenly not free. Been using for years. Now I just had to pay to stay ad-free. I did not want the extras of ""pro"" I just wanted the app I was using to continue to do what it was doing and not show ads.

"I change my review to 1 star after I paid for the pro version, you said that the repete task feature is only available on the premium plan, but I paid it and still can not set it up. I was planning to use the repete task as a habit tracker on this calendar and it does not work",0
"The app per se is good. Sadly the customer service when you have an issue is no where to be found. For about a month i have sent emails since the app after an update went back to basic, even after paying the pro version about 3 years ago. No help has been provided after all this time. In my view, you can make it or break it when you take care of your paying customer or ignore him. It seems like they dont see it that way. Perhaps now they will pay attention.",0
"The ads that started after a week of a nice ad-free experience were the most awful malware like things forcing downloads of apps without my permission, popping up at random with sound even when the app wasn't open and more. This is an unacceptable way to treat your free users. I'd much rather have been given a 7 day free trial and be forced to pay to use it after that than what this is.",0
"I initially found this app very useful, so I upgraded to the premium version for the automatic backup feature. When I got a new phone and transferred all of my data to the new device, I discovered none of my backups had actually occurred and over two years of habit tracking data had been lost.",0
"Not a fan of how this directly links to your calendar. I wanted a separate app to track two different sets of calendars. If I wanted to see the calendars shared with me on Google, I would just use Google calendar. When you turn off the view of one calendar in this app, it also turns it off in your Google calendar. I like the concept of the tabs at the bottom but unless I can un-sync this from Google, it is useless for me.",0
"Sync doesn't work properly with Microsoft calendar anymore, it was once great but this makes it useless for me. Sometimes I see new appointments I added to my Outlook calendar, sometimes it doesn't show up. The reminders mostly don't show up and I have duplicated entries sometimes.",0
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star.",0
"Ok app. It's better than the default app that came with my phone. However it has a lot of issues. You can't organize tasks or events, it automatically alphabetizes everything. I tell it I don't want notifications. I change it in settings & it adds a random notification. If you set something to be a recurring monthly task, once you click it after it's done, it moves it to a different day the next month. It's not reliable. I switched to a paper calender, which is easier to view & organize.",0
"Update: My events prior to 2021 are all gone! Do you delete events after a certain time??? I'm having trouble with duplicate events popping up on my calendar and nobody is responding to my emails. Also, the custom color settings should transfer over when you get a new phone. I always have to start from scratch choosing my colors again when I switch phones. Why can't the color choices move with us?",0
"I've had this app for years, even upgraded it to the premium version. Loved it.. then as the developers started updating, I started having many issues. Each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version; it was inconsistent. I wrote the customer service for assistance and I didn't get any help. So i lived with it. Most recently, I started receiving ads after every entry; Not okay!! I sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to; which is why I'm here. Help!",0
"I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable. That was a bad business mistake you can correct. I hope you correct it soon. I'll be checking back to see.",0
"I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.",0
Used this calendar for years without any issue. Now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out. Terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers. They've lost me as a user as I refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The ads suck and are annoying.,0
"Its a great app I used for years. I was ok with ads, but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable. When I need Calendar info, I need it RIGHT NOW. I'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads I'm out. Edit post response: I'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version, because it is better than stock Calendar. But its not 7 bucks better. So if you're not going to remove full screen ads, after years of using, gotta say buh bye...",0
"Now there are ads. I have used this app for years and there were no annoying ads. Now i randomly get a full screen ad with no way to dismiss, after saving a new calendar entry. Bad move. A small ad at the bottom of the screen would be ok, but a full screen ad that has to play all the way through? No thanks. Will find a new app. Very disappointed.",0
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.,0
"App is total garbage on my Samsung classic watch 4. Have it for years on my phone, but installed on my watch today. Crashes immediately when trying to add an event. First time I tried to add event, it asked me which keyboard to use. Chose Google kB and it crashed imediately. Reinstalled and tried to add event, and also immediately crashes, no prompting for which keyboard this time. Guess I'll stick with samsung calendar.",0
"This freezes and requires reboot constantly. I have a oneplus 7T on Android 10 and this is the ONLY app that doesn't work right. I even bought the pro version thinking that might help, but it's still horrible. So you think my system is the problem even though this is the only app I have issues with? I go to press a calendar date on the widget to get the details for that day and nothing happens. I have to reboot my phone and then it will work for a little bit, then fail again.",0
"Love this calendar up until a few days ago. The ads used to be fairly non-intrusive, which I get and could totally live with. Now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar. Totally unacceptable when I'm with a customer. Absolutely do NOT recommended this calendar as currently configured.",0
"So, 2 (almost 3) years ago I purchased the pro version of this app. At the time, that unlocked access to all present and future ""pro"" aspects. Now, however, after a long list of changes, the fact that I have already paid for this app and been using it for years doesn't seem to matter. I'm now constantly being asked to repurchase a product I already own. To add insult to injury, features that used to be standard (drag & drop) are now a pro feature, that I should already own, cost $6.99 and up.",0
"Very disappointing and misleading application. Most of the features it shows in the store images, you can't even verify if it has it or not, or if it even works unless your willing to shell out $6.99 immediately. Even the colorful banner and menu system shown above, isn't even listed in the pro options it displays.",0
"Ads that completely take over your phone & have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them. - EDIT - It's untrue what the developer says regarding ads appearing once every 18 hours, it is more frequent. The ""skip"" the developer is referring to is NOT instantly available, you must wait a timer out. - It wouldn't be a problem if the ads weren't so disruptive, they literally take over your screen. I have no problem with small less annoying ads.",0
"I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable.",0
"I've used this app for years and have loved it up until now. Now I get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what I'm doing. I don't mind a full page ad that I can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom, but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable. Seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app. If this continues I'll find another app.",0
"About a year ago I left a review about sync errors. I have given this app full permission in android settings. It still does not update changes to my work calendar. This app does not work as you think it does. Making a change to your Google calendar, even with full sync permissions in android will not update the change in event. I'm deleting this app as it is no longer useful. Update May 8: I did those suggestions, and thank you for the help. But it is still now showing updates.",0
"I do understand ""free"" means accepting advertising, but your recent ads are horrible, cannot be shorten, and sometimes embarrassing. I uninstall now. Left you two stars for old times sake. *Added after Dev response. It wasn't the frequency. It was the advert that was served. I think it was some kind of Japanese pornstar (not sure cuz I was busily trying to close it, to no avail). I was in meeting with Client, checking next date, and the unstoppable advert happened. Simply cannot risk this again",0
"Putting dark mode behind a paywall is straight up torture/ableism, my dudes üôÉ Edit: I'd be completely fine with the paid themes if a basic light and dark theme was available for free. I (and other people with sensory issues) can't use an app without dark mode at all. It's not a cool design feature, it's an accessibility issue. Free versions are there so people can try the app out before they pay, if you make that inaccessible, disabled people aren't even allowed to make that decision.",0
Installed this app with intention of possibly purchasing the premium version. Then I found out that it's an app that requires a subscription. I am so sick and tired of apps that require subscriptions.,0
"TO THE DEVELOPER: There's GOOGLE Exchange and it DOESN'T let me use a Microsoft account as it fails to add it every single time I put in my credentials. I'm sick of repeating myself. BC2 doesn't properly support Microsoft accounts as it relies on Google's poor sync implementations. That's fine. It might work as an app for other people. It doesn't to me. If/Once you add an alternative solution, I'll revisit my review. Until then, I'll use something else.",0
"Ads that cover the whole screen [Later update] Since you bothered to respond to my review I will elaborate: 1. Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google. The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a ""Business Calendar"" app that sends me adds about online games that I can ""skip"" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either. We want stable things that we don't need to upgrade every week or so. 4. Since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed I realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices... And they don't have any adds.",0
"Great, except... it has a serious (and unpredictable) problem displaying events from both Google/Outlook calendars. The events DO show on the Android Google or Outlook calendar apps, so it's NOT an Android sync issue as suggested in another response. Reiterating this point. The calendars ARE synced corrected on Android, just not always displayed. Same behaviour on multiple devices. Sadly, I have to stop using BC.",0
"Does NOT sync with your Google Calendar for events that are more than 30 days old or 365 days forward. Developer responded that the problem is Goggle Calendar, but ALL my events ARE on Google Calendar! I did apply their ""solution "", did not work. Tried again, same result. Sadly cannot use a calendar with missing events! It defeats the whole purpose. Uninstalling!",0
Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.,0
I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view. The current gray color doesn't offer enough contrast when using dark themes. We also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view. Two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year.,0
"My Google Account didn't sync, so I had to delete it and add it anew. Now everything's gone. No backup possible, no export. I loved the app and would love to have it for iphone as well. But not being able to back up any data is pretty annoying. I'm super disappointed, all my appointments are gone!",0
"Worked very well for long time, but since last year it stopped working properly. It does not show events added on my computer, although those I deleted months ago are still in. Very confusing, negatively affecting my planning, as it is literally the only purpose of this app for me to have the schedule up to date when needed urgently.",0
"Recently without any reason, suddenly my task list just failed to sync. I tried reinstalled/re-signed in but didnt work! Emailed the support, they just replied with standard user guide. I have paid for both BC and BC Pro (BC 2), and have been working fine. Google tasks used to synced and easily managed via BC Pro, but not now. If you think you need more funding, you can make it subscription base, and not create another version to sell, and make this one not working! üòû",0
"Understood, my comment was too ambiguous. I would prefer the colors as they were. Seeing several new colors mixed together is difficult.",0
I cannot get it to install on my Microsoft Surface. I have the paid version and am getting a little more than frustrated.,0
"Excellent UI. Easy to use and sync to gmail. Events and tasks all at once. Since the last update on Feb 13, 2020, this app shows video ad. after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished. You have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings.",0
"Unable to remove calendar account. It automatically shows calendars from all accounts on my phone, even though I de-select those, but reappears every time the app is opened! Not at all useful for me. Not WORTH than 1 star. Oops! Update: I know how Android works! But I should have the freedom of choosing which Account to add as other apps let me do! I've 5 Accounts on my device, all having calendar! I just want Calendar from ONLY ONE Account on my device to Show, not All!",0
"This calendar is really good to work with, but recently meetings keep disappearing randomly. The title is still shown in the last used ones, but the entry is gone. All calendars are shown, so the meeting can't be entered in a hidden one. And I don't synchronize with other devices or calendas. Any advices?",0
"Unfortunately I have to change my mind about this calender. I use this app for several years now and the prior version before, but now every now and then the app overerrides all future calender entries in my main calender. I believe it happens when the app gets an update. After the update the app syncs with the calender and overrides the Google calender so that all future entries are deleted.... This is not acceptable. Has this issue been known to be occurring? As for now this app does not work!",0
"Its Feb. 8th and I see the calendar app icon on my phone saying 30... I don't understand, is not updating? I click the icon (open the app) and realized that I never used the app as there I never received any reminds if my scheduled events. In short, this app turned out to be totally useless.",0
i bought business pro a couple of years ago after using the free app for a few years. it's always been fine until recently. all my appointments and notes disappeared when I sync manually with google calendar after the auto sync no longer works about a month ago. No help on the situation since. I am stuck worrying if it will happen again!,0
Please add an option to configure widgets without having to always display the settings button or exporting and importing and manually removing the button again. Edit: How is this helpful when you do not want to display a header and also do not want to see the buttons in it? Also: would be cool to be able to configure the displayed date range of the calendars for widgets. Edit 2: as i described before exporting and importing is cumbersome and it would be way easier through the settings. Agenda,0
"This was great but now only shows me birthdays and bank holidays. It no longer shows events in my personal or work calendars. Went into settings to check they were still activated but I now have to pay ¬£5.99 to access this area as this is now a premium feature. Really?

"EDIT Dec/2022: after many frustrating months trying to understand why event notifications of this app were disappearing after snoozing them or not appearing at all, I contaced their customer service they told me that is an issue with Samsung phones.

"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had.",0
25Dec23-Why would a calendar app need to access another calendar app to do what it is supposed to do? That's just illogical especially when this app wants to access an app I've disabled because I don't like it and can't uninstall it.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î,0
Now absolute garbage. You can sync with calendars BUT THE EVENT DOES NOT MATCH LOCATION. What are you supposed to do pick a location from the many presented? This is so bad that I have had to return to the stock calendar.,0
"Very intrusive ads. Even if it's ""only every 18hs"" it's absolutely annoying and it's full display ads emulating an apps' look. Dark pattern. Very ugly.",0
"ive been using the pro version of this app for over two years and its been great. But, now it doesn't alert me to events. I have changed all the settings in the app and Android to allow alerts and I have adjusted the battery settings to allow background activity by the app, but still no alerts. The alerts only work when I open the app. pointless!",0
"Great features. But, the sync is a nightmare. Regular android calendar syncs instantly. BC2 pro syncs... when it feels like it. Maybe on the 10th sync, maybe not at all. And THAT is the key issue. If i can't put it on my computer, and have my phone get it reliably, it's useless. Editing down to 1 star, because the devs are robots. I don't care what mechanisms you use, the app is not reliable. even if the stock app IS.",0
"Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates. Also the interface and look (big text and colours) looks like a children's calender, while the original version actually looked quite professional.",0
"The features and functionality are pretty good, with support for Google Tasks. BUT the homescreen widget doesn't load at all on Android 9 after restarting the device. One has to remove it and reinstall it, which is a pain. AND the support team was not helpful at all. They went from suggesting a solution which suggested they didn't understand their own app to being completely unresponsive.",0
"I used to love this calendar, but now it has full screen ads/videos that take over your phone. Can't do anything else while the pop-up ad is running. First one of these I saw - UNINSTALLED!! ... Response: The ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely NOT functional while the ads are running - you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again. I can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app, but full length commercials?!",0
"I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.",0
"I liked the calendar until I realized search function is so user unfriendly. It can't even perform a basic search of event name.. really disappointed, have uninstalled since. Edit: I'm not able to open your link and have no intention to as I don't expect an app to require much settings for a simple standard search. This is a feedback, it's either you test it out and try yourself to understand where user is coming from, or leave it. I have since installed aCalendar and am very happy with it.",0
"Was using the original Business Calendar and Tasks apps for years but since they have problems with task synchronisation and don't seem to be supported/developed much any longer, I thought of giving in and switching to Business Calendar 2. Unfortunately, it's far behind the original apps in terms of flexibility and what's more, the tasks sync issues are present here as well. Even the refresh button in the widget doesn't work. Moving to another calendar app.",0
"I regret using it. Well, the apps itself is fine, I have used it for over 6 months. It's easy to navigate. It's not ideal but understandable to have the export calendar function as a pro feature. But then, my phone malfunctioned and I was unable to access this apps. There is no online syncing or a web version so that I can refer back to. edit: I have try the syncing method in FAQ. Most of my calendars are local calendars which I fail to sync or switch them to Google calendar.",0
"Many seconds of full screen commercials when saving new events. Earlier versions were much better, now I need to use another calendar as this is too annoying. The ads are NOT skippable before after 5 seconds, until >> icon becomes clickable! Before this icon shows, there's a waiting circle that gradually builds to indicate required wait time left. Yes, I guess, every day, I experience them. Except last couple of days üôÇ. A few months off, now they're back on last few weeks.",0
"Been great for years. The ads are really annoying. They are long video ones that pop up every single time you add an event. Laughably the response is 'it's only every 18 hours'. Guess how often casual calendar users use the app? I wouldn't mind if it was a short add or i had to watch a video to unlock more actions, but the current cx is super annoying.",0
"Not fully customisable as claimed unfortunately. You used to be able to set it that tapping any date in the widget would open up that month, now it opens the day and when I wrote to the developer they said that'll never change now. The double click feature is buggy, when you click on an adjacent date it still counts it as a double press. There's also no way to turn that off, either, to quote the developer 'this is the design' and that's that.",0
Recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app & I'm unable to add appointments while I wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish. I can no longer use this as its affecting my business. It has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap. Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.,0
"Still regret upgrading to pro. It won't let me drag&drop events because ""events must be synced..."" which they are. It has recently started to not let me edit a single appointment of a series. Getting worse so only one star left. The new update solved none of these issues. Also developer's response is zero helpful. Why can't I edit a single appointment in a series anymore?",0
"Bought the pro version. Linked to Google account. Set up ""period task sync."" Twice now all my tasks have been deleted. No local exported file to be found or online backup...This should be prompted at set up if I've somehow missed something or prior to major updates. I loved to use this app every day for the colour coding tasks and reminders but I can't keep having it reset like this.",0
PRIVACY WARNING: This App now automatically looks up addresses of every event on Google maps. I DID NOT CONSENT to telling Google about my schedule and daily movements. I can find no way of disabling this 'feature'. I do use Google maps at times and I appreciated the quick link to lookup an address in Google maps or my preferred mapping app. I DO NOT LIKE this being done automatically without any warning! ü§¨ This was great App I paid for the pro version and used it for years.,0
"Can't do a backup so I can reinstall on new device! Tried syncing calendar already installed on device, but not happening! Ridiculous.",0
Newly added events aren't showing initially in the widget. I have to go back in and resave for them to appear. Please fixüôè,0
"Not Syncing, was good but sadly it's only showing some of the calendar entries that have been in my Exchange Calendar for a week or so.",0
"This was one of the best apps for free out there but now they added these invasive ads whenever you make a new event in the calendar and some of them are like 30 seconds long. You can't skip them until it's done. This app is now hot garbage. I don't mind ads, they need to make money but 30 second ads about making a social media account, or jump scare ads, or straight up scams is invasive and abhorrent. You guys need to find a different ad service provider.",0
"Worst app ever, dpnt download. It requires premium to Tick a task that is completed ! Like whats the problem? They want us to buy premium. Worst app never download please",0
"Too greedy. Try to collect your data, but not alowed to import/export your own data. Not recommend. You will dependent from them.",0
Had access to all my Gmail calendars the very first time I opened it. Intrusive. Uninvited. I was explicitly looking for a non-native calendar. One I could call the shots on what it had access to. Disappointing. Uninstalled.,0
"I loved this - clear, different views, ability to showmore than one calendar - but it has started not showing all appointments üòï. This is a pretty drastic habit for a calendar. It's not a poor signal issue as previously suggested, as I was using home WiFi. I'm using Outlook calendar. Can you fix this? Reply: resent with Screenshots as requested in subject line. I don't know how to filter as you suggested.",0
"Well it was nice while it lasted. But now it force plays an add every time I try to use it. Also it no longer displays lthe name of each event at the month view, just a blue line for each. Interestingly the previous app I used to use now shows the name of each event. So I'm uninstalling this and going back to the old app.",0
"Nice I guess. But it doesn't display all of my additional calendars under my gmail account. I've enable, enabled/disabled, sync'd dozens of times. I paid for this app. I'm sick to my stomach. Ugh.",0
"so far i have been unable to control what this microphone understands what to do and where to set days and times, time to use and try",0
I'm no longer able to quickly select which calendars to view! This was the best feature of this app. I have about five or six calendars that have numerous all-day event that can clutter of you but being able to quickly deselect them and then reselect them is a feature sorely missed,0
"Hard to edit, too fiddly, notifications not clear and do not repeat. Not helpful to me.",0
"I go to the doctors every two weeks. I noticed recently that the past doctor's appointments have disappeared. The future appointments are still there but the past ones have disappeared I used to like this app. Now., I'm not so sure.",0
"When I downloaded the calander on my new phone, what I had on my old phone I now no longer have access to unless I download the pro version. Not impressed. It's okay, but will be looking at other calanders",0
"I didn't see a trial feature to access full capability, but right away wanted a subscription. I don't approve any business with upfront money then fight them to get it back if not satisfied.",0
Edit: Used to be great but now doesn't show any event older than 1.5 years. * * Just got the Pro version so good it is. Best calendar app out there. Has all the functions and is highly customizable.,0
// edited to respond -- Emails sent 5/15/23 and 5/23/23. No response received for either. Sent to same address as prior communications. Happy to share screen shot of emails sent on these dates -- end edit // No Customer Support? Emailed twice in the past 10 days with a support question. No response was received for either. App has been useless during this time and did not share reminders for meetings and events. Past support has been great. Unfortunate - it was a good app. Need more reliability.,0
"No longer works on Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro since the update, stuck on loading events screen with blue spinning circle. UPDATE: Started working but has stopped again and even a reinstall on both devices hasn't fixed it.. disappointing :-( Can you reply to my email and send me the link to whatever this backup is as I can't see it now I've edited this review?",0
"App worked great for me for years, but I was scheduling an appointment with someone the other day and had to watch an actual video advertisement right in the middle of adding an event. That's a bit much, and reason enough to move on.",0
Does not interface well with phone,0
Never used it,0
I don't like the advertisement keeping pop up and It's hard to turn it off.,0
Outlook office 365 missing.,0
Google calendars dont sync,0
It was fine until I noticed it forced me to have LGB.... month on my calendar and it would not allow me to take it off.,0
"All worked well from a month, and then all events just disappeared... and this is with the fully paid version...",0
The whole point of me getting this calendar was to keep it separate from my personal calendar and use this for my small business You can't have this calendar without allowing them permission to your other calendar which then imports everything from your personal calendar over to this new one completely useless to me apparently. If i needed everything That was on my current calendar transferred over then i would have just stayed using that one. I need a completely separate one duh.. Uninstalled!,0
"worked for years. Now it will not sync with google, despite troubleshooting tips Update: bought the pro version. It does not send out cancelation notices to invited users",0
This has been great the whole time I've used it over the last many years. Recently it has stopped showing the full month in the BC2 month widget. The month widget is the whole reason I use the app and only seeing 2 weeks is not working for me. Please fix this.,0
"Doesn't Actually Sync or Provide Notifications. Can make it look nice. All dressed up looking pretty, while useless functions. Don't allow it to access your Google Calendar unless you want to take half a day fixing what it does to your events and tasks. I couldn't even delete some random holiday calendar from my Google Calendar without temporarily downloading this intrusive app again to find where it was coming from and finally deleting it. I hope I don't keep finding unwanted footprints.",0
My rating was 5 stars for several years until a few days ago. Suddenly the reminders no longer stay active. They disappear. I use this calendar daily and some of the reminders I need to stay all day until I remove them. I am so disappointed. I've written two emails requesting help and have never received a response.,0
"first time opening good experience. Everything from google calendar was synced, then stacked up my events for the day. Opened the app a few hours later and absolutely everything was blank. And you have to pay $7 to be able to drag and drop your events.",0
"Used to be 5 stars, now 2 because of the condescending and nasty responses from customer support when I requested a disability accessibility feature. Dominika, the person who responded MOCKED me for asking for support and called me picky. I was NOT just told to go to the forum, and I'll keep this review up until I receive an apology..",0
21 known trackers in this app. Is that a joke?,0
"I LOVE this app, it has fantastic features and is easy to learn. Because Google has stupid rules around payments, I can't subscribe to the app, and the advertisements are just obnoxious enough to make the app infuriating to use. A real shame. Open up other pathways to subscription!",0
"Overly invasive pop ups. Takes 3 clicks to close and waiting for the timers, so about 30 seconds for any ad after I change anything in my calendar. They don't offer searching for free, it's a paid feature even though Google calendar offers it for free. I only use this because I like the widget but using the app itself is a pain I just use my Google calendar all which is pulls all my info from anyways. I also agree with the others that my events disappear if I try to enter them through the app.",0
"Notification reminders are now triggering late, sometimes an hour or two after the event start time. This is a recent issue that started during February 2024. UPDATE I did not modify any settings since it was working well prior to App updates. I'm using Android 14. However I checked my settings against the help document and they were already correctly set.",0
"Visual ""improvements"" in event creation screen are not improvements at all! It's so ugly now.",0
"This app is awesome, but I have recently been having a lot of trouble with my events getting condensed and pushed to the right up until 4:45 PM. Then, the format goes back to normal. Even if it's only one single event I have slated for the day, it still does this. I have tried everything to fix it. The only thing that works (temporarily) is uninstalling and reinstalling. Which I shouldn't need to do once every day or 2. Please fix this bug.",0
Meh,0
It's a good calender but the weather location is showing weather for some where 60 miles away and I can't change it so it pointless and there's no information online about how to solve this issue.,0
"Its a good calendar, but the ads are highly disruptive. I'd gladly pay for it as a single cost, but it seems this app is using a SASS. Since its not worth paying every month/year for the software I'll just use the default app till something better comes along. Yes the developer has the right to charge what they want. But I also have the right to not purchase it.",0
"Doesn't do what the old one did which was copy and paste events like the old one does. So I've moved back to the old one. Now I've said ""old one"" too many times!",0
"Reduced my rating from a 5 to 2, as the event sync has essentially just stopped working for me at all, making it almost useless. It still allows me to separate my diary, which is nice, but the lack of prompt syncing makes it so much less useful",0
"Address field doesn't work. The house and street numbers, if it's a number street, were interpreted as phone number so it's shown incorrectly on the event. For example, if the address is 123 90 St, Vancouver, it will be shown a phone number of 12390 with a dial icon. The address would be ""St, Vancouver"", which would be completely wrong in Google map. Opening the same event in Google Calendar app would not have this problem.",0
"There are plenty of ads that pop up while you are trying to type something. It is literally impossible to use the app for more than 10 seconds. It would be almost nice as an ACalendar, but because they ask you to buy something continuously, it is not worthy. The price is per year or month is definitely too expensive",0
The last update completely wiped the calendar.. Great job boys.,0
Compared to Google this is cluttery and harder to read. The free version doesn't give access to the settings that would make it bearable and allow for thorough testing. Won't buy if I don't know what it can look like. Also I hear it's subscription based. Also dev is rude to reviewers. At least this app has a lot of settings but without at least a trial I'm not going to waste time.,0
"New app icon harder to see, prefer the old icon. Please bring back!",0
Can't stand for new icon.,0
It deleted all my birthdays for some strange reason. üòï,0

This stopped working. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I have Outlook calendars already on my phone that I cannot access via Business calendar. I seem to be unable to add said calendars to the application as they are already on my phone. I am instead prompted to open up Microsoft word after which nothing appears to happen.,0
"What good is a calendar app if it deletes whatever it chooses to? I have used this app for years. But this last year, I have lost dates that were important for me to remember. Birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, trips, family historical events i wanted to remember pick something. This app has chosen to just drop it from my calendar as if I never even put it in. I would have given it 1 star. But it has kept some things. Looking for new, more dependable calendar app.",0
"Good, but the option to set a default reminder is buggy. My default is ""no notification or email"", and at first setup of an appointment, all looks good - but, after a few hours when I check the appointment again, somehow the ""30min notification and 10min email"" setup default appears for no apparent reason? It is frustrating getting all these unnecessary reminders! Edit to developers: Your reply doesn't help. I don't want external data coming into this calendar.",0
Enough with all these updates. 4 in a week? You need to get the coding right first time and fix ALL the issues before releasing updates. A good app is being ruined by constant bug fix updates! Edit:. NOT part of Beta!,0

"Has great promise, only app that I've seen that will sync Google and MS exchange calendars, but the sync never works and so constantly dissapointing.",0
I liked this at first but why is it not accepting the times? I put the correct time but when I click on the date to check it sometimes the time is an hour off. I've missed appts because of this error. Also the app adds its own holidays on. I don't need to know that's its Easter or Martin Luther kind day. It clogs up my reminder area. Very frustrating.

It's not a poor signal issue as previously suggested, as I was using home WiFi. I'm using Outlook calendar. Can you fix this? Reply: resent with Screenshots as requested in subject line. I don't know how to filter as you suggested.",0
"Good, but the option to set a default reminder is buggy. My default is ""no notification or email"", and at first setup of an appointment, all looks good - but, after a few hours when I check the appointment again, somehow the ""30min notification and 10min email"" setup default appears for no apparent reason? It is frustrating getting all these unnecessary reminders! Edit to developers: Your reply doesn't help. I don't want external data coming into this calendar.",0
"I thought BC2 was going to be very good for my multiple personal projects. It looked well developed, and at first its help looked good.  But I had to abandon it because its help turned out to be useless -- it never mentioned any issue I needed answered as a learner of the program.  Thus I just could not learn the program.  The help may be better for other people.",0
"I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. ¬£6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!",0
I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app! But they have recently added add on videos (skippable but still 5 seconds long.. ) after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app. It's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule... You've went to far Business Calendar 2...,0
"Completely stops syncing, every month or so. Each time, I try manually syncing, clearing cache & data, cleaning up my phone storage, but... nothing. This happens to me all the time. I have to completely uninstall & re-install, but even then it only syncs for about a month until I have to do it all again. I have many calendars on my google account, with many thousands of events... maybe this app just can't handle that amount of data? Who knows. Promising app otherwise. It would be great if this app had a 3 week view (or customizable range) - that would make it literally the ONLY calendar app that had an option somewhere between a Two Week view (too sparse) and a Month view (too dense).",0
"Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts.",0
"I've used this calendar app for many many years, and loved it. Now suddenly the ads stop me from finishing my tasks, and I have to wait for the X to appear. That's fine for games, but this is a serious app I use when booking and planning life and I don't need it to interrupt my thought process as that causes me to lose focus and forget things, which is exactly why I need a reliable calendar app.",0
"On my previous phones, this was the best ever calendar, because of its widgets (the week view no-one else has)! However, since I changed my phone to the Samsung s21fe for some reason the calendar app has stopped syncing up with my work account and I have to manually sync it and restart the widget to get the updated agenda. I've missed several meetings because of this!",0
"I really wish I could make this calendar work, as I am a big fan of it. Unfortunately, it stopped syncing with my Google Calendar and so it has become unusable. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times, cleared data, but still no events showing up from my Google Calendar. Edit: tried your solution but unfortunately when I removed and re-added my accounts now they don't show up at all in the app. I tried another app and it syncs fine.",0
"It was good but I guess Google is sabotaging it, so I lost a couple of notifications. Removed it and started using Google calendar and notifications are now ok. Sorry.  I have uninstalled the program since I missed an important appointment I can no longer trust it.  Probably the solution you provide works, but I think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesn't miss appointments.",0
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.,0
"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!",0
"The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me.",0
"lately been worse. latest updates have been making things worse. like when you edit the time for the event, the new way to do it is absolutely terrible and least user friendly way to select times. it was perfect and smooth before idk what changed. also no response from support for weeks now about bugs I have with notifications clearing when they should not be",0
Constant problemw with Microsoft accounts,0
"This app is awesome, but I have recently been having a lot of trouble with my events getting condensed and pushed to the right up until 4:45 PM. Then, the format goes back to normal. Even if it's only one single event I have slated for the day, it still does this. I have tried everything to fix it. The only thing that works (temporarily) is uninstalling and reinstalling. Which I shouldn't need to do once every day or 2. Please fix this bug.",0
"Overly invasive pop ups. Takes 3 clicks to close and waiting for the timers, so about 30 seconds for any ad after I change anything in my calendar. They don't offer searching for free, it's a paid feature even though Google calendar offers it for free. I only use this because I like the widget but using the app itself is a pain I just use my Google calendar all which is pulls all my info from anyways. I also agree with the others that my events disappear if I try to enter them through the app.",0
"Its a good calendar, but the ads are highly disruptive. I'd gladly pay for it as a single cost, but it seems this app is using a SASS. Since its not worth paying every month/year for the software I'll just use the default app till something better comes along. Yes the developer has the right to charge what they want. But I also have the right to not purchase it.",0
"Doesn't Actually Sync or Provide Notifications. Can make it look nice. All dressed up looking pretty, while useless functions. Don't allow it to access your Google Calendar unless you want to take half a day fixing what it does to your events and tasks. I couldn't even delete some random holiday calendar from my Google Calendar without temporarily downloading this intrusive app again to find where it was coming from and finally deleting it. I hope I don't keep finding unwanted footprints.",0
It started strong then the ads were a bit much but it's free and I was thinking about buying it. Then‚Ä¶ Events that are clearly on my Google calendar stopped showing. Suddenly. Yes they‚Äôre still on Google and show on that app. I don't like that app but I might be stuck with it. I'm sorry this didn't last but I am glad the problem developed before I bought it.,0
"This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted. Reply to reply: I know I can pay to get them removed but I don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close.",0
"I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app.",0
Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity. I used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now I won't.,0
"I used to love this app. It worked flawlessly for me and it was my go-to calendar app. However, recently I am having trouble where it does not sync anything other than my single Outlook calendar, with my other calendars being visible from my phone, but not having the events also populate on my laptop. This is a huge problem for me and definitely a deal breaker. If this can't be resolved I'll have to start looking elsewhere for a calendar. It still is a nice calendar app, but if you want seemless integration between your phone and your laptop, look elsewhere.",0
"Tasks are no longer syncing with Google Calendar. Therefore they do not sync between devices. Lowered rating from 5 to 2 stars. I'm trying to respond to the Developer. Their comment doesn't show up in the edit pop up so I'm not sure where it will be when I submit this. I have been using Business Calendar since I got my original Droid about a decade ago. Once I decided that I liked the way that it worked, I paid for the pro upgrade. When Business Calendar 2 came out I installed it along side Business Calendar Pro to keep the pro features without an additional payment. I also installed both programs on an Android Tablet. Everything synced with Google Calendar and tasks showed up on both devices. The only issue was that if you entered a repeating task on one device and marked it complete on the other the repetitive task was not created. I realise that this is a Google problem, but you could probably pass this information in the description field if you wanted an enhancement. I recently got a new phone. That is when the tasks quit syncing. I think that a newer version of the apps were installed on the phone than I had been using. I also upgraded the apps on the tablet to see if that would fix the problem. I have just uninstalled the apps from both devices, deleted the tasks from Google Calendar in a web browser, and reinstalled the apps on both devices. I recreated several repeating tasks on the phone. They did not sync to Google Calendar.",0
"This is app is something that I use only because I cannot find something better to fit my scheduling needs. The amount of bugs in the app and the amount of ads I have to sit through is beyond annoying. Not sure why they keep pushing for me to purchase something that consistently screws up because of the bugs. The biggest bug being adding in birthdays or anything that has a date, as instead of putting the date I requested it will put it a day behind or a day beforehand.",0
"Checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single, scrollable homescreen widget. --- Unfortunately, although the app has the option to repeat a task ""from the completion date,"" the functionality is broken.  For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the ""Thursday"" and the ""from completion date."" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work.",0
"I have the paid version of this app and it keeps, somehow, going back to the free version. I continue losing my calendar inputs. The widget frequently gets stuck at on the wrong day and date of the week and won't update unless you remove the widget and reinstall. I have been screwed over because of these issues so many times. It's a calendar widget, why does it have so many issues?! Edit: it does these after a few weeks and yes it has access to everything",0
"This is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone (data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone )and that is only reason i cant trust this app. I am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app. Anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example. Again, by far it is a very very good calendar app.",0
This stopped working. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I have Outlook calendars already on my phone that I cannot access via Business calendar. I seem to be unable to add said calendars to the application as they are already on my phone. I am instead prompted to open up Microsoft word after which nothing appears to happen.,0
I really liked the app but now I'm going to have to find something else. They have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive. I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate. It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.,0
Would have been nice to explore more features without having to go pro right out of the gate. I'm not down to pay for something that supposedly works without trying it for myself. Could have easily enabled more options that entices the user other than the bare bones vs. I'll stick with Google for the time being,0
"Since updating to Android 11 it does not regularly sync with my Google Calendar. I think my last successful sync was 3 days ago at this point. To address the problem, I even tried the nuclear option and completely reset my phone from scratch. It went back to not syncing after a few days. Dev responded re: app killing and sync. I used dev options to disable process killing with no change. This app doesn't sync with Google's calendar properly. My default calendar app updates, so it's only this app",0
I liked this at first but why is it not accepting the times? I put the correct time but when I click on the date to check it sometimes the time is an hour off. I've missed appts because of this error. Also the app adds its own holidays on. I don't need to know that's its Easter or Martin Luther kind day. It clogs up my reminder area. Very frustrating. I can't change it in settings,0
"UPDATE: I know it's a one time fee as stated, that I had already paid. Same acct now I don't have pro. I've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away. My reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me I do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment. üò† Also, if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful! Disappointed that I would have to pay for pro again if I wanted to continue those features.",0
"Loved this app, but recently noticed I really was't hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason, although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100% system volume for notifications, this version (BC2) sounds half as loud, if that, to the point it's unusable because I rarely hear them. UPDATE: Just realized that for some odd reason BC2 calendar notification volume is mapped/linked to Ringtone volume and I had that lower than half volume. Please fix this.",0
Food app but keeps defaulting payment to the wrong google account when I try to buy the pro version. Super annoying. I uninstalled a few times and downloaded it again. Made sure that each time it was with the correct google account. Still having the same issue.,0
"The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place.",0
"This app just ""disappeared"" two of the recent events I listed in, both weddings. Luckily I thought of rechecking a day after inputting them. This has happened a couple of times already. Too unreliable for work appointments, I might get fired when I rely on this app's widget for work appointments. Close to uninstalling, after I check out a good replacement",0
It was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry.... How to annoy your users ! I won't be forced to pay... I have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback! Good luck,0
"Don't like it much Event, Task, Favorites at the bottom confusion. Entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them. Need simple customization features and I HATE the computer time task settings which it uses. pros easy to read overview. Thx. mbf",0
"Edit: Thank you for your response. I didn't email under this name. I emailed under another name - Kate Everward. No answers yet. the guide you gave me is isn't helping. Frustrating. I bought the pro version. Cant sync the phone and pc apps and no one is responding. I asked for help and the support service disappeared. The app itself is good but if I cant link them, I cant use them. I'm about to delete this thing and go back to Gmail unfortunately.",0
I'm no longer able to quickly select which calendars to view! This was the best feature of this app. I have about five or six calendars that have numerous all-day event that can clutter of you but being able to quickly deselect them and then reselect them is a feature sorely missed,0
"I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads. If that is not reverted soon, I will have to change app. Pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job.

Edit: Used to be great but now doesn't show any event older than 1.5 years. * * Just got the Pro version so good it is. Best calendar app out there. Has all the functions and is highly customizable.,0
"App worked great for me for years, but I was scheduling an appointment with someone the other day and had to watch an actual video advertisement right in the middle of adding an event. That's a bit much, and reason enough to move on.",0
I liked the app but was getting issues with the widget not refreshing. I reached out to the support team but they weren't interested as they stopped sending me a response. Disappointing. I now use Google calendar as I can't trust a company who are not interested in fixing problems with their app.,0
"I liked this app for the task list widget up until recently. Features that used to be standard are now premium. I am considering uninstalling if this gives me enough trouble, because I am not suddenly paying for something that I had for free for months.",0
Would be great but almost everything you need to customize it when you first install it is pro only. You can't customize font settings - it's pro. You can't import old calendars - it's pro. How am I supposed to start using your app then?,0
Overall a great app to replace both Google calendar app and Microsoft Outlook app. Only thing stopping me from purchasing a Pro licence that has super useful and amazing features is the fact that there is no windows desktop app. ‚òπÔ∏è,0
Great features and easy to use but have uninstalled it as I get constant messages that it is using intensive amount of battery in the background.... Which it is was. Battery life much improved with it gone. Such a shame.,0
"I used to love this but now I need to pay an insane amount or have both the Pro and free versions both on my phone. ""If you already have purchased the old Business Calendar Pro, you just have to keep it installed on your device to activate all the pro features of Business Calendar 2. Unfortunately we have no possibility to automatically check, if you are a pro user of BC 1. We can only check, if the old BC Pro app currently is installed on your device. """,0
"The ads have become increasingly annoying by going full page where you have to wait for it to do it's thing before you can even get into the calendar. I'm all for supporting ads, but these kinds of ads that take over are the worse. And the family sharing doesn't work for this app, so will start looking for something else to use.",0
I have bought premium yesterday. It does not work to sync between laptop and phone. It can be synced only task not events. And I can see only task list by email I saved in laptop or phone. Anyway it is so hard and Unconfortable. So I think it has a problem to sync and I hope it will be developed soon if it is possible.,0
Buggy as hell. Keeps duplicating events when I edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side. I keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back. I'm irritated and I'm going to look elsewhere now. I loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go.,0

"Good program, but the ads are becoming *super* intrusive. Been using for years, but I'm considering changing to something else. Edit to dev response: The ads are *not* skippable Edit #2: no, they are not, until you sit through them. Taking off a star for lying developer.",0
"No longer works on Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro since the update, stuck on loading events screen with blue spinning circle.

"Actually it is a good calendar app, but on Android 10 Google calendars cannot be synched without the Google Calendar app installed on your device. You have to sync your calendar by another calendar app, or all your BC2 events will stay on your local device only. So this means, that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app, which makes this app useless at the moment. I am waiting for a fix.",0
"This calendar was great until the ads. They are out of control, you can not go back, the x button does not work, and they are way more often than ever 18hrs as stated by the maker. If you can get past the crazy ads then its great but, I am over it and can't handle it anymore.",0
"A glorified ""stock calendar"", as Tech Support calls it (the native Calendar app). Forget it if you have an Outlook calendar; notwithstanding what appears on the app, only Exchange is supported. Seems they spent more time on bells and whistles than the underlying architecture of the app",0
"Main issues to solve: 1) in the icon app there isn't the indication of current day. Would be very useful to have it instead of the standard BC violet icon 2) there isn't the possibility to set two different time zone in the fields ""from"" and ""to"" in the same event. It would be very useful to set fights event with different time zone. 3)the location link should be synchronised with Google maps results, not with the contacts, in order to have the right response for the addresses. Please update",0
"Recently, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year disappeared from this calendar. Appgenix is convinced that it is a Google problem and they will not be fixing it (Google calendar has no missing holidays).

"Doesn't sync properly anymore. Have been using the free version of this calendar app with my Google calendar for years without problems. But for the last half year or so, the appointments don't sync, the invites don't get sent. It has become unusable and unreliable. I have had to switch to the Google calendar app now.",0
"The cheap Samsung calendar that came with my phone is able to auto populate addresses phone numbers and other details from previous calendar events, but this paid app is unable to do that so I have to type in addresses and phone numbers, etc. Every single time. It is a huge time waste.",0
"Have been using this app for years and have loved it. However, a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it. I do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years. But with full screen ads, NO, sorry.",0
"Would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible. Those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games, but stopping what I'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable. I understand the banner ads to keep it running, but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far.",0
My rating was 5 stars for several years until a few days ago. Suddenly the reminders no longer stay active. They disappear. I use this calendar daily and some of the reminders I need to stay all day until I remove them. I am so disappointed. I've written two emails requesting help and have never received a response.,0
"Well it was nice while it lasted. But now it force plays an add every time I try to use it. Also it no longer displays lthe name of each event at the month view, just a blue line for each. Interestingly the previous app I used to use now shows the name of each event. So I'm uninstalling this and going back to the old app.",0
"The app does not synchronize events and tasks correctly with Google calendar. Often the changes I made on my desktop computer are not displayed in the app until the next day, or do not synchronize at all until I manually request BC to sync.

Happy to share screen shot of emails sent on these dates -- end edit // No Customer Support? Emailed twice in the past 10 days with a support question. No response was received for either. App has been useless during this time and did not share reminders for meetings and events. Past support has been great. Unfortunate - it was a good app. Need more reliability.,0
"Agree with others that have made comments about the syncing. I've used this for years and it has never had an issue. Then pretty much overnight a few weeks or a maybe a month back something has changed. It may be and probably is a google issue, but it still makes it unusable.",0
I used to really love this app as it provides a Todo list widget that can show a lot of Todo list items compacted into a very small space. However it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so I'm going to be looking for a replacement.,0
Use to love this app as I've had it for well over a year. Just recently it magically deleted all my appointments with no way of getting them back. Tried everything from resetting to reinstalling no resolution. I paid for the app so was a little disappointed that I have to look for another app and reenter all my appointments (20+ a day),0
"Doesn't hold settings. I set it for 5-day view and it goes to 1-day every time I open it. I've had Business Calendar Pro for close to 10 years and it's great, so I'll keep using it. Thought this one might have more features, but it's not even doing the basics right.",0
"Great app, but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant. I wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated. While using the App I get 40 notifications because it updates my personal calendar as well. I gave 2 stars because otherwise the functionality and UI is really nice.",0
"Does not sync. If i enter an item in the agenda. It does not sync with the widget. Sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget. In the widget only 2 items are visable. The rest keep saying ""loading"" for days now. Even if i manually sync.",0
"You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying?

Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad,0
This has been great the whole time I've used it over the last many years. Recently it has stopped showing the full month in the BC2 month widget. The month widget is the whole reason I use the app and only seeing 2 weeks is not working for me. Please fix this.,0
Migrating to a new phone was completely messed-up. All my tasks were changed to all day tasks and all appointments hours were lost! Unacceptable errors!!!

forces to buy premium after adding only 7 habits!!,0
"Premium thing added in it, only limited things we can track",0
Does not sync across devices,0
The alarm for reminder never worked for me. Fully disappointed after buying the premium version.,0
One of the recurring tasks I set for myself disappeared on its own. I didn't delete it. Now I can't track the days on which I did this task. This is very unpleasant.,0
I want to use it in my Mobile phone as well as in my Tablet. But unable to recover the license. Can anyone help please?,0
"Since I cannot edit my review, you're wrong. My alarm showed up on my screen. Fullscreen, but no sound. So it wasn't of much help.",0
Wants to charge you for using a task checklist. Instant uninstall,0
Limitation on no of tasks,0
I m not getting any reminder and alarms only they r set and I need to open the app I see them I want the reminder and alarms as notification,0

They keep changing small features that make the habits harder to use. Specifically The notes which I used to use to add things like prayers and details and now don't even show up when the habits are created. It's just annoying and there's no reason for the change. Each update it's just the small little things that add up and make this app kind of annoying to use.,0
Money deducted but haven't been upgraded to premium.....plz address the issue asap,0
"This thing is very stupid. When I want to create backup to my habits, I cannot choose the format of backup file. I have to go with stupid format .hn that no one use but HabitNow app. If this problem didn't solved I will not recommend this app to my followers anymore.",0
"The app has all the disciplinary actions to take right, but the big issue is they don't notify one at all. Since I downloaded the app, I haven't been notified to do anything at all.. It's just silent, I am the one to do my tasks myself without prior notification from the app. So what's the use, I will uninstall the app right now!",0
Thought it would be good. Unbelievable limited for the free version...another money grubber app.,0
"at the beginning it's the best application for tracking my habits, but now I don't know why it refuses us to program no more than 2 habits (at least limit the habits to 7 but 2 habits frankly the application is on the verge of become useless to me) I no longer recognize this app, it is no longer what it was.

Could be cheaper,0
only let's you have 5 tasks without paying for it.,0
This app was good until I couldn't do anything anymore because I need premium and to me that's just nonsence. For an app that just tracks habits? No thanks.,0
I do not want this app this app is not good,0
Too many things locked behind premium doesn't make me want to use any version,0
Why should I become premium to get normal features? Why should I become premium to backup my data??? Why should I become premium to click on the done button from the widget?? And the price is very expensive for a habit tracker app!! The app is awful,0

Small number of habits before you have to pay.,0
I am trying to buy premium version. The app is forcing me to add card first and not allowing to pay without adding card.

Can only add 6 recurring activities before having to pay,0

Too many basic functions locked behind premium,0
"Frustrating. I thought it was good at first but I'd you don't set the specific day for the year ahead of of time it doesn't let you log anything. Like if I workout on a Tuesday intsread of Wednesday I can't log it. And your weekly schedule changes at all it wipes your data, or it will show in one place but not the calender and you can't access it or makes changes outside of that day. You also can't look back at different day. End up deleting it, I was so frustrated with it.",0
Your app's notification is not working,0
Why can't I upgrade to premium?,0
Loved it at first but absolutely detest the very small recurring task limit.,0
Not sending notifications,0

"This app set off my phones vibrations as the alarm but did not stop until I deleted the app...weirdest thing, so no I will not be using this app again.",0
alarm problem.. Kindly solve it...,0
"So stupid that I have to delete a task if I put an alarm on it and I don't want the alarm to glitch out and wake me up when I turn off the reminder part. The fact the alarms have a built in snooze that forces you to have to constantly snooze the alarm instead of being able to just turn it off. If I check mark the task it should stop the alarm, what's the point in having check marks if they do nothing",0
There is no way to input what times your habits and tasks are supposed to be completed at each day just a reminder/notification option and that isn't very helpful if you can't input the start and end time for each activity so this is a completely useless app. This is basically nothing more than a glorified checklist and I wish I realized that before paying for premium,0
"Useless app, even basic features such as a dark mode widget and check box feature on widgets are reserved for premium users. Uninstalling right away!",0
Another thing to keep up with,0
It only lets you set up 5 trackers before it requires you to pay. It's kind of pointless to have a free version for basically no app.,0
Unable to upload to premium in Google play. Please allow apk in your website as alternative method.,0
Not what I wanted,0
"I was really Surprised at how easy and smooth this app works it is fantastic no disturbance just get on with your work, I highly recommend this app",0
Ininstalled immediately. The widget isn't available unless you make a ~$5 one time purchase to premium. Disappointed. App store description doesn't list premium features. Was so excited to find an app with widget availability. :(,0
Sometimes notification stops automatically,0
"Edit: App update is out, one-click tracking is still not supported... Old Review: App works fine. Unfortunately some promised features are not being added (like one-click tracking of multi step habits). Last update is roughly 6 month old. Seems dead overall.",0

Worst app. Purely money minded. Able to add only 7 items to checklist for free. How 7 is enough for a day.,0
Authors should have read at least a book about building habits before making the app.,0
Adds habits in reverse order with no way to reorder the daily list,0
Two words: It stinks üò†üò†üò†üò†,0
Not happy that you need to pay for most of the tools. You can't properly use the app without buy prim,0
"You're better off using the alarms/clock app that comes with your phone. No way of checking notes added to habits or tasks and the layout to set them up is jus confusing and pointless.

I would like to put mine in the order that I do them throughout the day, and none of your sorting allows that. Thanks!

Can't even get into a habit to check the app to check my habits. I ended up getting into a habit of closing notifications and NOT checking the app. More research needs to be done around positive habit forming and also slowely getting you into the habit. No point just popping up a notification that that is the same each time. Needs to be a reward to get you into a habit and to use the app. That way I'll actually pay for premium. It's depressing for me.,0
You can't re order habits and tasks. I need things to be in the right order or else I won't do them. There should be a 3 line icon to reorganize habits and tasks This is a basic feature to have in any app. Disappointed.,0

I wish I could give zero stars..what nonsense is that.. you can track only 6-7 habits. I can do that in my journal. Uninstalling now,0
Checking off habits or tasks is paywalled. Clicking on the widget at all tries to sell you the app. Worthless.,0
I m not getting any reminder and alarms only they r set and I need to open the app I see them I want the reminder and alarms as notification,0
I can only add 4-5 habits that's it otherwise I have to purchase it then I can add more .... Duuhhh!!!,0
Notifications don't turn after mobile restart. Disappointed to be a premium member.,0
All the features are great...bt you guys are limiting how many habits i can add for the free version? nd the limit is only 7 ...very nice of u... from now on I'll do only 7 sets of work everyday...üëç at least make the limit 15... you guys make apps just to earn some bucks...,0
Worst app. Purely money minded. Able to add only 7 items to checklist for free. How 7 is enough for a day.,0
"It's not enough of free habits, they could charge for something else, not for core feature of app",0
I want to use it in my Mobile phone as well as in my Tablet. But unable to recover the license. Can anyone help please?,0
Wants to charge you for using a task checklist. Instant uninstall,0
It is best and easy to use,0
It's says Error when copying data when I tried to export data. Can you please mail me the solution again Please,0
"Good interface, works well, but you need to pay to build a good routine, so no ty.",0
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy.",0
It makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE that you have a limit (unless you pay) of Habits you can add. I wasn't even able to put my daily routine in before hitting the limit. Immediately uninstalled,0
How to set end date of a task? Sometimes 3 days meeting is a task. But habitnow can't have the option to select task ending date.,0
Alarm and reminders are not working. I am using this application from last 2 weeks. I am using vivo smartphone.,0
"I got the premium version The main drawbacks of this app are: 1- I cannot customize the categories 2- If I do a task earlier, it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3- removing done tasks is not available Just moved to the bottom",0
"Reminders don't have this news option. In order for any habit app to be useful, I need to be able to snooze reminders that I can't do at this moment.",0
"Not what I was looking for. I paid for the premium app and it's not what I had in mind. A lot of free appa are giving the same experience. It's only been few days, can I get a refund? Would appreciate it, if i can get a refund.",0
"The app is good but the limit to the amount of habits you can make wastes its potential. There's a lot others that premium has that the free version doesn't, so why a limit?",0
"I tried everything and followed every instruction, still doesn't alarm. That's for u guys to find out. I just reviewed what's my experience using the app.",0
It doesn't allow you to set a specific time which kind of defeats the purpose of building a habit if you're doing them chaotically all throughout the day.,0
This app doesn't remind you about habit/task until you open the app and the battery optimization was switched on but still i face the same issue.,0
There should have sound to select for our new tasks and habits so that I could track what is this for because sometimes I think it's message but no it's task that I could not do at the right time,0
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.,0
"This thing is very stupid. When I want to create backup to my habits, I cannot choose the format of backup file. I have to go with stupid format .hn that no one use but HabitNow app. If this problem didn't solved I will not recommend this app to my followers anymore.",0
"If you give 10 habits creating system in free version.it will be better.but you should not give under 10 habits system in this app .lest useless app maybe.so,be careful it. and tasks priority shorting system, and priority show on task or habits screen have to add .then,it will be better app.",0
Beware. I left a 1 star review explaining that this app is a money grabber that wants you to pay in order to be able to check tasks as completed and today that review is missing. There are 100s of other apps that are %100 free. Don't waste your time with this,0
"Couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages, episodes, and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu.. The only way to edit a habit is to delete it.",0
I got the app because I just got a job and my memory issues effect a lot. I didn't get through the morning routine before I told I need to get premium. I WOULDNT advise someone to use,0
"I have bought the premium version of the app, but I am unable to see the feature upgrade in app. Help me with what should be done.",0
"This app set off my phones vibrations as the alarm but did not stop until I deleted the app...weirdest thing, so no I will not be using this app again.",0
I am your premium member... Your app all features is very good but lack of manual sorting feature in todo section. Please in next update include this feature. It is very important thing bcz user can set priority in their task and habit.,0
"Useless app, even basic features such as a dark mode widget and check box feature on widgets are reserved for premium users. Uninstalling right away!",0
Very bad you have to pay after like 10 tasks,0
SCAM This absolute scam of an app made me setup everything up just to find out they limit number of habits for non premium users. Total scam and waste of time.,0
Cant create recurring task fro every hour,0
"Tried purchasing the premium version, amount has been debited from my bank account but premium version is still locked despite a successful checkout.",0
Screen Lock Issue! Timer screen stops working after unlocking after time is completed.,0
I just cannot be notified. Please. Fix it. So I could give 5 stars.,0
"I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless.",0
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet,0
"Ads too frequent, didn't even finish setting up first days tasks",0
"Too complicated, wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task.",0
"Ugh. Has lots of potential and would be very serviceable for some but not me. And, I didn't realize this until after I had signed up for the seven day trial. For the life of me, I cannot find how to cancel it. Can somebody send me in the right direction?",0
"DON'T download. After installation my calendar was FULL of commercials! ""You won an iPhone"" events with alarms.",0
Update Broke The App. It now crashes whenever I try to swipe to a different tab. My 5 star review is now sadly a 1.,0
Don't download this app. This app isn't easy to use plus the subscription or one time payment are too expensive.,0
"This looks like a good app, unfortunately, the US calendar (starting weeks on a Sunday) makes the app completely unusable for me.",0
"Seems like if I don't want to follow that junk on Instagram, I get - 15 points. Instant uninstall.",0
"Awesome app, very well developed, but p2w and too expensive where I live. Poor country. Sorry. Can't pay.",0
"Notifications don't work, even with the ""set reminder"" option it won't tell me there's something I have to do",0
"Ap posters me to join their Instagram and no way of saying ""no, I don't even have instagram"" it will just pester you constantly The app would not let me delete the task",0
I like the new design. But the app is crashing every now and then after the update.,0
Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.,0
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.,0
It doesn't even load. It just stays on the I'm screen. White screen with the icon picture in the middle.,0
The quality of the app is very low and slow and it has ads. There are many problems.,0
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.,0
"Between tasks randomly failing without any input and undoing failed tasks creating fake duplicate tasks that cannot be deleted, this app is too buggy to use for its intended purpose.",0
I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.,0
I cancelled my subscription after getting the trial but apparently it re enabled it and it charged ne and now I can't get a refund. App is a scam and robbed me,0
Too complicated UI design. I just need a mindless tracker,0
"‚ùå=DO NOT USE THIS APP if you need reminder notifications as they DO NOT WORK even with app visable on screen, let alone in the background! ‚ùå=App is pointless as DOES NOT STAY ALIVE IN MEMORY! ‚ùå=Ignore reviews from users who HAVE NOT TESTED THE APP! ‚ùå=You cannot set a notification after task start time so NO WAY TO CONFIRM TASK COMPLETION! ‚ùå=Widget DOES NOT UPDATE! ‚ùå=Dev NOT INTERESTED IN FIXING- complaints still exist since app creation! ‚ùå=Many better apps to use instead- THIS APP DOES NOT WORK!",0
"Super cool if you're a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars. If you're a woman, I hope you want to be a nun, a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy, or part of a couple. Not even kidding. Definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas.",0
Was pretty good but it made it impossible for me to cancel yearly subscription,0
Pretty good however it still need a lot of improvements,0
Too many nonsensical preloaded tasks.,0
Not very intuitive,0
Crashes on android 4.4 (miui 9),0
Couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am,0
notification not working,0
"For creating tasks, it's too much...",0
"Good in theory, but it's so irritating to get it to do what you want",0
Is retarded to think someone is getting a schedule app with no calendar included in itself,0
Way over priced for the full version...,0
didn't really work that well,0
Annoying premium offers pop up.,0
"Only just discovered there's a bit of a, sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted",0
Erases subtasks after an hour or two. Useless.,0
Latest update makes the widget not working,0
why the display name has to be 5 characters long? what about people with 4 or 3 letter names? xD this is ridiculous,0
The pop up adverts are so loud ... Terible !,0
Can't use calendar unless you subscribe. Uninstalled.,0
"We just wanted a simple checklist, not a real life character sheet",0
"App keeps shutting down, this is encountered after the previous update üò≠",0
This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.,0
The app sends too many notifications with annoying sound üò°,0
Unable to install in pixel 7 Android 14,0
Really? I have to subscribe to use the *bed icon*???? The one it has automatically set up for one of the first tasks??????,0
"Looks really complicated, and it's entirely prescription based. I felt like I needed to take a class to learn it. There are a lot of apps like this. I'll try another one.",0
There are free apps available that are much better and more effective. Subscribed to the trial version and without notifying me they deducted annual subscription charges from my account. I even cancelled the subscription immediately and asked for refund but haven't received any response. Unethical and quite disappointing. The developers are money hungry who don't care about their customers.,0
"I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless.",0
could you please add the option to move the tasks it's unbelievable that a app this good does not have the option to move the tasks and every thing is stuck I want to organize the task my way not using a filter how much do I need to pay for you to implement this change ? if you do this I'll give you a 5 star and pay lifetime plus a big bonus.,0
Does not work. Will not let me turn on notifications despite it shutting off my podcast with a notification even thoughy phone it set to silent. The toggle is frozen. No other app is affected. Clicking the toggle does nothing and the app locks me out with a pop up requesting a permission I can't grant. Phone is up to date software wise. Not sure whats wrong. Looked promising too. Guess I'll need to uninstall and wait to see if it gets fixed.,0
Tested on 4 Android versions and devices: 1‚Ä¢ Reminders only work with screen on & app in foreground (app doesn't stay in memory!) 2‚Ä¢ Can't rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom. 3‚Ä¢ Every notification 'Perform' button click= annoying popup to confirm AGAIN- can't be disabled!! 4‚Ä¢ Needs option for notification X minutes AFTER task start/end (Users need notification to inform what to start PLUS notification option to confirm it's done (at the task end time.)) Subscibe when fixed!,0
"Doesn't work at all - as a developer myself, it's clear they don't know what they're doing. It should have every possible one but doesn't have ANY broadcast receivers or persistant notification to keep it alive from Android oom freeing up memory which explains no-one receiving notifications as seen in other reviews. Even when active, notifications only received upon screen on despite battery optimization execlusion or doze completely disabled with root. 5 stars and will subscripe once fixed.",0
"UNUSABLE and BADLY DESIGNED due to being full of confirmation POP-UPS and BUGS. EVERYTHING you do or don't do in and out of the app is followed by dozens of POINTLESS pop-ups which causes the app to CONSTANTLY CRASH! e.g. there's no need to confirm notification button presses! Once there's an option to disable all pop-ups, this rating can be updated to 5 stars and all of us can subscribe to premium. Let's see if the developer is interested in fixing and receiving more subscription revenue",0
Completely broken app. The auto fail system keeps spamming on the same task. I've lost all my levels and gold. When you undo a failed task in the task execution screen it doesn't even give back the same amount of skill xp. I paid for premium and I'm very disappointed I can't even use this app anymore.,0
"Locking the dark mode theme behind a paywall is not a user-friendly decision. A theme, especially something as basic as dark mode, is not a functionality. I'd use the app more with dark mode to test and determine if the premium features are worth investing in. Please consider making it accessible to all users.",0
"It gives you a set of random tasks and you can't remove them. I tried to remove them so I could set my own and it just removed them from one day and subtracted a bunch of gold from my character. Customization is kind of important for an app like this, but I guess the creator disagrees.",0
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!",0
"With one of the recent updates intrusive Ads have been introduced. While I totally get that ad-free will not finance the effort of development, this kind of Ads (ad video autoplaying full screen every 4(!!) task ticks) is totally inacceptable. I was about to give a good rating and buying plus soon, but this killed it for me. Sad.",0
"This app will create a ""Review my tasks"" reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to ""5 hours before"". This can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound. It ignores the Do not disturb mode of the phone. It fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night.",0
"All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics.",0
"The app is great, I love it. However, I'm giving it one star because there is a bug that is breaking my workflow! After the last update, Everytime that I go to the task list section in order to search for a specific task, and click the magnifying glass button, the application closes automatically. I cannot search for a task after this :(",0
"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.",0
"The constant ""turn on notifications"" popup made me uninstall this immediately after testing it out. It seems fine if you want notifications on, but there is no way to turn it off without it making the app frustrating to use. Ive found with these types of apps the notifications come at the worst times and are distracting, so i do not want them on at all. Seems counterintuitive when the app is meant to help accomplish tasks, to force a distraction during them.",0
"Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with.",0
"I love this app! So much that I opted to pay for the permanent subscription. There's just one thing that I don't find great. No Google calendar integration, and no dedicated calendar widget. I could survive of either of these two features existed, but not having either makes it a pain to use. When I schedule tasks, I now have to duplicate them in my Google calendar. What a hassle! I emailed the developer, and got no response whatsoever, so I'm hoping they at least read the reviews!",0
"Could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription. Update: your calling THEMES an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one.... Sorry but changing the background color to black, which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature, it's about one line of code. I'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two. Same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality. Check out Notion for a great example.",0
"Way overcomplicated for a simple To Do List app. You need to create a task, search through the extremely limited icons, set the XP and coins you get from it, set the XP and coins you lose if you miss it, set all the skills you improve, set the percentages of how much for all of the above, set the reoccurance (which is about 3 steps in and of itself), turn on notifications, tell it WHEN to notify, and finally, save it. For every single task. That's not even getting into the premium features yet.",0
"I can't add any new task for the next days. Every time I select ""daily"", it resets it to ""today only"". That task only shows up today. What's the use of being so custom if I can't add my own tasks for the day? Unless I add the ""routine"" thing, it doesn't work. I should be able to have any ""resolutions"" for the following day, not just the preset ones, right? It's like nothing I do is even saved. Not to mention the disaster your translation site is.",0
Makes me sign in but then doesn't carry over information across devices. There is far too much overcomplication to have to set up twice,0
Application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing - Duplicate Task feature doesn't duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated Tasks. So you cannot create a Template Task which could be used to create other similar deep Task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures. This is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently. Without this i will be forced to look at less,0
"Terrible. Paid for the full version, and it is underwhelming to say the least. Also habits seem to duplicate (some kind of bug) making it impossible to track them correctly. Waste of time and money!",0

"It was a fun app until it asked me to update to its latest version. After the update, it will no longer run. Crashes on startup.",0
Useless app unless you're looking to just do the task that they have. You cannot add task you cannot delete their task this is a worthless waste of time and data.,0
Key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of $6.50 per month with the best deal. Simply shameless.,0
"Paid for one time premium, months later they revoke my premium and ask me to pay again, the audacity of asking me to pay $45.99 twice for a task manager. Get your stuff together. P.s the email for the support staff is non existant, won't even reply.",0
"Spam notifications. When the To Do List app auto updates it changes you settings, for example causing spammy push notifications to pop up after i previously disabled notifications.",0
Too many limited functions in the trial version. If there was a one time purchase option I'd definitely get it.,0
"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is.",0

"I purchased the app I guess two years ago, it was one time purchase, this morning it got locked and is offering to buy premium. Could you please sort it out. Thank you.",0
I would say about double the ads my other free apps have. Feature put behind paywall in update (potentially more will follow). Ridiculous premium one time payment price,0
"Motivation comes from within; tools like this aren't for most people.

"Very complicated. Came prefilled with tasks, I did eventually figure out how to remove those. Still can't create a second character.",0
"It shut down after I tried to delete the preset characteristics, and I lost everything right after I had just set everything up. Really frustrating!",0
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.,0
"So I just having bit of trouble understanding I want to use idem from inventory, but instead of adding good effects I want negative effects as I have been trying get eating habits around junk food under control.

"app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL",0
Way too many intrusive ads Unusable for me No way to one time purchase a version without ads,0
It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.,0
"read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription, they said all ""major"" features are available for free. No, no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty ""major"" in my book",0

"‚ùå=DO NOT USE THIS APP if you need reminder notifications as they DO NOT WORK even with app visable on screen, let alone in the background! ‚ùå=App is pointless as DOES NOT STAY ALIVE IN MEMORY! ‚ùå=Ignore reviews from users who HAVE NOT TESTED THE APP! ‚ùå=You cannot set a notification after task start time so NO WAY TO CONFIRM TASK COMPLETION! ‚ùå=Widget DOES NOT UPDATE! ‚ùå=Dev NOT INTERESTED IN FIXING- complaints still exist since app creation! ‚ùå=Many better apps to use instead- THIS APP DOES NOT WORK!",0
Is quite expensive,0
"Novel, but boring",0
This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.,0
This is a really dumb app.,0
$50 for a simple app? No thanks.,0
I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.,0
Not very intuitive,0
"Seems like if I don't want to follow that junk on Instagram, I get - 15 points. Instant uninstall.",0
"Between tasks randomly failing without any input and undoing failed tasks creating fake duplicate tasks that cannot be deleted, this app is too buggy to use for its intended purpose.",0
"It shut down after I tried to delete the preset characteristics, and I lost everything right after I had just set everything up. Really frustrating!",0
"Spam notifications. When the To Do List app auto updates it changes you settings, for example causing spammy push notifications to pop up after i previously disabled notifications.",0
The app sends too many notifications with annoying sound üò°,0
Pay!,0
Latest update makes the widget not working,0
"Awesome app, very well developed, but p2w and too expensive where I live. Poor country. Sorry. Can't pay.",0
Couldn't figure out how to edit daily chores,0
"The app is great, I love it. However, I'm giving it one star because there is a bug that is breaking my workflow! After the last update, Everytime that I go to the task list section in order to search for a specific task, and click the magnifying glass button, the application closes automatically. I cannot search for a task after this :(",0
"We just wanted a simple checklist, not a real life character sheet",0
There are free apps available that are much better and more effective. Subscribed to the trial version and without notifying me they deducted annual subscription charges from my account. I even cancelled the subscription immediately and asked for refund but haven't received any response. Unethical and quite disappointing. The developers are money hungry who don't care about their customers.,0
I cancelled my subscription after getting the trial but apparently it re enabled it and it charged ne and now I can't get a refund. App is a scam and robbed me,0
"No abrio, gracias por nada",0
"Ugh. Has lots of potential and would be very serviceable for some but not me. And, I didn't realize this until after I had signed up for the seven day trial. For the life of me, I cannot find how to cancel it. Can somebody send me in the right direction?",0
Too complicated,0
Frustrating and limited.,0
could you please add the option to move the tasks it's unbelievable that a app this good does not have the option to move the tasks and every thing is stuck I want to organize the task my way not using a filter how much do I need to pay for you to implement this change ? if you do this I'll give you a 5 star and pay lifetime plus a big bonus.,0
Update Broke The App. It now crashes whenever I try to swipe to a different tab. My 5 star review is now sadly a 1.,0
"The constant ""turn on notifications"" popup made me uninstall this immediately after testing it out. It seems fine if you want notifications on, but there is no way to turn it off without it making the app frustrating to use. Ive found with these types of apps the notifications come at the worst times and are distracting, so i do not want them on at all. Seems counterintuitive when the app is meant to help accomplish tasks, to force a distraction during them.",0
The quality of the app is very low and slow and it has ads. There are many problems.,0
I could build a better experience with exel.,0
"It gives you a set of random tasks and you can't remove them. I tried to remove them so I could set my own and it just removed them from one day and subtracted a bunch of gold from my character. Customization is kind of important for an app like this, but I guess the creator disagrees.",0
"Locking the dark mode theme behind a paywall is not a user-friendly decision. A theme, especially something as basic as dark mode, is not a functionality. I'd use the app more with dark mode to test and determine if the premium features are worth investing in. Please consider making it accessible to all users.",0
Way too many intrusive ads Unusable for me No way to one time purchase a version without ads,0
Ads,0
"Way overcomplicated for a simple To Do List app. You need to create a task, search through the extremely limited icons, set the XP and coins you get from it, set the XP and coins you lose if you miss it, set all the skills you improve, set the percentages of how much for all of the above, set the reoccurance (which is about 3 steps in and of itself), turn on notifications, tell it WHEN to notify, and finally, save it. For every single task. That's not even getting into the premium features yet.",0
didn't really work that well,0
Frauds,0
Is retarded to think someone is getting a schedule app with no calendar included in itself,0
why the display name has to be 5 characters long? what about people with 4 or 3 letter names? xD this is ridiculous,0
"Just discovered this and was liking it. I'm on the free 7 day trial and was considering buying it after. However, just got an update which seems to be just so they can sell all our data to companies. Think twice about using this app which has very personal information about our habits. So greedy. You'll already a PAID app. It would still be wrong if you were free but at least a little understandable.",0
Unable to install in pixel 7 Android 14,0
Makes me sign in but then doesn't carry over information across devices. There is far too much overcomplication to have to set up twice,0
"For creating tasks, it's too much...",0
"Motivation comes from within; tools like this aren't for most people. Still, I'm sure there is a way to see something other than a conglomerate of mundane mediocrity bundled into an application based on Motivation.

Very bad app exactly I don't need to give atlest 1 ‚òÜ,0
Was pretty good but it made it impossible for me to cancel yearly subscription,0
Annoying premium offers pop up.,0
Need desktop app,0
Just stupid,0
It doesn't even load. It just stays on the I'm screen. White screen with the icon picture in the middle.,0
"I purchased the app I guess two years ago, it was one time purchase, this morning it got locked and is offering to buy premium. Could you please sort it out. Thank you.",0
Too many nonsensical preloaded tasks.,0
Really? I have to subscribe to use the *bed icon*???? The one it has automatically set up for one of the first tasks??????,0
very introusive,0
Does not work. Will not let me turn on notifications despite it shutting off my podcast with a notification even thoughy phone it set to silent. The toggle is frozen. No other app is affected. Clicking the toggle does nothing and the app locks me out with a pop up requesting a permission I can't grant. Phone is up to date software wise. Not sure whats wrong. Looked promising too. Guess I'll need to uninstall and wait to see if it gets fixed.,0
added ads,0
"With one of the recent updates intrusive Ads have been introduced. While I totally get that ad-free will not finance the effort of development, this kind of Ads (ad video autoplaying full screen every 4(!!) task ticks) is totally inacceptable. I was about to give a good rating and buying plus soon, but this killed it for me. Sad.",0
"Notifications don't work, even with the ""set reminder"" option it won't tell me there's something I have to do",0
won't open without google play,0
"Good in theory, but it's so irritating to get it to do what you want",0
"So I just having bit of trouble understanding I want to use idem from inventory, but instead of adding good effects I want negative effects as I have been trying get eating habits around junk food under control. So have things in my store like cookies, ice cream and want do task where it removes from my inventory when doing said task. Is there way do this or is premium thing?",0
Pretty good however it still need a lot of improvements,0
"I love this app! So much that I opted to pay for the permanent subscription. There's just one thing that I don't find great. No Google calendar integration, and no dedicated calendar widget. I could survive of either of these two features existed, but not having either makes it a pain to use. When I schedule tasks, I now have to duplicate them in my Google calendar. What a hassle! I emailed the developer, and got no response whatsoever, so I'm hoping they at least read the reviews!",0
Don't download this app. This app isn't easy to use plus the subscription or one time payment are too expensive.,0
Completely broken app. The auto fail system keeps spamming on the same task. I've lost all my levels and gold. When you undo a failed task in the task execution screen it doesn't even give back the same amount of skill xp. I paid for premium and I'm very disappointed I can't even use this app anymore.,0
Fantastic,0
Useless unless you already have a Microsoft account,0
"Edit: still don't have a way to change my ""default"" alarm tone without a third party app, and I'd still like to set different tones and reminders per task. Second edit: all the notifications and alarms seem to happen either regularly three minutes late, or, if I haven't turned on my phone screen in a while, as late as 4 pm for a 9 am reminder. The battery and notification settings are all set so this should not happen. Going to have to try something else.",0
"In this app you can make a task template that can be reused over and over. However you need to pick a set frequency for it to appear. You can't pick a single day for it to appear. So the easy fix to this is to create a single non recurring task, but you have to start from scratch and that sucks if it's big task with alot of subtasks that have to be typed in again. It would be perfect if you could make a template for nonrecurring tasks that can be give a different time/alarm every time its used.",0
"2018-11-19 -it seems useful, but it crashes on my phone 3 - 15 times a day. 2019-04-13 - No update, this app would be great if it didn't crash just about every time I go to my home screen from *anywhere*. Also there have been no update, and no responses to the roughly 75 - 100 error logs that I have submitted. I paid $5.00 (US) for a ""life time subscription"" to the premium version. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY !!!!!!",0
I just paid for premium as I was told by the app developers that it would enable me to sync my data from my old android phone onto my new android phone. But it fails everytime I click 'sync'. I sent the developers my feedback but they won't get back to me.,0
"The problem I have is that if I set a habit to be every Monday and Wednesday, for example, and I follow it successfully for a few weeks. Then if I just want to change the days, it discards all my previous progress, which is stupid. I just changed the days and the app can't understand this.",0
"This app seemed to have all the features I wanted, but the sync did not work after I paid $10 for the sync feature. I emailed their support with no reply. Very bad customer service.",0
This app would be great if they would just stop locking people out of premium. This has happened with several users for months and still not fixed. I got a new phone and can't use this app because login with Facebook won't transfer. This is my first one star review I ever gave an app and to say I am disappointed. Just use one of the many other habit trackers.,0
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to",0
"I've enjoyed the app for a few years, but it has gotten increasingly buggy for me--the widget works intermittently, and all of a sudden one of my habits stopped tracking a streak today, which persisted even after uninstalling and reinstalling.",0
I purchased the app to make full use of it and add many habits with a reminder for each. But the reminder doesnt work at all. Initially for some habits it used to remind randomly but after a day of purchasing none of the reminders are working :( please solve my issue as i really wanted to use this app to its potential.,0
"Very frustrated with this app. Was using it to track goals, paid for it so I could save data in preparation for switching. Setup new phone, try to login and FB login no longer works and email not recognized. Great app, not worth paying for at all.",0
"The app is very good. Giving one star because, data sync doesn't work even for paid version. So if you change the phone, you lose all tracking history. And as others reviews are saying there is no service by developers.",0
It's laggy and buggy as hell. 1) u need to resize widget to check 2) widget shows only top 4 habits. I am so tired of it. Totally not worth its money as nobody fixes these bugs for almost half a year! I paid 10 bucks for just a WIDGET and it doesn't work. This is totally frustrating,0
"This is the free version. The paid version is $7.99, the Platinum version is even more. You can only track 5 habits in the free version. Developers must be paid, but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable. (I should charge for this.) Do not install. #doughymiddle",0
"Checklist widget crashes and has to be deleted and reinstated every time I want to tick something off. The rest of the app is okay, if a bit crowded and overwhelming before I turned off the forum feed, motivational pics and notifications ... but having a checklist to interact with is 100% why I downloaded the app.",0
"App works but I got very disappointed after I purchased the premium features only to discover that sync between devices doesn't work, and that the app developer is completely unresponsive to my support requests, so I wasted my money and am not able to get a refund.",0
not a bad app but the worst customer service and thw widgets dont work once you pay for premium! just use the free version. your more likely to succeed if you focus on less goals at one time anyhow! DONT BUY PREMIUM!! WHEN IT TURNS OUT IT DOESNT WORK YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GET A REFUND!,0
The registration function doesn't work. Choose your email from autocomplete and the app spits you back to the Start screen. If you can't get registration to work I don't like your chances of having a decent app. Uninstalled,0
"Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails.",0
"Broken and abandoned by anyone with any level of competence. Widget? Broken. Data backup? Dead. UI? Outdated and ugly. I'm done with this garbage, and I hope the developers never experience happiness ever again.",0
"Very expensive for a simple app, and quite useless without buying the premium. Only tracks 5 habits? Lame. I can't believe this is the app advertised in the play store, and still has a high rating because it is garbage. Sounds like even if I bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims, I won't even risk it.",0
"Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times.",0
"Clean, easy to use design. But why on Earth are simple functions locked behind a $10 a month paywall? Uninstalled in favor of a completely free alternative with all the same features (including premium features, except cloud save).",0
I paid back in the day for premium when the app was called 'Habit bull' yet when I try to log in it says my email is not in the database... Well the purchase history says otherwise and this seems to me as a scam tactic to pay double... I will not let this drop so easily I will contact Google and the payment company if I don't get what I paid for.,0
"Started off OK but now no notifications work at all which is kind of key. I don't like that you can't pause a habit (you can deactivate but that doesn't feel right) and if you want it to work properly, you need to pay the random amount charged that day/week/month but I wouldn't advise it as the devs never respond on any platform and their forum shows loads of dissatisfied buyers. There's actually a decent app in here somewhere but no notifications and no support = 1*.",0
Really glad I paid for the pro version! This app totally stopped working once I upgraded. No notifications at all for any of my tasks. I wouldve been better off using Google Calendar.,0
Beware - no replies for supoort. I bought this app and switched phones. The app does not recognize my PREMIUM account. I have emailed them 3x with no response. Sent a copy of my receipt and spent time trying to get help... Now I Will spend time giving reviews every time I think of this until it's resolved. Addendum: it's been 4 days since I wrote this... And no reply or offer to help. Speaks volumes.,0
Paid for a full subscription then got a new phone and it won't let me login to my paid account. Have emailed suport multiple times but they never respond! Absolutely useless service! Paying for this app is an absolute waste of money!,0
"has lost features over the years. back when i first used this years ago when it was called habit bull, i could set goals like, ""do this thing x times a week."" that doesn't appear to be an option anymore, so this app has become effectively useless.",0
"An app absolutely focused on my needs... that has broken. The sync function broke down about 3 or 4 months ago, it can export its data to .csv but not import it.",0
"I paid for premium, then followed (twice) every single instruction in the FAQ section regarding how to sync data between devices. Syncing did not work. I wasted 2 hours of my day trying to get this app to work.",0
"Got hold of the Premium version with high expectations but was disappointed on getting to know that the habits created on a device is not appearing on another device with the same account. Going back to ""Loop"".",0
"Confused in that I downloaded ""Habbit Tracker"" but the app that downloaded was ""Habbit Bull""? Also I couldnt find any contact info on the app for help / questions so I guess ill try here. My goal is to run a certain ammount of miles per week, but I can only find an option to set a daily goal so my days show up as failures. Is there not a way to set a weekly number goal without a daily goal?",0
Sadly no longer works I loved the tracking and having a great message sent that you could give the thumbs üëç or thumb down to. However the motivational content hasn't worked regardless of the amount of times I've tried to fix!,0
"I rarely rate, but this app is ridiculous. It's half broken, with terrible old design, very little functionality and the developer is charging ¬£4.50 a month! While there is so much better app in every possible way and completely free without adds. Just uninstall this rubbish and try Loop Habit Tracker ;)",0
Very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber. Strongly recommend against this app. Not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails.,0
"Last update ruined notifications! (Pixel 4a, Android 10) I no longer receive daily reminders (which I loved) and I no longer get an inspirational photo, only a blank white space.üòü I love this app and it's truly helped me. Please fix these issues so I can change my review back to 5 stars!!!",0
I lost a couple of years worth data of my habits! I had purchased the premium for sync option. Syn hasn't been working. Extremely disappointed! No reply to emails from you guys! How is this app Editor's choice!?,0
"Bought the premium version; couldn't access my 100 habits. Emailed team; took many emails for them to address problem; asked to redownload app; all data deleted; problem was never solved; more emails to get money back; told that they are a ""small team""; worst experience with any app I've ever bought.",0
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.,0
"Purchsses HabitBull now Habit Tracker.. years ago...found the receipt and emailed them several times....no answer. I tried writing a review, no answer... I tried Google searches for head office...no word from them , so now I make a tradition to warn everyone against paying for this....besides there's a FREE app thats just as good called Loop habit tracker. Try that first.",0
"Good app, appallingly bad support. Paid for premium and enjoyed the app for 2 years. Old phone died now can't restore the data on the new phone. The ligin is not recognized. Noone replying to the emails. So much for ""premium""... Quick googling reveals many people experience the same... Frustrating",0
"Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says ""this email account is not in our database"" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost.",0
"It used to be called Habit Bull and I did buy premium. I swapped to new phone recently but it is impossible to login with my Gmail. Literally no login option, kept asking me to Register with Mail or Connect with Facebook. Trying to register with my old mail it'll only say address already taken. Thanks dingus I'm trying to login not create new account! The lack of updates since 2020 also means this is a dead app.",0
"It has begun crashing all the time lately :( Lacks a lot of options - for instance I would like to be able to do something at most once in two days, but there's no such option.",0
"App is good. But i got the premieum just for the widgets. Unfortunately they don't work ! Most of the time they are unclickable, whatever item i press on the widget, no action occurs, I can-t record my habit doing. I need help with this.",0
"Cash grab, and nothing more. Purchased the app a year ago but now due to an issue on the account being asked to pay for it again. Very disappointed and no response from seller. Last update was 1 year ago so as far as I am concerned the developer abondoned it.",0
"Disliked the app so much that I got rid of it after 1.5 hours. Not really free, not like it claimed to be. Here's a real warning though: once you sign up, it's hard to get out. There was nothing on the app to let me delete my account, I can't get to it on the web, so I wrote to them THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO and just got a response today. After several nonsensical messages, I still can't get the account closed. This company just scoops up other apps and collects them for profit. I'd stay away from all of their apps.",0
"I bought a new phone. Reinstalled this app. Years of habits log, gone! I thought this thing syncs in the background? As some folks have commented, syncing no longer works. No updates. No support responses.",0
"The reminders don't work. No noise. No vibration. I even bought premium to see if that would help. No luck. If I wanted a place to just mark my progress, I'd keep an Excel spreadsheet.",0
"Rubbish - the app no longer works properly. I've used this to track habits for years and even paid for the premium version. Yesterday it suddenly stopped working. I've emailed customer service with ZERO response. They take your money, then ignore all your emails.",0
"When it works it's great but after using it for a while and paying for the ability to export and sync data, all my data is gone. Every attempt to contact them goes unanswered and the last update was over a year ago. They're willing to take your money but not to update or support the software. Use this at your own risk.",0
"Main reason I was drawn to pay the subscription for this app was the widget being easily accessible on the first screen of my phone, otherwise I'd be less likely to stay on track having to locate and open the app multiple times a day to tick things off... for a while now, the widget is constantly freezing and won't allow me to tick things off. Sometimes I'll have to delete and re-add it to my home screen and occasionally it works. ent an email to the developers about this a while ago, no respone",0
Unfortunately deleting due to bugs. It doesn't matter how many times I reset the app and turn on notifications - notifications don't work. It constantly crashes while running in the background and doesn't fulfil its purpose. I had previously given 4 stars but the app keeps asking for a new review.,0
"*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.",0
"I really liked the app. I've even purchased the ad free version to support the developer. However, be advised - if you use the app and need to change your phone or reset it, your data will be lost and you will not have any support. I switched to a new phone after 3+ years of using my old one and now all the data is not transferrable. Unfortunately, I will have to manually add everything. And I will simply add it to another app that I've tried and works when you need to backup and restore.",0
"I spent SO much time adding all of my desired habits into this app, set their days, goal duration etc, all in vain. The stupid app didn't send me a single reminder to complete the tasks even after I set different reminders for each habit. And ya, my phone app notifications are on, so it's an app issue only. Moreover, you cannot tick off an entry for the previous day. If you forgot to tick a habit, your streak is broken for no reason & you can't check it later. Waste of time.",0
"Notifications no longer work. On Android 14, Samsung One UI 6.1, the permission for notifications is grayed out, cannot enable notifications for this app.",0
"Notification Bar is to small. The notification that I receive after setting up everything (including but not limited to alarm sounds) is very small - just a 0.01x0.01 png image of a bull and the app defaut alarm sound - but there is not any visual effects [I have the volume turned up, and I went into the system settings to make sure that the app sound overrides the system to pop up on the screen] and I was wanting the display to illuminate over the whole screen and/or open the app up.",0
"I used to love this app. Now you can't even add your own habit without jumping through tons of drop down menus. I literally just wanted to add ""walking"" as a habit. Nope... ""What category is your habit in? Now which sub category?"" Meanwhile still have not started walking because I'm too busy awith your interface! Not good. Uninstalling and headed walking.",0
"DO NOT PURCHASE! The app works as it's supposed to, with exception for the added purchase features. I bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices, that feature does not work despite following the FAQ as to why it might not work. I have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response, but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund.",0
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking.""",0
"There is no way to get I'm touch with anyone. I purchased premier but when contacting them to sync my 2 devices, like they tell you to, all messages go unanswered. Even worse, because you don't have to register your email when you purchase, I am not able to even sign in anymore since I tried to sign in on my second device. I am signed out so I cannot use it at all and nobody will respond. If you look on social media, there are countless stories like this. This is a scam.",0
"Unrecoverably crashed, reinstalled. Then the data partially gone. Pretty disappointed. No response from the devs. In hindsight this is an app that haven't released for more than a year, so could have been expected. Data is not critical of course (bunch of date markers), but it feels like all those habits disappeared with the data :/",0
"I've used this app on iPhone before. I had at least 2 years worth of habits tracked. I recently switched to android and tried logging in but it keeps telling me something went wrong and to try again in a bit. I've uninstalled the app several times but it won't change anything. I tried registering a new account and it keeps kicking me back to the first login screen. I can't select the ""forgot password"" option either. I really hope this can be resolved soon.",0
"I've owned and used this app for years. I really liked it. I had to uninstall because of storage space priorities. Now that I've got more available space in my phone, I've reinstalled. Unfortunately, it keeps crashing. I open it, and it instantly closes. Then I have to open it again. And if I leave it to go to Home and another app, then go to pull it up again, it crashes. I've done all the basic trouble shooting. Didn't help. Incredibly disappointed.",0
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.",0
"Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.",0
"ETA: 10/28/23 Still not fixed. I've since uninstalled this app. Lost all my progress, but found MUCH better RELIABLE apps in its place. Highly recommend skipping this app unless you want zero alerts and crashing constantly. 9/23 This app was great until recently. The alarms/reminders no longer work and my android keeps alerting me that the app is ""frequently crashing"". Will be removing and trying a new app if not resolved soon. Just a shame to lose all my documented progress.",0
"I'd been a paid Premium user for a long time & loved the app, found it helpful, but the 8/30/23 update really messed it up. Notifications stopped working, Android 13 wantrd me to it in Deep Sleep because it's was causing frequent system crashes, & 2 wks of my data disappeared. Other reviews say similar. I cancelled my Premium Subscription after a month w/no fix but periodically check for updates. I would resubscribe in a heartbeat if it worked because it's great software that I really relied on.",0
"Does what it's supposed to do. Alarms work, 3xweekly calculation works, counters per day works. Unobtrusive, reasonably simple. Silly greetings are amusing. The above was my original review. Last fall, though, the remiers quit working. Not sure if Google automatically removed some app permission, couldn't figure out how to fix it so I uninstalled and will try to reinstall. Knocked off 2 stars. Uninstall/reinstall didn't fix anything, so I need to find a new app.",0
"update: previous (non ""2"") version had a simple zoom gesture, which this later version lack. instead, the zoom gesture only strech the day and leave the event name the same. I get it that you want users to pay for the option to set font size but bigger font size doesn't always fit events with longer names. so for now i'll stick to the original. in response to your reply: a review is about product usability, not just technical problems.",0
Loved this app until ALL my entered appointments past and present disappeared. I don't know what happened but don't think I did anything unusual. Fortunately I run a paper diary!,0
"I just bought premium and realized I made a mistake right away! It told me to register to sync my data and I did. Sync option wouldn't do anything. I wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time. Then half the screen was empty and I decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now ALL MY DATA IS GONE! So stupid! I just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and I lost everything! Don't recommend this app, so disappointed...",0
"This is a joke, right? I was happily using the free version when I tried to make my sixth habit. You can only make five habits on the free version. Fine, you know what, I'm willing to pay $10 for this, it's handy. Nope, it's $7/month. They want me to pay $252 over the next three years for an app that could be replaced by 10 sheets of paper? How utterly ludicrous. This app has no business being a subscription. Get Goal Tracker instead, it's 100% free and does the exact same thing.",0
Reminders no longer work. App keeps crashing.,0
"I paid for premium when transitioning to a new phone, and my history was transferred. I recently had to un+re-install the App for personal reasons and it does not recognise my account anymore. Creator contact has not responded to numerous courteous emails. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Wish I could get 3+ years of data back. I loved the App, and the App itself is 5 stars but will only rate 1 due to reasons above. Would change to 5 stars if resolved.",0
"I have been using the app from the last 3 years. I am a premium user. When trying to sign in a new device and sync, it's not syncing. I need my data. please help with this issue. Even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding. So i am changing the rating from 3 to 1.",0
The app is not valued your past data records rather they are eager to earn money. I've been using since one and half year. After my phone's reseting due to a custom software update I'd installed this app again and tried to log in to sync my data but it displayed that I've no account against my email Id. After several time I used to log in with my user name and then they displayed to purchase premium subscription to access previous saved data.This is my first time bitter experience with them.,0
"As a person with ADHD, it can be difficult to maintain habits. This app used to be great, but recently, it no longer works correctly. Reminder notifications do not appear, and I forget to do things I need to as a result. Those reminders were the main reason I paid for this app and used it for as long as I have. Unfortunately I have to now say to skip this app.",0
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive,0
I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.,0
"Soooo disappointing. Had to find a substitute for my Habit Minder app when I moved to Android. Habit Tracker seemed. The interface is great, love the tracking graphs, but its reminders don't work consistently at all - which defeats the whole purpose!!! Really miss my Habit Minder and hope they make an android version soon.",0
"App no longer supported, data loss likely: Was a great app until I needed to migrate to a new phone. The sync feature never worked, and I lost months of habit data. I tried contacting the developer via the supplied email, but zero response. I used to recommend this app to many people, but I'm done with it.",0
"Developer is non-responsive. For some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect Google account. I have verified I am downloading the app with my intended account, however it continually associates with the wrong account. It's not really a big deal, but I was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits. The account this app associates to does not have any.",0
Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.,0
"This app doesn't let me log in to my previous account. Once I skipped the initial registration page due to some network issues, I tried logging in but it only shows Sign Up or connect to Facebook which I definitely don't want to use. When I use my previous account on Sign up it tells me that the email is already taken. Please fix this issue.",0
"Home screen doesn't work at all on pixel 7! Very disappointed this app doesn't work for me anymore. It was fine on Samsung but since switching to pixel, it no longer works not showing the circles on the weekly multihabit page which means it no longer works for how I had been using this for years! I used to recommend this app to everyone but now I will be recommending not to use it.",0
"Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.",0
Really liked the app and have been using premium but now I want to transfer to a new device. I can only doing this by signing up but whenever I go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again. Really frustrating. If you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars.,0
"This app claimed it was syncing to the cloud. When I lost everything on my phone and had to reinstall it, signed in, and tried to sync ... there was nothing. I have an open support case that nobody at Habitbull has responded to (#900271) Do not trust this app or whether it will backup your habit tracking data. Terrible customer service and fail of an app.",0
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""",0
"It's a great app, used it for over a year happily. Even paid for it. Recently had to switch phones and when I reinstalled on my new phone the sync function doesn't work. Without sync i've lost all my data. Tried emailing the developers for support but they don't reply.",0
"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium? There is a sync option in the app. Don't tell me I should have manually ""synced"" my stuff",0
"Update 2020: sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version. Lost my account and no means of logging back in. Otherwise, the app is good especially the UI. Like this app but until recently I had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing. If you could help me locate my account as I bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account. Please help because I want to use this great app!",0
"Very bad! Account registration kept failed despite multiple attempts. When I finally succeed after 1 hour, i couldn't log in! Kept showing Internet problem while i could surf smoothly on other device. Obviously there's bugssss but the developer just don't bother, push all to user issues! Don't purchased! Doesn't worth your time and money. Frustrating! üò°üò†",0
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars.",0
"I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck. Emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply. If I want to take a backup I have to screenshot everything. not ideal Apart from this the app is decent. It's got a cute meme",0
The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.,0
I'm not sure what the update has done but the app will no longer let me share my events by text or whatsapp it has done for years before ! Can you fix?,0
This app used to work great. I bought the premium version. Then they cannibalized it and it no longer works. They seem to have changed the name of the app from HabitBull to Habit Tracker. So they also are killing their brand. Ridiculous. üñïüèª,0
I paid $10 for the full feature set but this app crashes 10-20x per day. I just use it for the widgets and it still crashes over and over and over. Super annoying.,0
This app dosen't start. They just want to take your email id for some reason.,0
Transferring to a new Google account meant that I lost all my previous data (2yrs). Contacting support is pointless as they don't respond to emails.,0
Awesome,0
"There is no way to get I'm touch with anyone. I purchased premier but when contacting them to sync my 2 devices, like they tell you to, all messages go unanswered. Even worse, because you don't have to register your email when you purchase, I am not able to even sign in anymore since I tried to sign in on my second device. I am signed out so I cannot use it at all and nobody will respond. If you look on social media, there are countless stories like this. This is a scam.",0
Doesn't remind me to achieve my daily tasks,0
worst app i have ever seen because I can't even register in this app interface.,0
So many bugs and force closes. Widgets don't work anymore.,0
the free version only 5 habits can be added,0
Don't know what's going on with this app. It won't let me create a log in account. Crashes every time I try to sign up without losing data. It's a shame because there are some nice features. Now I have to find another habit tracker.,0
Frequently nags you to rate the app on Google play,0
Been loving the experience but I can't log in via Facebook using a new phone. It says I should download and log into Facebook app and I am already logged in. I can't access my account now. :(,0
"Home screen doesn't work at all on pixel 7! Very disappointed this app doesn't work for me anymore.

This app does everything I want but unfortunately the widget often goes to sleep and won't become responsive until I enter the app. I purchased the premium app but no response from support on the issue. Sadly it breaks a key feature I'm looking for and I'll be looking for it's replacement.,0
Google fit stopped working. Its been months. I habe deactivated app/ reinstalled. Nothing. Unlicked/ relinked. Uselss and im premium !,0
Any app that bugs me to rate gets 1 star,0
"The UI in this app is terrible, and you can't just type in any habit you want. The app is very basic and doesn't offer that many features",0
Even registration process has bugs.,0
"App was not able to register, I think it's a bug check it out. I am QA engineer.",0
I paid for the full version go this app so I could have access tor the widgets AND THEY DON'T WORK,0
"Checklist widget crashes and has to be deleted and reinstated every time I want to tick something off. The rest of the app is okay, if a bit crowded and overwhelming before I turned off the forum feed, motivational pics and notifications ... but having a checklist to interact with is 100% why I downloaded the app.",0
Only 5 habits,0
Alarm not working. Been using it for 2 yrs but alarm never worked properly.,0
I wish I could give it zero star.. you can only track 5 habits.. that you can easily do on a piece of paper... uninstalling,0
Not b able to log into the account...,0
Notifications don't work what's the point of habit tracker if you are not reminded,0
I am trying to register it's showing email ID is invalid I am using that email for everything but here it's not taking.,0
"Useless! I can keep track of habits by setting alarms, or writing notes - an app which uses data isn't worth it, esp when it wants your money.",0
It just crashes before it even begins. Was looking forward to using the app,0
The registration function doesn't work. Choose your email from autocomplete and the app spits you back to the Start screen. If you can't get registration to work I don't like your chances of having a decent app. Uninstalled,0
It's showing premium to pay money for creating habits i didn't recommend it,0
gmail login problem,0
"Widgets for premium users don't work, and their support never responds to reported issues. Even after 4 months I still have yet to receive any response to my support ticket.",0
It doesnt run on redmi 9,0
Worse üò§üò§,0
"I like the app, however customer service is far from ideal I wrote an email complaining that my habits don't sync over cloud. SINCE JANUARY I received no response.",0
Paid for a full subscription then got a new phone and it won't let me login to my paid account. Have emailed suport multiple times but they never respond! Absolutely useless service! Paying for this app is an absolute waste of money!,0
Widget doesn't work anymore!!! Please fix it!,0
The app doesn't even start,0
"Switched phone and now the app won't recognize my account or user, even though I have a premium account. Lost 5 years of data and they won't answer any of my emails. ****Problem was fixed.",0
I can't upgrade to premium. It is saying that I can't purchase this in my country (Romania) .,0
"Don't bother with this app. As others have said, widgets no longer work unless you open the app first. The whole point of a widget is that you shouldn't have to do that. Despite using this app every day for most of this year, I'm now uninstalling as it doesn't seem to be supported any more.",0
Cannot recommend - I've used for SIX YEARS and I can no longer recommend anyone use this app anymore. They now just want to sell subscriptions. No free data export. Glitchy reminder notifications.,0
Allows you to record habits but doesn't let you keep your records synced to an account without buying premium. DOESN'T MENTION THIS ANYWHERE IN APP WHEN YOU PRESS SYNC.,0
The widget stopped working do it I'd not so useful anymore,0
"I spent SO much time adding all of my desired habits into this app, set their days, goal duration etc, all in vain. The stupid app didn't send me a single reminder to complete the tasks even after I set different reminders for each habit. And ya, my phone app notifications are on, so it's an app issue only. Moreover, you cannot tick off an entry for the previous day. If you forgot to tick a habit, your streak is broken for no reason & you can't check it later. Waste of time.",0
Trash,0
Lol it crashes,0
Did not like the UI,0
"I was very surprised to find a glowing review for this app, under my name, which I did not write! Shame!",0
Habit bull. Not a lot of features.,0
"Broken and abandoned by anyone with any level of competence. Widget? Broken. Data backup? Dead. UI? Outdated and ugly. I'm done with this garbage, and I hope the developers never experience happiness ever again.",0
"Recently, there's a bug that my streaks become zero when i choose ""some of days per week"" option but in another options it doesn't have any problem",0
Unfortunately deleting due to bugs. It doesn't matter how many times I reset the app and turn on notifications - notifications don't work. It constantly crashes while running in the background and doesn't fulfil its purpose. I had previously given 4 stars but the app keeps asking for a new review.,0
The checklist widget is unresponsive. I'd give it 5 stars if it worked.,0

Widgets and notifications no longer work.,0
sadness and pain start with being succesful,0
App keeps crashing,0
Reminders no longer work. App keeps crashing.,0
"Broken! So far, not impressed. I bought this expecting multi-device sync and haven't seen it do that. It wouldn't even restore a backed up file after logging off then on.",0
"I had and paid for the premium version back then when it was called ""Habit Bull"" I loved it but since now they changed to ""Habit Tracker"" I no longer have the premium add ons and they expect for me to pay again. No thanks.",0
"Crashes, does not allow for changing notification sound...does not provide notifications.",0
This app is buggy from the start. Right from the log-in page. Not going to waste anymore time with it.,0
"ETA: 10/28/23 Still not fixed. I've since uninstalled this app. Lost all my progress, but found MUCH better RELIABLE apps in its place. Highly recommend skipping this app unless you want zero alerts and crashing constantly. 9/23 This app was great until recently. The alarms/reminders no longer work and my android keeps alerting me that the app is ""frequently crashing"". Will be removing and trying a new app if not resolved soon. Just a shame to lose all my documented progress.",0
Notifications not working,0
Unable to download CSV. Support don't reply email to premium user.,0
"Like others, I've had to change my rating to a 1- star because the app is no longer supported, at least on Android. Daily tracking used to be easy, but is now clunky or impossible.",0

Only allows 5 habits in free mode,0
No update from 2020,0

"It used to be called Habit Bull and I did buy premium. I swapped to new phone recently but it is impossible to login with my Gmail. Literally no login option, kept asking me to Register with Mail or Connect with Facebook. Trying to register with my old mail it'll only say address already taken. Thanks dingus I'm trying to login not create new account! The lack of updates since 2020 also means this is a dead app.",0
"I used to love this app. Now you can't even add your own habit without jumping through tons of drop down menus. I literally just wanted to add ""walking"" as a habit. Nope... ""What category is your habit in? Now which sub category?"" Meanwhile still have not started walking because I'm too busy awith your interface! Not good. Uninstalling and headed walking.",0
Got a new phone. Doesnt link w FB login anymore. All my data is gone.,0

"The most recent update broke the reminders feature. I've tried to update battery options, permissions, nothing gets the to work again.",0

Can you fix the widget from freezing? It doesn't allow for ticking items off and have to resize or delete and re-add widget for it to work.,0
Constant problems with syncing to Google calendar,0
The 1st action the app wants is to name a list. What am I listing and why would I name it? What I'm looking for is a reminder with an alarm using the ringtones already on my phone to remind me of important events. This app doesnt seem to function that way. I dont know what I'd use this app for.,0
"the constant requests to enable notifications are infuriating - no means no, u dont need to ask me again every time i open the app",0
Remind me not working properly it's alarm doesn't work manytimes,0
Try to make it user friendly,0
Due to persistent notifications or something else ( because other apps have many notifications too) it was causing my phone to lag and somehow have little crashes ( problem was solved after removing the app ) kept pc version,0
"Why does the widget not display every todo, this is so frustrating. What is the use my day if it's extra clicks seriously...",0
"The app is amazing, the battery use isn't. It is consistently the highest power draw app on my phone, and I rarely open it. This is a known programming issue for many years, I dont expect a fix. If I barely use my phone in the day (answer a few texts), it will be 20%+ of my battery use, and no other app is over 0.5%.

No Network Connection Please check your network settings and try again. [2604] Can you fix it ASAP?,0
"S22 - ""Pin Reminders"" setting doesn't work anymore since a few months ago. Which means reminders in the notification panel get accidentally removed/swiped away by scrolling through the notification panel. Very frustrating as you accidentally lose track of tasks! This renders the app unusable for me.",0
I'm not aure what's the reasoning behind it but the fact that I have to login into Microsoft acxount (even using my google account) does not make much sense to me. Why do I have to be logged in? I understand that with that I can share my tasks with other devices but maybe that should be my choice?,0

"Be very careful. This syncs with your tasks in Outlook.

"Horrible! So many steps!...Set a due date, set a reminder, set it to display in My Day. The reminder set screen is 2 different screens for date/time.

Takes up way too much time to organize your day! Importing did not work after several attempts. The setting reset themselves to default after I set them.",0

"Wunderlist user, looking for replacement after two days of frustration. Sync doesn't work, I have now two phones and two PCs with four different ToDo lists although all of them show the same account. My shared lists with other people don't update after the first 6-7 hours, while task update was still working there was no notification sound/message on updates (on phones), online version is either - giving me ""Something went wrong"" message or shows empty lists. The new installations (on 3rd and 4th device) are also giving me ""Something went wrong"" when trying to import Wunderlist ... I am skrewed. Need to find replacement before Wunderlist is gone, have hundreds of tasks on 19 projects, can't afford something so unreliable as MS ToDo turned out to be. The experience of my teammate is very similar (same issues, but she has only two devices). Not enough data points to judge this app, but I have no more time to waste.",0
"Please help fix this issue because I need this app for work and it used to work perfect. on mobile device when trying to edit the notes field of a task, there is a glitch that makes it impossible to use.  It is automatically moving the cursor to the bottom of the note and there is an automatic carriage return that will not stop.  It just keeps scrolling down and expanding the note with blank lines and not allowing editing of the lines above.",0
"Final edit: for anyone coming from Wunderlist, just switch to ""Todoist"". It's got a different workflow / terminology, but it fills the gap. Edit: This app doesn't even work. My girlfriend and I edit a shared list and we don't see any of each other's updates. This is junk. Original Review: Being forced into this app from Wunderlist (major cheese movage, not cool!). And they hid data migration in a menu instead of just offering to do it up front. Wow.",0
"UPDATE 1/31/2021 - it gets ""worse' Not the end of the world... but my wife just bought all the groceries I bought the previous day. You'd guess it was a synching issue, but it wasn't, I could see what she had added, but she didn't see that I had checked off a bunch of things. Great. Good thing we have a large freezer. Might need to find a new app... Original review: Like many others before me, I'm reviewing this app because of the annoying ""Plan your day reminders"" that you can't turn off. Well, you can turn it off, but then it somehow gets switched back on. Every day.",0
"Wunderlist was a wonderful piece of software that initially continued to work well after being acquired by Microsoft. The conversion to ToDo was ok (some lost features, but initially seemed ok). The Android and desktop app no longer consistently sync. And lately, the app consistently loses my repeating tasks (they simply disappear upon completion), completed recurring tasks still display on My Day, and recurring tasks also lately weirdly create duplicate tasks when repeating. ToDo isn't even close to Wunderlist, unfortunately, so time to move on.",0
"It keeps getting worse. This was a great tool when it was wunderlist. Ever since MS bought them, it has gone down hill. I use it from the browser and my phone, and have many shared lists. It takes and average of THREE TIMES to get items to actually be marked completed. They just KEEP COMING BACK. It's only getting worse too. That, and the CONSTANT LOGOUTS silently disconnecting my browser, causing me to lose work, and then refresh, and then re-log in, with no way to FIX IT. I mean, what a facepalm. I hate this app now. I have 20 different lists, 200 or so items in it, and I'm now angry enough to dump the product. I guess it must be I just use it too much, access it from too many different apps/browsers. I don't know, but I no longer recommend this tool.",0
"This app is terrible compared to wunderlist especially if you like the functionality to share a list with another. We cannot seem to get the shareable feature to work. Additionally, even though I'm logged in with the same account on my laptop and phone., it doesn't sync lists. New items are added to the bottom of a list instead of the top. Microsoft has a lot of work to do to get this where it needs to be.",0
The desktop app works well enough but I haven't hated an android app this much in a long time. I keep it installed only for reminders I set on my desktop to be displayed on my phone. I'm tired of trying to add things via the phone over and over again. This is one of the very few Microsoft apps I use because Microsofts goal in life seems to be making the simplest tasks very difficult. On that subject I may be a Linux user before much longer.,0
"WARNING!!! 1.)Microsoft TODO Syncs typos or errors you make in your notes. UNACCEPTABLE! Does NOT allow you to discard unwanted changes to your notes like WUNDERLIST does. Accidentally delete or change something important in your notes? Cut and paste go wrong? YOURE OUT OF LUCK! 2.)You have to wait up to 4 days sometimes for a backup. Wunderlist did exports in seconds. 3.)New tasks are put at the bottom. the longer your list gets, the more you have to scroll to the bottom. Unlike Wundelist",0
Lacking basic features It doesn't appear to have location based alerts which puts it behind both Apple and Google for usability on their most basic productivity apps. If you dont want me to use the built in app you are going to have to be 10% better than all the rest and you aren't even equal to the rest and now you are shutting down Wunderlist without having implemented this most requested feature since 2011. Pass.,0
"Any Microsoft product should have zero stars available. I cannot say strongly enough, if you love crashes, frustration and impossibly awful software. . . then get this app. Imports from Wunderlist do not stay put, they disappeared. Shared lists are now two different lists with the same name. One version shows only completed tasks, my fone shows incomplete. Thanks Bill for your 100% record of ruining everything you buy. Oh and 4.5 stars out of five?? I call BS. Look at the reviews.",0
"They took away Wunderlist for this? Wunderlist was literally the most perfect To Do list program ever. I told so many people about it. They recently replaced it with ToDo, and it is nowhere near as good. Old features don't work any longer and even the view/layout is much less pleasing. Just give us back Wunderlist and call it ToDo, I don't care, but I want my Wunderlist back!",0
"Really frustrating experience. The list sharing is incredibly frustrating. My wife and I were on several lists together on wunderlist and when we transfered to this new app, we had to text message the lists we shared. She shared some of the same lists with me and now we have duplicate lists. It's completely FUBAR. We are abandoning the platform now to find something better.",0
"When I first switched over that only the sub lists could be shared, and only one by one, as opposed being able to share a group of list. Other users have also flagged this issue, unfortunately no update on this feature as of yet. I continue to use the app and adding multiple items to multiple list. I signed in today and found that all of a sudden only 4 headings left. All the lists (hundreds of items), gone. Had to email developer because I couldn't find how to contact support via the app.",0
It's trash. Was forced to switch from Wunderlist only to have this app repeatedly fail as it reported there was a problem with my Microsoft account. I had a nicely working solution that I didn't have to think about. Now that's now gone thanks to this company's need to get it's branding on my phone. At this point I'm going to cut my losses and find some non-proprietary way of keeping/sharing to-do data. No more startups that get bought up and disappear.,0
"Had to uninstall because I kept getting annoying reminders each day that it's time to plan my day. I turned these off in notification settings, only for it to turn itself back on EVERY DAY. Tried turning it off multiple days, but it keeps turning itself back on.

"As an experienced Office 365 subscriber, Android has enough standalone To Do/List apps. What it lacks is a cohesive all-in-one Personal Information Manager. For Windows, that has, for years been Microsoft Outlook. Instead of developing a standalone To Do app, Microsoft development time would be better served adding Tasks and Contacts to it's Outlook app. Extending functionality to the Microsoft Outlook Android app to mirror Microsoft Outlook for Windows would make so much more sense.",0
"I've tried using the app with a shared list for grocery shopping with my partner. When one of us adds a new item to the list, it rarely populates on the other person's list. We've had this issue both using Apple devices and Android devices. We have restarted devices, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and checked to make sure our devices are updated, but nothing seems to make a difference.",0
"This app WAS AMAZING & it once replaced all others that I used for productivity until the ""notes"" section began a horrible glitch. While typing, it scrolls so you cannot effectively continue to to read, or edit anything that is written. As an event planner, I literally use digital notes to keep track of EVERYTHING. This is extremely disappointing, but looks like I was correct in considering transferring all of my data to another app over the past few months!",0
This app is CONSTANTLY dropping added data. I use it to remember all of my 'to-dos' and it drops 1/2 of them. Stuff I have deleted reappears. The app is NEVER in synch with the co-user of my lists. Terrible. I miss Wunderlist. I am in the process of finding a different app to manually transfer all of my data to. That process will be much less frustrating than trying to use this one.,0
"This was my favorite app for many months, center of my home screen, used it every single day multiple times a day. Loved it. Put so many tasks, reminders, notes, subtasks, etc. in it. And then, a few days ago, I opened it up and everything was gone. Everything. Thought, OK maybe it will get restored in a couple days, but nope. Thinking about starting to enter things again, but the prospect of finding it all deleted again someday has taken the fun right out of that. Sooooo disappointed.",0
"I want to like this app, but I regularly run into a problem where it does not notify me of a task even when I set a specific date/time for it to provide a reminder. This happens at random and for no apparent reason. A task app that cannot reliably remind you of the tasks is pretty much useless. Microsoft needs to fix this. Update 2/10/21: Still not giving reminders at random. Unbelievable.",0
Feel like can add calender,0
"It's just okay, it's too easy to delete tasks on accident and it puts it in backwards",0
"The star rating & my comment are only for the move capability. The order within the list can't be easily rearranged. Move to top and move to bottom is the only option. There's another move which tries to move the task to the same list if you have only one list. What is needed is a simple drag and drop of a task to a different order. The 2nd option is to have only 'Move' upon touch and hold, and then pop up a sub menu. This sub menu can have up / down arrow and other move choices.",0
I like the Apple task app way better.,0
"Good idea for an app, but I uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface. For example, there are 2 ""+"" symbols, neither of which are self-explanatory (is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category. I'd prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and, additionally, a description of what list you're working under after you enter a list.

"There's no recent edits or undo functionality to the tasks. There's also no save button. So you can lose all your changes if you made a change elsewhere, and somehow it didn't get updated to their servers, then view the task on another computer, and nothing has changed.

"I've been using Wunderlist, finally downloaded this to switch. I went to use my info from there, it says it's linked to a Microsoft account, so I go to sign in using that. I sign in just fine but it takes me to my Microsoft account page, no way to actually use the app. Closing it just means I have to sign in again, and back to the account page. I absolutely can't find a way to get to the app/it's features from this page. Beyond frustrating.",0
"A Horrible upgrade! Its predecessor, Wunderlist, was a very useful tool. I could easily add new tasks and speak them by pressing one button. Now you have to go through a variety of clicks to do the same. Wunderlist easily and seamlessly integrated into my different operating platforms. Unfortunately, to do list requires that you use Windows 10 which I do not have and refuse to upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro. There are other lists out there that you may want to consider.",0
"Edit: originally 3/5 because it is a nice app with one major flaw. Microsoft commented on my original review saying to contact customer service via email I did and they told me to look at one setting but my phone doesn't have that setting. They responded back basically ""o well. That's all we got"" and said it's my phone's fault. Like really? Piss poor support. Especially considering the app works fine for an extended period but then will stop. Can't be the setting they recommended.",0
"Terrible. When you sign in using the app on a laptop it resets all other apps...like your user info on office 365, which screws up every thing you do outside of the app. I don't want it all connected to one email. I like my apps separate. There is also no week view, and so far I've gotten no reminders despite them being set. Very disappointed that wonderful Wunderlist is being replaced by this unuseable nightmare of an app. I'm not going to be using this.",0
"OMG!! They BROKE what was a very good app! Completed ""tasks"" can no longer be sorted which makes this app USELESS. We mostly use this app for shopping lists with hundreds of items on the list, mostly in the completed section. When we again need the item, we just uncheck it. When these items were listed alphabetically they were easy to find. Now they are in random order and impossible to find. WOW",0
"Someone thought it was a good idea to add a ""feature"" that asks me ""what i plan to do today?"" EVERY. DAY. You can turn it off if you can find the option buried somewhere. I dont need a reminder app to suddenly start reminding me to set up reminders. Seriously who though this was a good idea to add? UPDATE: You can turn off the daily reminder BUT IT WILL TURN ITSELF BACK ON. Also, WHY do I need a Microsoft account? What if I dont want to sync reminders to anything outside my phone? So bad!",0
"I used to love this app, but for the past month or two, the ""Add Note"" feature has an annoying glitch, which makes it impossible to use. There is some type of automatic carriage return going on that just keeps scrolling down, no matter what you do. If you finger swipe to go to the top, you can barely click the screen where you want to edit before it glitches down to wherever the cursor has progressed. I've uninstalled, restarted, logged back in with the same result. I'm using notepad now, sadly.",0
"I've loved using Wunderlist. Now I'm being forced to use a different app that takes longer to load my lists, it takes an extra click to move an item from one list to another, and you can't change the look of it like we could in Wunderlist. It's little things, but the speed and simplicity are what make a to-do list app useful in the first place. I might have used this app if it could load my tasks as quick as Wunderlist already does.",0
"If you share a list with someone, it hardly ever syncs between users. My wife and I tried to use this for a grocery list after Microsoft killed Wunderlist. The horrible syncing means if someone adds an item to the list, the other person won't see it when they are at the store. Also, Wunderlist was so easy to add a person and share a list. It's a total PITA to share a list now. You basically have to send an invite through text or emai, then you need to log in using a Microsoft account.",0
Why did you have to ruin a good thing Microsoft. Wunderlist was perfect until you came along. The primary reason why I enjoyed Wunderlist was for it's flawless widget. When you checked off a task from the widget it would simply disappear. But you guys can't seem to do the same thing. Worse part is that your widget glitches out after completing a task (it's more like a 'twitch') like it's trying to get rid of it but can't. Didn't you guys buy the program? Why did you have to change it?,0
Sbasically does what you want it to. However you will get notifications everyday. Even after you go into settings and turn them off. the next day you still get notifications and you see in the settings that the notification setting that you turned off is turned back on. Have been doing this every day and nothing changes. so you will be stuck getting notifications you don't want everyday. They are hell-bent on making sure this app gives you notifications no matter what your choice. That is wrong.,0
"I like what its trying to do and want to use it, but it's missing a few things. To-Do doesn't support formatting AT ALL (mobile or PC), and any formatting you do in Outlook is erased and spacing is messed up. To-Do has the ability to create subtasks but doesn't translate over to Outlook. The To-Do app on PC doesn't allow you to enlarge the task/note window so your forced to type in this little box on the side of the window. PLEASE FIX THESE!!",0
"Not user friendly... Wunderlist was much better. I have several different lists and liked the ""All"" view from Wunderlist where I could see all the different tasks from all of my lists on one screen and I could easily move tasks between different lists. Now there is no ""All"" view and I have to open each individual list separately and go back and forth to see everything... I also can't move a task to another list. I'd have to open one list and copy the text then open the other list and paste...",0
The app is allowing flagged spam & junk mail into the app. There is no option to turn off unless you don't use this feature all together. I like to flag email option so this so is useless to me. I've tried to look for help regarding the issue but nobody seems to care. Should be a simple option to add. Just allow flagged email from my folders only and not my junk folder??,0
DANGEROUS - DON'T USE FOR THINGS YOU VALUE. I have seen items and entire lists disappear. Quick search online shows I'm not the only one. A task management app should be Auto saving after every character you type into a draft task. Working on your to-do list while disconnected from the internet should not cause problems. Until Microsoft can commit to the correct priorities I think I'm going to have to find an alternative.,0
"Migrated from Wunderlist, used this app for a few months with no issue, then it deleted all of my sub-lists and their content. The grocery list sucked, since I was at the store when I found they were deleted, but I can recreate those. However, I had movie and TV show recommendations from friends, family, and strangers going back almost ten years that I was slowly working through. They seem to be gone forever. Completely unacceptable. I will find an alternative and recommend everyone do the same.",0
"I've updated this review a half dozen times with various bugs; here we go again. Reported to customer support that when using the ""skip to current task"" feature on daily tasks, reminders don't get updated correctly sometimes, and will get set for some day in the future or past, sometimes MONTHS in the past. Received a useless condescending reply explaining that I have to complete daily tasks for the new instance of the task to appear. Engineers can't fix a bug they don't know about.",0
I will update my review when the basic features are fixed. I am extremely disappointed.I ran my warehouse floor with Wunderlist. I added tasks that needed to be done. They would automatically sink to the screens all around the warehouse and supervisors phones and everyone got an immediate notification. I switched everything and everyone over to this and I'll be lucky if one out of 15 screens syncs. Balls get dropped everyday over the last 3 weeks because notifications and syncing problems.,0
"They Ruined Wunderlist The day I got the email saying that Microsoft bought Wunderlist, I cried. That's 'cuz after 20 years of being an IT Manager, I know that everything MS touches turns to sewage. I got an email telling me I had to get my stuff out of Wunderlist by May 6. So I went to download it to my 2 Macs and it won't do it because I don't have the latest OS on my Macs. Correct. It has bugs Apple can't fix. I'll look for another to-do app and hope they don't acquire it 'cuz MS bites.",0
"I had Wunderlist, but it changed to Microsoft To Do. To Do is more clunky than Wunderlist. It does not currently group starred items by category. It does not have a variety of theme back grounds, and the sharing of lists with others had to be done list-by-list and was unnecessaryily time consuming. I am hoping to see significant improvements in thia app.",0
Bad transfer from Wunderlist. Resharing lists is time consuming. Order of items on lists is not preserved. Looks like it at first until you add something to a list and then it appears at the end/bottom of the list not at the top. Must then sort by order of creation date which throws everything out of wack if you had items ordered by importance or any other custom order.,0
"The app is absolutely great but with one very very painful flaw that makes it just unusable for me!! For the love of God, why does such an awesome Todo app doesn't have an option for recurring reminders ? When I can set recurring due dates for a task, why not recurring reminders? I haven't seen single other good Todo app, either free or paid that doesn't offer this feature. I cannot use this app anymore even though I really love it. An issue from years now, hope they fix it soon.",0
"I moved my data from wunderlist before the deadline. I used a Microsoft 365 account to set up my new to do account using a browser. It worked fine and I was able to access my lists. A week later to access Microsoft To Do but when I log in it says I can't access To Do because I don't have an exchange license. I have tried to log in both in my browser and the apps I downloaded with no luck. I can't access my data which is no longer in wunderlist, apparently no customer support for To Do.",0
"I have to give it a low rating because location based reminders have been ""on the list"" for two years and counting. This wouldn't be so bad except if you use Cortana, it uses this app for reminders, so you lose location based ability. Add location based reminders and this is a five star app.",0
"Was forced to migrate from Wunderlist. My husband and I both used Wunderlist extensively - sharing and updating lists. When we were force to migrate over, it migrated everything except the lists were not shared anymore. So when I updated my list, it does not update his list. I reshaped that list and it created a duplicate list for him. This is extremely annoying because we have to reshare EVERYTHING.",0
"Why don't daily tasks just work? It can't be that hard. It will push some daily tasks properly and one or two just will not show up. I'll confirm they're set for daily repeat but they'll show as due the day before... Despite being a daily task that's also due today? Super glitchy. Once fixed though, it's an otherwise great app. Daily tasks need to be fixed.",0
"Wunderlist was so good, but this app doesn't sync shared lists. When hubby and I used Wunderlist, he would add something to the shopping list and I would see it immediately. Shared list functionality seems like a one-off on this poor excuse for an app. You share it once, and any changes you make don't update the other person's list. I soooo badly miss my Wunderlist. Oh why did you desert us, Wunderlist? I would have gladly paid for a quality list app.",0
"The update to the app on about April 6th made the app much less useful since it took away the ability to alphabetically sort completed items. When you use the app for grocery items, the completed items no longer sort alphabetically thus adding frustration when sifting through hundreds of items to find the one you are looking for.",0
"Worst implemented app I have ever used. On first use it displayed every piece of SPAM that i have received over the past couple of years. I delete that stuff as soon as it arrives but I guess MS thinks that it's necessary to hold on to that stuff and put it into the Task app. You cannot bulk delete items, either. You have to go to each task item, select it, click the delete icon, then confirm deletion. THATS 3 STEPS for each and every item. This app is the biggest pain in the arse",0
"Ever since the January update that was supposed to fix sync issues my wife and I have had constant sync issues. Worked great before that update and would've given it 5 stars. Edit: If I could give this app 0 stars I would. Thought maybe an error occurred when the latest update was installed so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. When I try to log back in it brings me to a page that does not exist. Great, I can't even sign back in to my account....",0
"As a long time user of Wunderlist, this new replacement fails at the single most important thing next to holding taks: remind the user of said tasks. If a task comes up as due, I expect it to stay in notifications until I clear the task. Instead, To Do decided there's a time limit on how long a reminder stays on your notifications which means it isn't reminding you anymore which forces you to remember to open the app to see your tasks. This completely defeats the purpose of a reminder.",0
"I'm ok trying new apps. But, Microsoft purchased Wunderlist then forced us to use a much more complicated(shared lists) and unintuitive( access to said lists). My wife and I had a simple lists with about 8 shared lists. The shared lists lost access and had to send an invite to each list. Then I bought a new phone and ask shared settings were gone again. A simple task list should not be this difficult.",0
"This App used to be a simple and functional tool to share lists between people. Unfortunately, since Microsoft purchased the product and redesigned the interface the App is now virtually useless. My wife and I have constant sync issues and the interface is over complex. Way to ruin a great thing Microsoft.",0
I have to restart the app multiple times a day. It sucks. After the mandatory change from Wunderlist the app worked wothout issue until today. The app signed out of the MS account for some reason and it just kept crashing endlessly and prevented the use of my phone. Why? I also had to sign in multiple times to be able to get it right. Why change it fron Wunderlist to do a worse job? Why break something that was working?,0
I would really love for the new tasks to go to the top. I mean everything else is OK and this might sound kinda stupid but it kinda just throws everything off to not have that 1 little function. I mean if someone has this app downloaded then that alone says that they are probably smart enough to figure out how to arrange their list in order but it's just waaaaay too much work for something that is supposed to make our lives easier.,0
"Any app with task scheduling functionality should have basic sorting and scheduling features. This app does not. For example, if you have any task that needs to repeat monthly on every first Saturday of the month or simply sort by notification time, then you CAN'T use this app. It is simply INCAPABLE. I highly recommend a different app that can actually handle basic scheduling requirements.",0
"Notes field glitch. Auto entering at the bottom of the field, making it not usable. I'm tired of these half-baked updates. UPDATE: MS sugests not using the Samsung keyboard. So much for the stylus I bought for handwriting notes to text! I'd rather Microsoft calm down with all their apps that are supposed to make our lives better and just focus on making the basic ones actually work. So out of touch with the end users...",0
"EDIT: has been broken for months, repeated updates haven't fixed it. Stay on the list I want! Obviously have to get a new app. Microsoft ruined Wunderlist. Used to work fine. Now the widget (which is the only way I use the app) constantly sets itself to My Day (which I NEVER use) instead of the shopping list I want it to show. I fix it, and it eventually goes back to my day. I remove the widget and add it again, and the same thing happens. Wunderlist never did this!!!",0
It's supposed to replace Wunderlist but is missing several key features Wunderlist did. One feature I miss is the email notification if a team member completed a task or adds a task. Another silly thing is you have no option but to connect this to your Outlook calendar which I did not want. I don't see why these are features that couldn't be turned on or off.,0
"This App Was Great, Until It Wasn't. This app did what it was meant to do in syncing to do lists that I shared with others. It synced to all my devices and multi account was great to also have the to do list from my work. This recently the app started demanding me to sign into it repeatingly every 30 seconds. I tried every troubleshooting step including clearing cache and storage, reinstalling, different login methods. This issue won't go away and has made it unusable. Moving to a new platform.",0
"The reminder feature and due date features don't work - so what is the point of using this app? They often fail to appear on my notification tray. Overdue tasks disappear from it. I can set reoccurring due dates for tasks, but why can't I set reoccurring reminders for this task. There is a lot of potential here, but this app is still too unpolished.",0
Never really had any issues with this app until last few months. The app has become very glitchy and does not operate smoothly like it has. Been using it flawlessly for the last couple of years since it switched over from WOUNDERLIST. The WOUNDERLIST APP Was Awesome! Well Microsoft I use this app to operate a business and I'm now moving on to a different app. This glitch is so bad that they are wanting me to contact customer support by going through the settings in the app and it won't even open,0
"Cons: Suggestions still continually turn themselves back on, now every time I open a list, despite being manually turned off *individually*! I have around 30 lists! This problem gets worse each update. No way to turn off Suggestions all at once in settings. Also, syncing between users isnt working and my spouse often can't see items I added until a day later even when manually synced. Also, a microsoft account is required for support or feedback. Pros: At least it has dark mode now.",0
Was forced to switch to this from wunderlist. The only thing better about it is dark mode that extends to widgets. Everything else sucks. I now don't even get about 30% of my reminders anymore and have to constantly reset things. Microsoft is one of the richest companies on Earth and this is the best they can do? Edit: changing to one star and giving up. I don't even get 75% of my reminders from this app anymore it's so poorly designed. I hate that they took over wunderlist.,0
"I do not want my entries deleted when they are marked complete. I have ""confirm before deleting"" toggled on in Settings. I want the item marked complete and to stay on the list shaded out or with a line through it so I can see what has been done. Otherwise I don't know if it even was ever on the list! That is a huge plus for Color Note. Sharing isn't helpful if I can't track what's been done.",0
"Update: decreased from 2 to 1 star. The reminder functionality is terrible. If I set a reminder on a recurring task, I want the reminder to recur as well. I miss Wunderlist. The functionality is so different now, and the transition was really bad. And I definitely didn't want a Microsoft account.",0
"I like the idea of this hat but it has some major issues that need to be resolved: 1. Clicking onOneNote links will automatically download that section of OneNote from the internet, instead of opening it on the locally installed program. 2. Flagged email Categories do not appear here as they do in the PWA. 3. If there is a flagged email automatically added to my day because of its due date, when I mark it as complete, it does not show as completed at the bottom. This needs to change.",0
"I forget what the original app was called, but after Microsoft replaced it with this, it has been nothing but a nightmare of having to login 50 different ways in order to look at a list... A list! Just let this be local data on my phone, instead of on the cloud (make that an option instead of the default, if anything). There should be no reason that something as simple as a list for personal use should require all this authentication or be stored on anything other than mine and invited devices.",0
"'For Today' screen is deleting tasks instead of adding them to 'My Day' when I click on the '+' icon. This is getting worse. Every time I use the app, items get deleted instead of added to my day. And at least one is lost because I missed that it deleted instead of added it. It is ridiculous that tapping on the '+' registers as a delete at all. Pixel 2 XL",0
"Ruined a great app üò≠ with poor & insanely annoying password management. Forced to transfer to this after they bought Wunderlist. Not compatible with Android's security manager, so I need to remember my password. Lame. So I reset it, but it says I'm reusing the previous password, so I'm obviously typing it correctly. Still doesn't work. Now I have to go to some lame Microsoft site, so they can harvest my cell#. And then I can finally make a shopping list. Because security? Stupid.",0
"Mar 2020: Very, very disappointing. Looking elsewhere. Before:A move forward from Wunderlist? Not! MS made sure the UI looked different (with useless themes) and DROPPED Wunderlist functionality like 1) email delivery (marked stuff in Outlook is USELESS to people that don't use it), 2) no way to add tasks by widget/notifications, 3) marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top, 4) ""My Day"" shows up rather than a task list. 5) ... (out of review space) I detest ""progress"" that isn't.",0
I was kicked off of Todo. Your system did not recognize my password on my Chromebook and my phone. I finally gained access using my tablet. I am terrified of continuing with this app. I have a lot of data that would hurt if I lose it. My attempts to contact you on line just sent me around in circles. I need reliability and will have to find another app as much as I like Todo. Your customer service needs enhancing.,0
"This was a fine app until more integrations and ""smart"" features were added. STOP re-enabling ""auto suggestions."" I'll make my own to do lists, thanks. It wouldn't be so bad if it stayed off once I turn it off, but it is inexplicably turned back on every time I close and reopen the app. BRING BACK WUNDERLIST",0
"To Do list cant be shown on widget. Only the myday can be, which i dont want to use. There are better options. microsoft refuses to use common sense agsin with this app. Your to do item needs to be less than about 15 words in order to view it. while editing the item you can write 50 words or more, but after saving you cant view it completely because the scroll doesnt function well enough. 75% of the screen real estate (like most microsoft sw) is wasted.",0
"Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an ""assigned to me"" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating.",0
"Not nearly as good as wunderlist was and I don't like that I had to switch...constant issues that I didn't have (or not nearly as much if I did). It often doesn't sync with my partner who I share multiple lists with and lately it has an issue even creating a shared list. When I create a list and try to share it with him it says ""we ran into a problem creating a link to share"" but offers no solution on how to try to fix the issue. Bring back wunderlist!!!!!",0
"I'll pile on with the ""this app isn't as good as Wunderlist"" crowd. My wife and I specifically chose Wunderlist after experiencing frustrating bugs in Google keep not keeping our shared lists in sync. Now we have switched to Microsoft To Do, since they're retiring Wunderlist, and we are back to the same frustrating bugs of our shared lists getting our of sync üò†. Also, the experience for sharing a list is terrible. Very much a downgrade from Wunderlist.",0
"Disappointed that Wunderlist is gone because it took me years to find a task app that met my needs. The feature I miss most is being able to select Sort By Date, then manually reordering items within each date afterward. Right now I can only do one or the other. If I select sort by date, I cannot manually reorder items. If I turn off the sort by date option, I have to manually move each item.",0
"UPDATED: I used to have this rated 4 stars until the most recent update which has issues with website addresses. Now every time you go into a note with a web address it doubles it each time you write anything and exit. PREVIOUS 4 STAR REVIEW: I was an hugh supporter of Listmaster, but they went out of business. This app does even more, except I would like to see some type of an import / export feature using csv files (for file backup).",0
"I made the switch after the Wunderlist got taken down. My biggest gripe with this (and it is big) is the widget is very very slow to update lists or when switching lists. There is a 5-10 second delay when adding things or switching, and Wunderlist never had this problem. This has been an issue since day 1. I exclusively use the widget since it's very easy to navigate to and see my lists. If this problem was mitigated it would be a good app.",0
This app was AMAZING as wunderlist. Then Microsoft got hold of it and now I cant get in because of password issues. Didnt want a Microsoft a count but had to to keep this app so I signed up....nope all of my stuff is transferred but no access without logging on using a browser. Microsoft did you miss the point of having a simple phone app?,0
"Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying.",0
"Error: Local updates are no longer pushed to the server. Obviously, this completely breaks the synchronisation feature. Changed from 5-star to 1-star. Signed out & reinstalled the android app, it downloads the old list and still doesn't push local updates. Signed out on desktop, re-installed, same story. Something is broken server side. Could not find support for this issue. Too bad. I will develop my own synchronized list solution. ""Fine, I'll do it myself"" - Thanos",0
"I've been using this app for a month now. For the most part it works well, love the checklist function and reminders. But I am trying to establish routines so I need to tweak my schedule sometimes. I wish there was an option to move or reschedule recurring tasks around, and the ability to duplicate them so I'm not starting from scratch each time I need to add something new. Could be more user friendly and organized, it's been very frustrating to use at times.",0
Good,0
Only five habits allowed. They don't tell you that.,0
"I opened the app and am uninstalling it as soon as I opened it. This may work for certain things so it's worth giving it a try. However, this is not what I was looking for at all. Im searching for an app to use as a universal all-in-one track and logger that has many functions and can be customized easily. I was hoping for 1. Track water and food, medication tracker and reminder (so I could also track the supplements I take and write a note), will keep looking for a good fit.",0
"No option to create an actual ""routine"".",0
*very* limited features without purchasing the premium package,0
It is neat but not enough free features. :/,0
I am facing a problem . I have tried a lot fix it but can't. My timer for any activity stops or freazes when I turned off screen and start when I turned on screen .,0
"Can't find where to stop auto renew. Not in Google Play store, not in app. settings. I like the app, just want to try it for a month, but I can't find where to unsubscribe from. Can a Habit Now staff reply to this? Thank you.",0
Can't create checklists or use the widget to mark items done without getting premium. It's the only two things I needed so not a good fit.,0
Fine if you abide by it,0
The first feature I tried to use needed an upgrade. Uninstalled.,0
App doesnt let you select specific alarm sound for specific habit. Theres only one alarm sound for all habits which is super lame.,0
Difficult to navigate as there are no tutorials and looks complicated. Reminders and alarms do not work at all and it's very limited in use. Overrated honestly.,0
"Fine, but the free version doesn't give me what I need",0
"Looking for an app that doesn't Collect Any of my Personal Data. At least you don't share with third parties, that's why 2 stars. Uninstalled.",0
The app is really cool but almost everything goes in it with the premium,0
"Not very useful, unfortunately. I tried just adding habits for my morning and evening routines, at first, and they can't just be added by putting ""routine"" in, thus using 1 out of my 5 custom slots, because it won't let me add ""routine"" to my schedule twice a day. At this rate, I can't use the app enough for free, to know what it would be like to pay. Only 3 more slots won't help me as much as carrying a post it note. The app is pretty and I couldn't find a privacy policy or terms of service.",0
Cannot add many habits on free plan,0
"I wanted to purchase premium but I noticed an issue.... If I have already tracked a habit, and then change the settings of habit (say changing the minimum time feature)... The statistics doesn't update",0
Widgets are only functional with premium. You can only use the light theme one but cannot check off or do anything other than view tasks without premium. Anything else I tried to do prompted me to get premium,0
Pehla jesha nhi rha app after update,0
kinda hard to use,0
"This habit tracker is free, but only as a 'trial' in order to convince the consumer to pay for the $5 premium version. If you don't pay for the premium version, you cannot test any features advertised nor sync your cloud data.",0
"In this app you can make a task template that can be reused over and over. However you need to pick a set frequency for it to appear. You can't pick a single day for it to appear. So the easy fix to this is to create a single non recurring task, but you have to start from scratch and that sucks if it's big task with alot of subtasks that have to be typed in again. It would be perfect if you could make a template for nonrecurring tasks that can be give a different time/alarm every time its used.",0
widget s√≥ pra premium,0
"I'm paid for the premium version and now I'm experiencing buyer's remorse. The only reason why I tried this app is because Loop Habit Tracker hasn't been in active development for around 2 years. Even so, this app pales in comparison! It's ugly, it's clunky, and it doesn't graphically present data in the most elegant and useful form. Don't get me wrong, it's okay for people who like messy interfaces and sloppy data presentation ‚Äî people easy to please. ‚Ä¶I may just have to make my own app.",0
You have to pay unless you need just a few tasks,0
your stopwatch is not accurate it is slow and late as compared to any other regular watch,0
Simplify it,0
"I initially found this app very useful, so I upgraded to the premium version for the automatic backup feature. When I got a new phone and transferred all of my data to the new device, I discovered none of my backups had actually occurred and over two years of habit tracking data had been lost.",0
"The app is functional, but entering habits feels cumbersome. Simplifying this process would enhance user experience. While features are comprehensive, streamlining them would improve usability. Simplification is key to making the app more user-friendly and efficient. The app is effective, but entering habits and other details feels time-consuming. Simplifying the process would enhance user experience. While features are robust, streamlining them would make navigation easier.",0
"I just made the lifetime purchase. The app is a great deal if you want to improve your life. The App is well focused. I suggest you add area for NOTES. I know it may be a little bit outside what you've done but I think u should make your users stick to your app only. Let's Keep Notes in the App. In the Notes, we can attach links, have check boxes, thumbnails etc. as you think fast. Thank you. Please Update. You have my 5 star ‚≠ê afterwards.",0
"Buttons on the widget don't work if you're not premium. Some widgets require premium even though they are not named as such. The distinction between tasks and habits seems pointless. It should just be a checkbox on the habit to disable tracking. If the usabily was streamlined by fixing the above I'd reconsider using the app, but as it is, it's just frustrating.",0
Premium needed to use unlimited tasks. dont need to explain anymore,0
Glitchey,0
"It has a limit of seven tasks/habits, if hou don't have the premium version",0
"Have to pay to do more than like 10 tasks, really inefficient. Otherwise I really like the app. It seemed super simple and straightforward.",0
I would have given 5 stars and I was going to buy premium but then I realised it is not having sign in feature. Please implement the basic Google sign in so that our progress is synced across multiple devices and our purchase is linked with our email I'd.,0
"Pushy denial. I placed FIVE tasks in, then was told repeatedly that I had to purchase premium to make any habit reoccurring. I'm sorry, I thought the idea of a habit is that it IS reoccurring. Too bad, too. It had promise. Idea: let people use full service for a month, then decide if they want to pay for it.",0
It was good...until they tell you AFTER that you're maxed out at only 3 tasks and have to buy premium to continue.,0
"I downloaded it for the checklist, opened it and discovered I had to get premium to use... The basic checklist. I mean the habit tracker and all that looked cool, but...",0
"The app doesn't send notifications like it says it will, I don't know if it's an issue of permissions but I can't give it any. The fact that it can't notify me makes it basically useless.",0
"I don't get notifications and reminders from it, I missed my other schedule because of that. My cell phone battery is not optimized and I'm surprised because all my reminders and notifications are allowed, nothing happened. I just neglected my tasks. please fix it.",0
I have been using for past 2 years....i like it,0
Only allowed 7 habits before it cost money,0
"Great app, really like it. Will change to 5 stars when the below bug is fixed: -The sort order in the first tab of the app, and in all the widgets, doesn't work. No matter what sort option I use it gets jumbled. Bonus - in the Habits tab, if I have 10 habits I have to scroll down to the bottom to edit a habit. When I exit the editor I'm automatically brought to the top of the Habits tab. Which means if I want to edit habits 8, 9 & 10 I have to scroll down again each time.",0
"Originally liked it, but it gets too ""head heavy"" - not enough tracking data to overlook all habits... Would help if there were graphs to show all habits in a single view, rather than having to go through every single habit (time consuming). So time consuming to the point where I'm unable to continue using it (paid for premium too). Other than that it's a good app if you have time to go through all habits one by one.

Can you add more icons to allow users to use icons that are relevant to habit being created please.,0
its complicated im sorry,0
Anyone else having issues with the app alerting you when you set the alarm? I have had 1 time where the alarm worked. The other times I've set the alarm and I get no notification. I would love this app if it alerted me to do the task. Thanks.,0

"It's generally great, but this app would have been a five star had I not experienced alarm problems. The alarm would randomly malfunction and when I click on the app to check it, it suddenly rings 2 hours or more than the intended time. This set me way off ,you better check on this.",0
Alarm doesn't work for habits. For tasks sometimes it works only with vibration. Brought the paid version and waste of money.,0
This app sends notifications even when Do Not Disturb is on. Turning off notifications inside the app doesn't work either. I will have to uninstall to attend meetings an events. Pixel 3XL.,0
Good app but could use some in app help or documentation. E.g what does an x on a task mean vs check vs blank? Emailed the developer but did not hear back.,0
Notifications not coming on!! Yes all the notifications settings are ON both on the phone and on the app. When I open the app all the notifications come up....late. wish it would work properly,0
"Edit: still don't have a way to change my ""default"" alarm tone without a third party app, and I'd still like to set different tones and reminders per task. Second edit: all the notifications and alarms seem to happen either regularly three minutes late, or, if I haven't turned on my phone screen in a while, as late as 4 pm for a 9 am reminder.

"Edit: Initially gave it 4.5 stars. The app itself still works fine, but the sync stopped working about a year ago. That's the main reason I paid for the premium version. I messaged the developer about it and never heard back. Wonder if it's been abandoned by the developer?",0
The widget is becoming unresponsive multiple times and the only solution is to remove the widget and add it again. Please fix this..,0
"Why does it delete all previous logs if I change a habit from 3 to 4 times per week? And can there be an option to track a habit cumulatively? E.g. I want to do something for a total of 1hr per week, but I fail the habit if I do it 45 mins on one day and 15 mins on another day",0

"It seems like a good app but only offers 5 habits to track on the free version. I'll stick with it for now and see if it is helpful over the 66 recommended days, but might uninstall if I feel the need to monitor further habits.",0
"Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra.",0
"Reminders only pop up when I remember to open the app, which defeats the whole purpose. If the reminders popped up automatically at the set times, I'd give the app 5 stars.",0
Works OK on Galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications. Can't even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts. In the end all data lost and so am I.,0
"Free version allows only up to 5 habits to be added, but app description doesn't mention it. Had to spend an hour setting up habits then uninstall the app and find a new one.",0
"Had annoyances with the UI, the font was too big for me and I couldn't see a lot of things at once. And for all its gimmicks, it's really just a simple app.",0
"Widget Request: please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget? Or an option that removes done tasks from the widget.   Good job on the app otheriwise, I'll repurchase if you can add this, love the snooze function.",0

"I was alerted that my password was exposed in a security breaches by from this app from Google. So I went to the app, logged in, and it told me the same thing: my password was breached. So I pressed ok. Then, it had logged me back out. So, I retyped my log in, and it told me that my username wasn't in the data base.??? But I just logged in with that very username. Now I'd like to just completely get rid of my account from this app, but I can't log in to do so, and my password is breached. HELP",0
"Very basic app with no motivation to actually keep on with habits. Its very boring, might as well hang a calendar on my wall and mark crosses. Try some gasification guys! Make it fun!",0
Won't allow me to register or make an account. Tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear! Not the best trial!,0
"Good app, but lousy customer service. I emailed the developer 3 times about my problem syncing on iOS but no replies given at all. Paid for lifetime account but starting from zero there. If you see this (customer service) this 2 stars is your fault.",0
"This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.",0
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.,0
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.,0
Love the app. Would love a version for Windows/Chrome to use on PC. Also I bought a premium version and now when I opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non-premium version.,0
"Don't try to compel people to purchase, allure them to do so. Completely hiding the widgets under the premium plan is a step in wrong direction. People don't easily purchase till they easily come to know the worthiness of an app. PS: I had purchased Habitbull 2 years back with a different Google account. But now using another app - simple and with nice widgets.",0
"It is a good app for statistical tracking of habits, but you can't back up your progress unless you get premium, which is absolutely absurd. I'll stick with my notebook, thanks.",0
"The tracker itself is not bad but I set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them. I already checked my settings, all is good. It's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working.",0
It would be 5 stars if you fixed the checklist widget. It is unresponsive unless I remove it and add it again every time I want to check something off. Use some of that one-time-fee I gave you to fix that please. Actively looking for alternatives.,0
"I really like this app. Enough to purchase the premium a few years back, but the app didn't update to premium for me, and there was no response when I contacted the support. Seems like I'm not alone in this experience. Don't put your trust in the developers!",0
"It's still shows Habit Bull for me. I had put reminders and now they don't work at all. Uninstalled and downloaded again, still doesn't work. It doesn't do the minimal work it's required to do.....",0
"Although i like using this app, everytime i click on the Sign Up option, the app crashes and closes. I know one of these days the app is going to malfunction and I'm going to lose all my data. Please help me with this. My device is Samsung Galaxy M2",0
"Widget freezes, app does not sync. I had a galaxy S7 edge and just got an S10+. App fails with both phones. Regret spending money on this.",0
It used to be the best habit tracker app but now home screen of the app is glitching.. the screen brightness suddenly decreases..,0
"Like others have said in here, the widget freezes and then you have to delete it and re-add it to work again, even a phone reset won't get it going",0
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.,0
I have added 5 habits but It does not send me any notification or reminders. I have even changed the setting for unrestricted access but in vain. Useless app.,0
"The free version is OK, I have very serious problems with a subscription service where new customers content or updates aren't provided monthly.",0
The widgets do not work. Please add auto back and provide some analytics/graphs on the habits management and formation.,0
Sync no longer works. Also app has been buggy lately - closes down and does not respond. I'm now using Loop Habit Tracker which is more stable.,0
"great app but waaay to complicated, deleted it and replaced with a different simpler app. interface looks cool though.",0
"I buy the platinum app, but the reminders doesn't work!!! Please fix it! . It's a great app but the reminders are very important to me.",0
none of the notifications work. other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix. the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications,0
Used to work great. Couldn't export my data and support never answered my email so ending up changing to a different app.,0
"Hello Habitbull team, I need to check all features in premium version so can you give me access to premium version for 2 days so that I can try all features and check if the feature that I need is present or not and then buy premium version.",0
Notifications don't work making it difficult to track habits because I don't have the habit of tracking habits. It's a vicious cycle.,0
"Password reset is broken, cannot transfer it to a new cell phone. Think twice before buying this app. The habit-related side is good, however - this is why I bought it.",0
"Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb. What expert would ever say that insults are motivational? Almost none. I'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness, not shaming.",0
"I like that it allows specific habits, I don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits. after using it about a month i deleted it, because even though i was doing almost every habit 100%, it kept giving me <50%. it was demoralizing.",0
"confusing UI, lack of options and navigation.. tried using it for a long time but it proved useless. Never got any reminders which I set",0
"I like this app, I bought the premium version last year and I still can't synchronize my data, I have to change my phone and I will lose all the data! Could you fix that?",0
it's not worth the premium. I tried to get a refund because it wasn't what I thought it would be and no one has contacted me. They claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer. I will be deleting this app and regretting the $8 purchase,0
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.,0
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.,0
Not fully accessible for screen reader user like me. Requesting to the developer to fix it.,0
Hello I have downloaded it and what it shows on the app store page it's different I can't see images it's just plain and the photos never appear. Is it to do with settings ??,0
Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.,0
"Fine for tracking, but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks (this has happened with every new habit I've set up, and I have a premium account) and the developer doesn't respond to support requests.",0
"I will give 2 star's, i liked this app initially so much, i used to have 5 habbits. But once i did the new update, i lost all my progress and this app doesn't let you to sync to your mail in free version. So i lost all my progress...this is soo commercial app, it's not free at all. So better don't download.",0
"Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app.",0
"It felt well build and easy to use, the tracking system could be better, since it has a yes or no day (maybe something in the middle sometimes things happen) the others are measure number you can introduce. The only part I did not liked, was that the website said it was free and i just let you use 5 habits then you have to pay 10,00‚Ç¨/monthly !!! It feels like a scam if it says it is for free and then in is not.",0
"Been a premium user for a few years, but after this last update the notifications have stopped working. I've checked all the settings on my phone, emailed the developers no response. What good is a habit reminder app if the notifications don't work? If they get back to me and fix the problem I will revise this review.",0
"I liked the app and I purchased it. But I can't sync any data from old phone. And when logged out of the app, there is no way to login again except reinstall the app. So if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone, this app is for you. But since I like to keep my progress to the new phone, I am stop using this app and find another one.",0
"This was my habit tracker of choice but the Android widget does not work, when I add it to my home screen I cannot click any of the habits to mark them as complete, it's just a view of status. I still need to open the app to interact with a habit which makes the widget useless in my opinion.",0
"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium.",0
"It seems like this app is no longer supported. I've paid for premium, but sync stopped working several months ago, and developers have not replied to a support request. So - on moving to a new phone - my habits and streaks are now lost. I can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue. I guess the app has now been abandoned.",0
"EDIT: Also, the name and icon of the app are now different in the Google Play store versus on my phone. This is confusing -- has the app changed owners and/or is it being upgraded? Unfortunately this app has suddenly stopped working. The streaks don't work any more - - even though I have ticked the days, the chained circles don't appear on the calendar, and all my streaks show as 0. Have been using the paid version of the app for about a year and this just happened this past week.",0
"It does the job... barely. The UI is an absolute disaster. Buggy, inconsistent, and hard to navigate. The app itself works as advertised, but if you're looking for a habit tracking app I suggest looking on other options which aren't the app equivalent of wearing sunglasses with spikes on them. And if you do end up choosing this, I wouldn't rely too much on the log in to save my data. Haven't tried that myself but it seems to be on par with the reset of the user experience.",0
"Man, this app is great. Simple but complete, which makes it very effective. Customization options for habits are excellent and connecting to specific communities a huge plus. Highly recommended if you want to keep track of your progress towards a goal! Updated: logging features are still as good as ever, but since syncing is impossible, I can't see the forum anymore as my user doesn't properly log in and there is no customer service, I can't recommend it anymore...",0
"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!",0
"I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.",0
"This is a great habit tracker that I keep coming back to use when I want to track things. The visuals are great and the information you can put into what you track and each day as a note is very nice to keep track of small details if you want. Unfortunately, the widgets don't seem to work properly anymore, so currently, it is not the most effective habit tracker to use now.",0
"After changing my email, I cannot use HabitBull's premium features. I have tried emailing support--no response--and finding a way to restore the purchase or even purchase it again, but no such luck. I am forever stuck with the app thinking I have pro, even though I do not. It's a shame, really, for what is otherwise a fantastic app.",0
"The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone.",0
"I loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying. I paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both iOS and Android. After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful. I still hope someone can help me fix this or I should get a refund for my purchase.",0
"Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.",0
"Premium version doesn't seem to be supported anymore. Multiple emails have not been answered. Online support is extremely limited. Widgets no longer work unless you open the app, and sometimes even then you have to take an action or two within the app. The usual fixes don't work: The app doesn't even support logging out, anymore. The usual uninstall/reinstall didn't work.",0
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,0
"App is good. But i got the premieum just for the widgets. Unfortunately they don't work ! Most of the time they are unclickable, whatever item i press on the widget, no action occurs, I can-t record my habit doing. I need help with this.",0
This app has been charging me money every month without me knowing. Even after I uninstalled it.,0
"App is very good for what it is, but the sync feature stopped working for me. The FAQ says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non-rooted phones. HabitBull offers no support to fix. 2 stars bec it works standalone, but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure.",0
"While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.",0
I've tried a few and this is the best habit app. Simple and effective. Notifications work great and has helped me stay on track for many things Update 11/5/23: sad to see that notifications have stopped working. It was a great app but I am letting it go,0
"I picked up this app because I wanted a calendar widget to help me keep track of multiple tasks throughout the week. I was surprised to learn I needed to pay a subscription for widget control, however I was okay with that since it offered what I was looking for. Sadly the widget barely works. Trying to tap the widget typically does nothing, so then I need to delete the widget and re-add in order to get it working properly. I'm so frustrated by this, I will likely be cancelling my subscription",0
"Can't choose when to start. I like setting goals/habits for advance dates once I'm done with one+. Also, you can't edit a habit/goal to start over, you have to delete and start new. Doesn't save your previous habits/goals to do again.",0
"I would not recommend this app bc of an essential flaw in design - it doesn't allow you to just type in habit, instead it quizzes you. So, a simple act of just typing what you'd like to do turns into this crazy and overly complicated thing.",0
"Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned.",0
"Seems like it could be very helpful. Getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though I have weekly view selected in settings. Even tried switching it, but no matter what opens on monthly",0
I love the ease of the application and the setup. I don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame-based. it doesn't make me want to try any harder when I get scolded for not fulfilling my goals. positive encouragement as the best way.,0
I like the overall app. It is the best. But even after setting the reminder for my habits. I do not receive any notification or reminder. I have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on.,0
"***Had to uninstall to find where to sign in, only for the app to shutdown.*** Gave this a go again in hopes I could at least screenshot all the habit suggestions they have to offer so I could make a list to use elsewhere & was able to. Logging in last time the app worked had it shut down & nothing worked for weeks. Here's to hoping the app working sticks this time.",0
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.,0
Reminders are not working. I have an Asus ZenFone 4 (shouldn't matter) and I have set the reminders multiple times with no success. I feel this is the most important part of this app as I need reminding in order to affectively create a habit. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. My rating my change after feedback.,0
"On one hand, this app is simple to use and I like being able to easily update the status for multiple habits and for several days at a time if I forget to check things off every day. However, it seems that the developers have abandoned this app. The community discussion and inspirational images features are broken, and the last update was a year ago, so there seems to be no interest in fixing them. What used to set this app apart from the others is no longer there.",0
"Used to be a great app, but I've moved phones, but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost. Even after having paid $18 for premium. Very much a shame.",0
"This app has not been functioning this week, it has not been reminding me on any of my habits... super frustrating!!! I loved this tracker and now I may have to look into another üò¨ I've tried deleting, reseting, uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing. But if you remember on your own you can put it in and it'll keep track",0
"Worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders. The reminders would pop up if I opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder. Also, froze a lot. Pretty much useless. When it worked, it was excellent.",0
I am not happy. I paid for the premium app without the ads so that I could have more than 5 habits. Then I end up breaking my phone so I had to replace it. When I reinstalled the app I lost my premium status which I paid for. I emailed Habitbull requesting they restore my status because I already paid for the premium version. I even attachrd a copy of my receipt to the email to prove I paid for the permium version. No response. I contacted them months ago. Nothing. I do not recommend this app.,0
"I had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up. Ever since then I've not got notifications at all, no matter if I try reset them or whatever. Kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so I keep forgetting to take my medication.",0
"Too much configuration, not very intuitive, I'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day, not to set goals, reminders, notes, and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen, not looking for enterprise app just for personal use.",0
"It's misleading to list data export as a reason to buy Premium, when it is not included with Premium. It would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system. Additionally, the Platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33% off. The greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33% off price. Will give higher star review when these are fixed..",0
"Advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress. In reality, they don't let you access that feature without a premium membership. I don't mind paying for features and services, but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty. I'd recommend finding a FOSS habit tracker.",0
"The app is decent enough, but it does not send notifications to remind you to use the app etc. I can see other reviews with the same problem being brought up. I have messaged the developer multiple times to address it, but they have failed to respond so I will find another app to use.",0
"I like the interface especially the ability to mark as complete, skip or remove the status of tasks. However $AU6.99 per month is was too high a price and there is no ability to buy a discounted annual or lifetime subscription. I had to reluctantly pass on purchase.",0
"Bummed. I downloaded and excitedly upgraded to premium. However, my habits show up as a broken image link, so I can't actually see which habits I'm updating or tracking. Heck, I can't even edit them. I updated my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and the problem persists. Any ideas?",0
"I love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit, other apps force you to commit to specific days, the flexibility in this app helps me succeed, what I hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion-for example I did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day. way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull!",0

Won't allow me to register or make an account. Tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear! Not the best trial!,0
"Like others have said in here, the widget freezes and then you have to delete it and re-add it to work again, even a phone reset won't get it going",0
Reminders are not on time!,0
"It seems like a good app but only offers 5 habits to track on the free version. I'll stick with it for now and see if it is helpful over the 66 recommended days, but might uninstall if I feel the need to monitor further habits.",0
Like many premium users I received an automated email letting me know that following a bug my password was reset. After that impossible to use the premium features any more. Developer doesn't respond. Such a shame!,0
The widgets do not work. Please add auto back and provide some analytics/graphs on the habits management and formation.,0
It is difficult to understand,0
The user interface is not user friendly No one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder Make it simple and easy to understand man,0
"I really like the app, but I wish that I could slowly increase my goals without losing my streak.",0
No quotes,0
"The app is decent enough, but it does not send notifications to remind you to use the app etc. I can see other reviews with the same problem being brought up. I have messaged the developer multiple times to address it, but they have failed to respond so I will find another app to use.",0
The moderation of the discussion boards in the app leaves something to be desired. Needs better moderation.,0
The user interface is not user friendly No one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder Make it simple and easy to understand man,0
"I will give 2 star's, i liked this app initially so much, i used to have 5 habbits. But once i did the new update, i lost all my progress and this app doesn't let you to sync to your mail in free version. So i lost all my progress...this is soo commercial app, it's not free at all. So better don't download.",0
"It is a good app for statistical tracking of habits, but you can't back up your progress unless you get premium, which is absolutely absurd. I'll stick with my notebook, thanks.",0
"Premium version doesn't seem to be supported anymore. Multiple emails have not been answered. Online support is extremely limited. Widgets no longer work unless you open the app, and sometimes even then you have to take an action or two within the app. The usual fixes don't work: The app doesn't even support logging out, anymore. The usual uninstall/reinstall didn't work.",0
I bought premium long time ago. But this year I am unable to export my results.,0
I couldn't create an account to sign in. Export isn't working too.,0
Can't even write your own habits in. You have to pick from their list of like eight different habits and that's all there is.,0
It says that my current streak is 0 even though I've completed every one of the past 14 days :(,0
Unfortunately you can't track more than 5 habits with the free version,0
Notification have stopped working,0
I have added 5 habits but It does not send me any notification or reminders. I have even changed the setting for unrestricted access but in vain. Useless app.,0
It used to be the best habit tracker app but now home screen of the app is glitching.. the screen brightness suddenly decreases..,0
Notification stopped working after an update several weeks ago and it is still not resolved.,0
Not fully accessible for screen reader user like me. Requesting to the developer to fix it.,0
I've tried a few and this is the best habit app. Simple and effective. Notifications work great and has helped me stay on track for many things Update 11/5/23: sad to see that notifications have stopped working. It was a great app but I am letting it go,0
"No me funciona, seg√∫n pongo alarmas y NUNCA suenan... no se puede hacer check desde el widget",0
Great app. Widget for weekly view does not work on my S8 unless I tick habits from the app itself,0
"This is a great habit tracker that I keep coming back to use when I want to track things. The visuals are great and the information you can put into what you track and each day as a note is very nice to keep track of small details if you want. Unfortunately, the widgets don't seem to work properly anymore, so currently, it is not the most effective habit tracker to use now.",0
This worked well for me for years and then the notifications stopped working. I've tinkered with my phone settings and the app settings a number of times and no luck. It's basically useless now since the notifications were my trigger to complete my tasks.,0
"Been a premium user for a few years, but after this last update the notifications have stopped working. I've checked all the settings on my phone, emailed the developers no response. What good is a habit reminder app if the notifications don't work? If they get back to me and fix the problem I will revise this review.",0
Suddenly cannot interact with widgets now. Tried reinstalling multiple times to no avail,0
"This was my habit tracker of choice but the Android widget does not work, when I add it to my home screen I cannot click any of the habits to mark them as complete, it's just a view of status. I still need to open the app to interact with a habit which makes the widget useless in my opinion.",0
"Hi, I like this app but the notifications do not work at all.",0
Can't even write your own habits in. You have to pick from their list of like eight different habits and that's all there is.,0
didn't like the software,0
"Don't try to compel people to purchase, allure them to do so. Completely hiding the widgets under the premium plan is a step in wrong direction. People don't easily purchase till they easily come to know the worthiness of an app. PS: I had purchased Habitbull 2 years back with a different Google account. But now using another app - simple and with nice widgets.",0
"Very basic app with no motivation to actually keep on with habits. Its very boring, might as well hang a calendar on my wall and mark crosses. Try some gasification guys! Make it fun!",0
You have to pay to track more than 5 habits.,0
"On one hand, this app is simple to use and I like being able to easily update the status for multiple habits and for several days at a time if I forget to check things off every day. However, it seems that the developers have abandoned this app. The community discussion and inspirational images features are broken, and the last update was a year ago, so there seems to be no interest in fixing them. What used to set this app apart from the others is no longer there.",0
"The app hasn't been updated for over a year, the link for the motivational images is broken, can't sync my account, the user forum is no longer there... I have a premium account and previously give 5 stars for the app but the developer really needs to update it and keep it functional.",0
Notifications don't work,0
"Used to be a fantastic app, HabitBull. ¬£5 Month for widgets?",0
Bad ui,0
"I was alerted that my password was exposed in a security breaches by from this app from Google. So I went to the app, logged in, and it told me the same thing: my password was breached. So I pressed ok. Then, it had logged me back out. So, I retyped my log in, and it told me that my username wasn't in the data base.??? But I just logged in with that very username. Now I'd like to just completely get rid of my account from this app, but I can't log in to do so, and my password is breached. HELP",0
Widgets dont work most of the time :(,0
Bought the Premium version and can't re install it again without asking me to re-buy it.,0
"Bummed. I downloaded and excitedly upgraded to premium. However, my habits show up as a broken image link, so I can't actually see which habits I'm updating or tracking. Heck, I can't even edit them. I updated my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and the problem persists. Any ideas?",0
"It felt well build and easy to use, the tracking system could be better, since it has a yes or no day (maybe something in the middle sometimes things happen) the others are measure number you can introduce. The only part I did not liked, was that the website said it was free and i just let you use 5 habits then you have to pay 10,00‚Ç¨/monthly !!! It feels like a scam if it says it is for free and then in is not.",0
"It's still shows Habit Bull for me. I had put reminders and now they don't work at all. Uninstalled and downloaded again, still doesn't work. It doesn't do the minimal work it's required to do.....",0
Notifications don't work making it difficult to track habits because I don't have the habit of tracking habits. It's a vicious cycle.,0
"hello, your app is wonderful and i will buy it if i can organize my habits according to the topic, like Health, Study, etc. Thank you! Edit:I have removed since then two stars since I experience a problem with the app and I haven't received any answer from the dev, even though I sent them an email. It's about the picture not being displayed at all in the app, and it looks less beautiful like that.",0
reminder dies not work,0
Appears no longer supported by developer,0
"Good app, but lousy customer service. I emailed the developer 3 times about my problem syncing on iOS but no replies given at all. Paid for lifetime account but starting from zero there. If you see this (customer service) this 2 stars is your fault.",0
Sync doesn't happen automatically,0
"The whole app needs a new design, doesn't look good to be honest.",0
The app is okay. However some premium functions don't work. The mails I sent about this are not answered.,0
Used to work great. Couldn't export my data and support never answered my email so ending up changing to a different app.,0
Easy to use. But free version tracks only 5 habits so that makes it unusable to me.,0
"Although i like using this app, everytime i click on the Sign Up option, the app crashes and closes. I know one of these days the app is going to malfunction and I'm going to lose all my data. Please help me with this. My device is Samsung Galaxy M2",0
Why this  require this much personal details?,0
"Devs intentionally prevented you from manually setting your timezone even though that is a super basic feature. If you setup your account using a privacy browser without knowing this and want to continue using said browser, the daily rollovers will be badly uncoordinated with your actual time. I saw on github the devs pretentiously dismiss the idea of letting users manually set it due to them (not) knowing what is best for you the user. Incredibly annoying first impression so have my thanks!",0
I paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly. Come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does. But the paid version does color code. Gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two. I feel robbed.,0
I used this app once. It was not the best but quite normal. I installed it again now. The interface is absolutely unintuitive and inconvenient. It is impossible to use the app.,0
After downloading I can't login with Google. It keeps saying please wait and won't login. Great job todoist team üëèüëèüëè,0
Notification does not work,0
Garbage,0
Worked for 10 minutes until the screen went black and the app stopped working.,0
"I've not figured this app out. I don't understand how it works. I just wish I could enter in somewhere a list of goals that I want to obtain and a list of things I need to do then just have them shown in a schedule for the week so I could go over them and approve it and then move on. Maybe a bit more complex than that, but definitely simpler than what is in this app. I have yet to be able to schedule anything! I even paid the extra $5 for premium to see if that would help. but no.",0
"This used to be my favorite todo app but it was butchered to death with one pointless feature or redesign after another, making it totally unreliable as a tool for high productivity people.",0
"Logs me out randomly, and password input doesn't work with my password manager. Pretty useless when you want to jot down a quick to do item.",0
"I can understand supporting the development of the app with paywalled features, but basic features like time based reminders behind a paywall is renders the app useless even for trial.",0
Ungood,0
You guys put reminders behind a pay wall. I can get more value out of a spread sheet. The visual changes make the app more difficult to navigate. I definitely liked the old Todoist from a couple years ago much better than what it's become. This app has changed for the worst.,0
Literally wont open once even after attempting to install older versions,0
I didn't install you to pay money. So it is one of the worst apps begging for money.,0
"Now the sync does not work properly anymore. I create tasks and make changes on mobile and they don't show up. I complete a task on web, and mobile still shows the task, but when I add a comment on mobile it is lost. Same goes for adding a label to a task.",0
You really wanna me to pay in order to get reminders ? The basic functionality of any todo lists ?,0
Has no anonymous mode,0
I don't recommend using this app. You have to buy the premium version even to get mobile notificationsüôÇ. Its so infuriating as that's the bare minimum feature in lot of other free TODO apps available. Disappointed.,0
Simply too expensive considering the plethora of alternatives.,0
Paid subscriber. Latest update has broken the app for my device (Google Pixel 7 Pro) Will keep the review as a 1 star until fixed.. unacceptable for a large software company.,0
"Latest update has made the app completely useless. Can't open the app, can't refresh the widget, can't access any of my lists. Tried restarting my phone, force stopping the app, reinstalling the app, nothing has worked. Until this, I was a big fan of this app. Everything was very intuitive and easy to create collaborative lists for shared tasks. Having a widget was very convenient as well. Very sad to have to find a new alternative since this no longer works.",0
"After the Android 14 upgrade on my Pixel 6 the app just doesn't open and crashes when opened, totally unusable.",0
Lack of optimisation on lanscape devices. I can't use my fantastic keyboard on Planet Computers Cosmo Communicator because there is very little screen left while using in landscape.,0
I don't like these at all,0
Worst app asks for money to remind me of my remainder instantly ininstalled the app well done,0
this app sent me NINE emails after i made an account to try it out. unsubscribing was a pain too. the amount of trouble this app created for me for just trying it out is unbelievable.,0
Dont email me just because i log in,0
"Used to be the best GTD app, but now it slowly transforms into corporate Frankenstein monster where new features useless for individual users keep adding up.",0
"The Todoist app is suddenly claiming that I don't have ""Pro"", but that's not true! I have had ""Pro"" for years. I just triple checked my Google Play Subscriptions page, and it shows that I have an active subscription of Todoist Pro! Please fix ASAP!",0
I had installed the application in my phone. However I was not able to login in through the gmail option. So I again uninstalled and reinstalled it. Still I am facing the issue. Could you help me to resolve this. I already have my data in there. Thanks.,0
No event notifications on the free version makes it unusable.,0
"I got Todoist as I was hoping I would be able to get reminders and mark task completion on my Galaxy Watch 4. Unfortunately it did not work and I only received notifications on phone (I did checked battery omtimization settings on watch). As Todoist has no free trial, I had to purchase a monthly subscription just to try it out. It is non-refundable, a complete waste of money.",0
"Im not being able to login with Google. Already tried reinstalling the app, but it didn't work. It shows a Please wait message too fast.",0
I have had this app for a very long time and they decided to change the way it looks so the notes that I had saved here was discarded because of that. I find this very disappointing. Of course they are going to apologize but my notes will still be gone,0
Latest version ccrashing on startup,0
"Just downloaded the app because I wanted to have a checkbox for a daily task that I do (and perhaps add more going forwards). But that was not an option and I had to Google my way to it, because the app I packed with pseudo-smart features, distracting suggestions (such as answering quizzes och look through some inspiration) etc. injected directly into your daily schedule. It's way too bloated with functions that I believe no one really asked for, which drowns its most basic functions.",0
If only apps would stop begging for public reviews.,0
"Latest version keeps crashing on startup, widget stopped working as well",0
"Since the last update (Jan 25th), the ap keeps crashing. I'm glad I didn't spend my weekend adding my work backlog in. I'd be in tears today, and now I am angry because my to-do list is inaccessible from my phone.",0
"Currently app cannot start and crashes consistently, the widget also cannot be placed",0
Can't login with my Google account on my tablet,0
Can't sort tasks currently unable to pick and move within list,0
Didn't find much useful,0
"""Todoist is beautifully designed, simple to get started and intuitive to use"" Err, am I using the same app? I sign in using Google and the phone app has a large refresh icon in the middle of the screen that does absolutely nothing. Top right says ""open on smartwatch"" so I do that. On the watch I try and add some tasks and nothing seems to stick or they get dumped into the ether. Nothing I add stays. I reset phone and smartwatch and more of the same. Uninstalling. Utter rubbish.",0
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes.",0
"Looking at the features and lots of accolades I tried uninstalled after just a trial. Reason: In the free version notification feature is missing. If the task misses the set time, there is no notification. We will come to know only if we open the app. Insanely Ridiculous. Not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature.",0
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!",0
"Too greedy on the premium features. I'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description/comment to my task. Without this, you have a one liner for the task. There are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app. I tried this one, the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription.",0
"Subscription is to expensive for supported features. It is not easy to oversee all the things gooing on. I could not create ""subsections"" in my personal routines section to keep things stuffed. Also it is not possible to mark something as ""not done"". Especially for reoccuring routines this would make perfectly sence. Another rather bad thing is, that it is not easy to analyze progress or precission. Especially for routines a statistical analysis would be good. Also a visualization for due dates.",0
"Is setting reminders and labels really worth being a premium feature? In my opinion the app is literally useless without them. If it was a $5 one time purchase then maybe it would be fair, but $48 per year is ridiculous. All of the premium features are easy to emulate with apps that came with my phone. I hate how even the simple apps have to be subscription based nowadays, even for something as simple as a bloody to do list.",0
"Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra.",0
"Used to be the best GTD app, but now it slowly transforms into corporate Frankenstein monster where new features useless for individual users keep adding up.",0
"I am colour blind and dyslexic. Not able to read anything. I can't zoom in and I need to pay in order to see the colours better. [update] As I said, I would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so I can actually read and make use with it. I've tried WeNote, and it's the app I need, without having to pay premium.",0
"Subscription based. ¬£50 a year. For a todo list app. No. Imagine you put 10 or 20 similarly priced apps on your phone, you're losing ¬£500 to ¬£1000 per year, the price of a flagship phone! Every year! I'd have paid between ¬£5 and ¬£10 max for this app for the pro features. I'll look elsewhere, I'm not going to encourage this greed.",0
After downloading I can't login with Google. It keeps saying please wait and won't login. Great job todoist team üëèüëèüëè,0
I have subscribed the pro version as I needed the reminders. Had wrote to the support and it's been days and I have yet to hear anything from them. Updates: finally they replied me. However still waiting for updates.,0
"My theme keep reverting to the default them and the icon is not updated when changed and when updated, it keep reverting back too. Still waiting for in-place completed tasks.",0
Horrible experince. Glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface. Waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes. On top of that the most important features are paid. But wait... its a subscription to pay ¬£4 monthly!! For a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments. Cannot recommend to anyone.,0
"The popups you've started to do when X amount of tasks are completed just get in the way. Especially on the app, it takes up most of the screen and has to be navigated away from. It may work in some scenarios but not all, give me an option to turn it off please. I don't want to be congratulated for achieving my 5th task of the day, especially when all I've done is tick off ""bananas"" from a shopping list, I just want to see what's next.",0
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",0
"At first it looks good, nice UI, great UX. But when you start syncing between devices...everything falls apart. (It is not individual problem, check other 1-2* reviews.) Adding tasks on one device works no more: after adding, it disappears in a second. On the other device it appears somehow but also starts multiplying at the same time. Totally confusing and unreliable. Since it is a core feature for multi device usage, now it is unusable at all. Please revise the sync feature, it could be 5*.",0
"Widgets are the reason I installed this app. Now the widgets aren't clickable anymore. Apart from this, there is no undo if you accidentally select a task. At this point I feel like I should make my own app",0
"Lazy tech support. Just can't be bothered. Took down my initial adverse review to give tech support a chance to sort things out. They just couldn't be bothered. I'm using Nine email and having a problem sharing with Todoist when I want to create a task using an email. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn't. However sharing with Wunderlist works every time! Todoist tech support answer: sort it out yourself with Nine! UPDATE. After numerous emails to tech support they still haven't bothered.",0

"Here is the promised review. Hello developer. This very day, I subscribed to this app in order to receive notifications about to do items. I received an email reminder but was lead to believe I would receive notifications, which I did not. Owing to this, I have cancelled my subscription this same day. I am disgusted, and I suggest that other users of this app refrain from making a subscription, instead utilising the free option. That is ¬£48 I will not see again.",0

Exceptionally frustrated right now I'm unable to add any task. The orange send button will light up but clicking does nothing.,0
Horrible app that is continuously loading for 5 mins without showing up the task list. Uninstall & reinstall it to solve the issue temporarily & the issue reappeared again after closing the app. The app didn't have as many technical issues in the past as compared with the recent 1-2 years. Not sure why recently they are lots of tech issue with the app.,0

This app was complicated for beginners,0
Doesn't even let me create an account or log into my previously made account. It works just fine on my computer tho. I don't like it that much bc it's not a one time purchase but a yearly subscription. Prob will delete later today,0
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,0

I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks.",0
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",0
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",0
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",0
"App generally works, but it's impossible to include any time or date information in a task name, which is incredibly frustrating. For example, if you want a task that says 'tell family I need the car tomorrow', you're out of luck because 'tomorrow' is not allowed. You can't 'prepare for meeting at 12' either, or any such thing. Very annoying system.",0
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.,0
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.",0
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....",0
"Despite an intuitive interface, and positive initial impression, I was unable to get recurring events to show up properly on my ""upcoming"" calendar. Frustrating to schedule a routine item for ""every weekday at 7am"", see it reflected correctly in the task view, then look at your ""upcoming"" tab to have it only show it on the next day. I could not find any cases of others having this issue online, so maybe I'm just a moron. And morons leave 2-star reviews for things that are their own fault.",0
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",0
"had this app for about a year. it was perfect for what i needed it for at first, but now it's practically unuseable. sections and tasks randomly duplicate and can't be deleted without also deleting unrelated items. i tried updating my app, which didn't help at all. sad to see it go, but i use my calendar every day, and the frustration of dealing with these glitches is simply not worth it!",0
"It looks nice, but a couple issues making it not great for repeated tasks. 1. When a task is overdue (either missed or forgot to check off), there's no way to check off that iteration or mark as missed, checking off the overdue one checks off the next iteration. 2. The widget has no way to apply both ""Today"" and a project filter. 3. No way to change what to consider start of day to be. A lot of my tasks personally I do around midnight, so it's impossible to setup for that.",0
"The repeat option is nonexist. The only time its allowed me to repeat a task is ""every month"". At first I thought ""every two weeks"" might be too confusing for it but I tried ""every week"" and ""every day"" and it doesn't pop up except for that first day. Also the fact that it often lists the scheduled date as ""today"" despite me not yet picking a date is stupid, and it resets to ""today"" automatically when I try to edit the task in any way (like change the name). It doesn't make any sense!",0
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",0
"I used this app for years and loved it. But recently they seem to have removed a feature that has eliminated a great deal of its function: the ability to set customized recurring reminders. This is a huge problem and has made it only half-usable. After years of being in the top percent of their users (something they also got rid of, their annual tracking), I am going to have to find a new app. It's a real shame, because I've been a premium user for so long and always really liked Todoist.",0
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!",0
"It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update. The checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete. This is a bad, bad deal. I use Todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses. If I errantly check off a task, it could cost me a lot of money, and possibly lose me a client. Hopefully you'll fix this right away.",0
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",0
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.",0
"On limited trial, it was not intuitive to use and the paid version is required to set a reminder. The app should just be a paid app only then. What's the use of this app without the ability to set a simple reminder? With so many task list apps out there, I've been going through trying them out and this one was a quick uninstall.",0
"Usually this is a great tool. The widget is very well designed and helps me stay organized. Unfortunately, the software has been crashing since the most recent update. This makes rearranging and organizing my day very difficult. I use a Motorola, so it may just be an issue with my type of phone.",0
"Confusing and difficult to use, plus some very basic features require payment.",0
"I wish Tasks with far due dates or task with non still shows up in ""Today"" I often forget what the task is because of it, If there's a way to do it please tell me, Thank You!",0
"""how many tasks do I have today"" is gone?? I've read your blog, but couldn't find that it answers why I can't see anywhere the number of tasks I have, which seems like the most basic thing. My feedback is simple: I need to know how many tasks I have, and your new design is a strict regression in that sense. Put it in the ""today"" icon? I don't need to know the ""day of the month"", for instance.",0
"Design and updates rule #1: don't fix if it works well! They completely changed the design, it's 100% inconvenient and uncomfortable now. + it's more iOS design logic which is absolutely not ok for android. Can't use it now. P.S.: still can't pay for the premium from Russia, THANKS FOR THE DESCRIMINATION LOVE IT SO MUCH",0
"Why did you change the font color from white to red in the dark theme of the widget? It was so much better in white. Please change it back, or at least put an option to choose font color",0
Devs pls give us an option to set custom font (ttf file) for the widget and add shadow to the widget font. The current widget lacks basic customisability which makes it look very clunky in custom launcher setups. PLEASE add these options. üôèüèΩ,0
"Cannot even have a decent task management app! With every update, tasks are randomly duplicated and deleted. And I am on the paid plan so this makes it even more painful",0
"I used to love love love this app. I have it both on mobile and PC. BUT....recently it became a nuisance to use it on mobile. When I enter a task, and then proceed to insert another one, the second task contains the first task auto populated!!! So I need to delete the prepopulated words from my first task, and continue writing my second task. Do you guys test your apps before running an update!?! I'm sorry that after years of using this, I'm moving to another app.",0
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.",0
"OK but not as good as it once was. I have now switched to Google tasks, considerably more stable, greater functionality and zero cost.",0
It's fine for a simple to-do list No longer links with their Alexa skill via Google. This means you can't add to your to-do list by voice commands.,0
"Was great, a bit slow on the sync every now and then, which made us end up with more toast then needed. However, they crippled the app to a point that I is simply not usable anymore",0
It might be good. It wasn't what I needed. Deleted the app. Still getting emails. Have to reinstall the app to turn off the notifications or delete your account. Reinstalled. Tried to delete account. Now I need to set up a password because I signed in with Google. Go to account settings to set password. I go to account settings. Can I see anywhere to set a password? Nope. FML.,0
"1. I wish this had better localisation. Colour instead of color. 2. When you delete a project it still shows in the projects list until you trigger a reload of the page by reopening the app. 3. Everything is very menu focused, I wish I could move a task into a different priority group but instead I have to click on it then change the priority.",0
"I liked the app and have been using it for months now. I decided to upgrade to premium because I needed the reminder feature. Unfortunately, the one feature I upgraded for isn't working. I created several test tasks to check what the problem is to no avail. Battery optimisation disabled, app reinstalled, notifications enabled. The reminder only comes through if I have the app open. What's the point? Glad I only subscribed for a month. I loved the app experience but sadly I'll have to switch.",0
"There's now an option to set a time when scheduling tasks, which I thought was great. Unfortunately the app also scheduled a duration by default, even though that's a feature for paying users only. As an unpaid subscriber, I couldn't adjust or remove task durations that have been automatically applied. I had to subscribe in order to access the button to turn them off. Very irritating, but I suppose it forces people to subscribe which might be the point.",0
"I've been using the Pro version for a number of years. I was never very happy with the subscription based model but the app was useful. Now I am told that the Pro subscription will renew at $48/year instead of the $29/year that I have been paying. For me, that large of a price increase just priced me out of their app.",0
The app is not intuitive. Subtask feature is great. Very hard to edit a task once entered. It is easier to just delete the task and re-enter it than waste the time searching for the place to edit the task. It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to move a task from the inbox to the project it needed to be in.,0
"Please stop loading screen from scratch each time I switch tabs from nav bar. It looks especially bad when switching from ""Inbox"" tab to ""Today"" tab and back. Preserve screen from destroying when you switch tabs. It wasn't noticeable in the previous design but now it is and it looks just terrible. Look at the same IOS navbar behaviour. You don't see tasks being loaded from scratch each time you change a tab on IOS. You can provide the same behaviour on Android.",0
"You have to purchase a payment plan just to get reminders, this is yet another unprofessional made app that you should not get and it is not worth any of your time. Their is not too many features to this app and just like every other app it is not worth getting. I will be uninstalling and spiting whoever made this for eternity.",0
"Todoist has some useful features, one of the most useful is task reminders (although this is only fully available in ""pro""). However, a simple feature would be to check off tasks completed yesterday, but every day, daily tasks reset at midnight and there is no going back. Simple feature, I know other apps that have it, and I've seen comments online of people begging for this feature for years. So the most useful thing I get out of the app is paid for, and the rest leaves much to be desired. üôÉ",0
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.,0
I'm finding it too complex for an app that just help me do basic stuff like ticking groceries and daily activities. Is it just me? User Experience here is heading to zero and it is almost turning into a project management tool like trello. Too complex.,0
"It was a great app that stopped working properly. The sync was not working for mobile app and desktop, I have reinstalled the app (losing all the updates I have made on mobile), and 1 week later - it is not working again!",0
Sends unsolicited emails without asking permission.,0
"Widgets are the reason I installed this app. Now the widgets aren't clickable anymore. Apart from this, there is no undo if you accidentally select a task. At this point I feel like I should make my own app",0
"The problem is still there. Bring back the colorless header widget please, the new one with red text header is awful. I want back the dark widget with white text, not red.",0

"My theme keep reverting to the default them and the icon is not updated when changed and when updated, it keep reverting back too. Still waiting for in-place completed tasks.",0
By reading the reviews I installed and then suddenly uninstall my self,0
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",0
"Why do developers keep changing things for the worse? I have been a paid pro user for close to a decade, and today the title bar popped back up onto my widget, which has not had one for as long as I can remember. So, I go to the settings to remove it (as I have in the past) and the setting is gone. Last week, the app stopped allowing me to say ""P1"", ""P2"", etc. for setting the priority on my to-do list items via voice-to-text as I have always done. So frustrating! Time to find a new to-do list...",0
"As a Pro member, I subscribed because I appreciated that this app paid a lot of attention to design. However it's been 2 years since I filed a ticket to dynamic update the widget theme and the widget still doesn't dynamically change to dark mode when system dark mode is enabled or disabled. I've already added a support ticket and everything but this one change to simply change the color prevents me from adding it to my homescreen. Google's Task widget does this, why can't Todoist?",0

New subtasks refuse to stay put and I just lost a whole task with a bunch of subtasks that was an important thing I was working on üò° Just disappeared after I rescheduled unrelated tasks. I am also not a huge fan of the visual changes, but one can learn to deal with that. Been using the app for years, and this is quite a mess.",0
Very annoying app. Frequently pops annoying notices about made-up goals and badges while I'm trying to get actual work done. I'm not joking. I was trying to get things done and it pops up an award or badge for getting 5 things done and then tells me that it was 5 more than yesterday. In what world do I care about their stupid goals for me??? I have to waste my time reading the messages in case they are actually important.,0
Setting Reminder is paid feature for any to-do app..... LOL...... Only this is sufficient enough to rate 1 star and remove app from phone.,0
Gross subscription model and unusable without it.,0
"STAY WELL AWAY if you want a reliable and safe system! I'm a Pro user for many years, more than 23 thousand completed tasks. The developers keep re-introducing bugs to the core system tgag had been fixed before They clearly do not automate testing. I constantly supply support tickets for bugs. Getting tired of being a paying beta tester. It used to be good but has gone down hill fast!",0
"Just tried to use it. It showed some buttons during set up, including how to use Todoist. Turned it on, clicked on the sentence, finally continued on. I searched around, but never found help using the app. This might be a great app for people that know how to use it or are seasoned enough in apps to figure it out, but wherever the guidance is for those that don't know, it's buried too deeply to be any help. I was unable to do anything useful and, instead, a big waste of a chunk of my morning!",0
"I purchased the pro subscription, but the reminder notifications can't be sent to my watch. This rendered the app useless for my purposes.",0
üëé,0
another terrible update on the widget. it's on your screen all the time changing it is not a good move. im just getting rid of it at this point.,0
I have subscribed the pro version as I needed the reminders. Had wrote to the support and it's been days and I have yet to hear anything from them. Updates: finally they replied me. However still waiting for updates.,0
"Update ruined it It was great before , it's one of those apps you use but forget exist because it's just so good at what it does ( like the clock app) . But the most recent update has made it glichy and unusable. Every interaction I make with the app , may it be adding a task or postponing it , it makes the app get stuck in a refreshing loop till you close it. I'm keeping the app on my phone because I genuinely just love the app ,my issue is with the bug I'm experiencing.",0
"New interface 1 star for # signs instead of the clean easy to read circles. ü§¨ Previous 5 Star review: I'm an Enlightepaid todoist user for years. It is my favorite note app but I also store other information I can share lists with others. The free app is also great & I can share with free users. Besides shopping lists, I use todoist to keep household I formation such as air filter sizes, paint colors, dimensions, etc. It syncs across all devices.",0
amazing app but the only thing i needed was the reminders which is only available if you upgrade to pro unfortunately.,0
"Worst app, doesn't even show the notification about the todo list. Have to upgrade to their pro feature to set reminders."" Google Calendar and Google tasks"" is far better than this useless app.",0
"Latest version keeps crashing on startup, widget stopped working as well",0
"Redesigned dialogs are broken: 1) ""Import day from"" dialog on routine edit screen ‚Äì no ""Monday"" & ""Tuesday"" in the day list (spinner) 2) ""+ Notification"" dialog on routine edit screen ‚Äì no ""Play voice"" checkbox (Please tell me if there's a better way to report bugs like this)",0
"Great app but the notification ringtone doesn't work, which is really important for me. Hope you add a calendar feature for the week at least.",0
"Great at first but now it's getting on my nerves. I tried to create a routine for each day of the week. Today is Monday, and for some reason, my Monday routine shows up for tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well. There seems to be a setting where I can change this, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. It shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week. Uninstalled.",0
You really should not make the sync ability a premium functionality since there is no one who is willing to set each of their calendars one by one again just for try a new schedule app.,0
App is quite good but the Problem is that even if I select the play sound option it only shows a window popup the play sound option doesn't work for my device and without it I am unable to figure out what to do,0
"I've spent hours on it already and I'm just not getting it. Looks like most tutorials are for an older version. Can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day Routines, what's the difference between a Routine and an Event, etc.",0
"Two star just because of not adding the Task add option or project as other. The developer should alter this app. Look at the apps such as Timenoder, todos and planner apps",0
"My phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what I do. It keep showing it was blocked, troubleshoot, and refresh background task.",0
"really messy if it comes to choosing days. instead of day 1 day 2... it should use monday, tuesday edit: i had a new version and the problem with the naming is that it makes it confusing so I ended up trying several options to get the temple start at the right day",0
I rate it 2 Star because it's been four days now I am using this app first 2 days it always notify me perfectly but today it didn't notify me at all I restart my phone check the setting I check everything but still it's not notify me at all please update the app or it's just became useless and I have to uninstall it but still I wait this month for the update,0
"App is really good..! But, after giving all possible permissions for the app to run in background also, I'm not getting any notifications..!",0
"Way too many taps required to add an entry, in my opinion. Streamline the process...",0
"Fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore, it's just blank. I've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank.",0
The app is always blocked by the system even I allow all the permission of this app. I cant hear or see any notifications even I fixed all the settings both of the app and my phone,0
"I used to use it, but found a better app that allowed me to properly use my back up, so I took a break. Then, after I came back to see if the bug was fixed, but now a new bug of not working properly even though it's been paid for.",0
"Limited unless you buy the full version. I spent time looking around trying to work with the app. A lot of things I tried wanted me to upgrade, which is why I found another.... I feel my review is fair. Sorry.",0
"Well, The app interface itself is quite confusing. The interface should be more simple & easy to understand.",0
"The minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me. I had hoped to use this as an exercise timer (I need alternating time countdowns running consecutively e.g. 3m/30s, 3m/1m, 5m/1m) plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on TV. I'll keep looking.",0
Nothing special. just a calendar app. not worth the time it takes to set up. clunky at best. poor layout. minimal instructions. not intuitive to use,0
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars",0
App cannot keep track of an atypical. Everytime I set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one. instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work. I'm deleting this app for sure.,0
"It is a good idea, but it's not really easy to use.. in fact it's quite complicated :/ I bought premium because they advertised I could set schedules per day, and I can, but not how I had hoped. I recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor, and additionally make any small changes in each individual day.",0
Not great I have this for almost a year. It is great for arrangement but functionality sucks. Its alarms ring always a few minutes after the start time. Today i tried to change the ringtune but it is still playing old tune. Android kills this app sometimes and it doesnt recover. It doesnt auto start for me when you restart you phone or close open apps. Going to look for better app now.,0
"I've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential. It has a simple UI but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work. I purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work. But I can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles (if it's even possible), starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends",0
"My goodness the latest update is the worst experience. I've used this app since 2019 and it used to be great. Now? Overlapping scedules, more than 24 hours in a day (why are u guys using day 1,2,3 anyways such a hassle). I prefer back then when u used to organize the routines by days in the week rather day 1,2,3. It is really difficult to organise and sync. And don't you tell me to send email to customer help cause I did. But the response was meh. Bye TT. I guess our long relationship has to end",0
"Very nice app but 1 important functionality is missing...There is no option to mark the task as completed. If task is not completed, then there is should be a option to reschedule it to another day or let it expire. Further its agreed that it is not a to do app, but if something doesn't go as per plan, we should be aware that the particular task is not yet completed and depending upon it we may decide to reschedule it or let it expire",0
EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless.. I understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone (as I've seen in other reviews).,0
"it is unstable with time in my Android phone , i.e it doesn't goes with time to time in order you should enter to the app so its become upto time",0
"I was recommended this app by a friend who loves it. I got the premium version as I expected it to have better features. This app is very confusing to use. I even went to the ""help"" section and was even more confused. I'm very disappointed",0
"Very bad app. I organised all of my activities, took me 1 hour to complete my planner, then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am, so all my afternoon activities where at the morning, for example if I had to eat at 1pm it said that I had to eat at 1am, so I changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule. WASTING 1 HOUR",0
"Wasn't sure to begin with, as it's not all that user friendly... but how frustrating to take a chance anyway & pay for premium only to have it NOT sync with my Calendars....! Wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that.... What a small waste of money; it's of no use to me now! üòí",0
"This app was DEFINITELY better before the update. The ""add time to previous activity"" feature was great! But it's not in the app anymore. And another good feature is gone too! Seriously would've given this a five star rating if the update didn't take place. I have been using this for year's now. Very disappointed with the new update.",0
"App is good but the programmer feature is bad. I have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days. So if I have late meetings on Wed and Fri, I want to enable a separate set of routines for these days. Similarly for weekends. The programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that I bought the pro version for. I want small, reusable routines that I can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates.",0
Almost perfect...but one huge flaw. Can't sync between multiple devices. I need something that I can use on my phone for notification but on my tablet or computer for planning.,0
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?",0
So far I am confused. I downloaded after all the reviews seemed high. I entered an event and had to do so twice and it still is not showing. Where is there a tutorial on how to add events and the like? The only thing I could do is to change the event icon and color or add one. I AM SO LOST.,0
"It was a really good app for keeping a log of everything you had done throughout the day, until I realized you could literally do nothing with the data. There are no export or report generating features of any kind.",0
"Android keep blocking the app from sending notifications, I've re-downloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens ! FIX IT.",0
"There one problem I have with the app though I love every other thing about and it is that once I spend sometime outside the app it doesn't notify me about schedules until I open it again. I've allowed the app every permission it's asked, but it's still the same.",0
"I would love this app only if the notifications work at all. There were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my Oppo F5. I tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times, yet nothing worked. Would give 5 if I do not have this issue.",0
"Clunky, complicated, and confusing. Not streamlined. Ugly color choice for non pro. Just a disappointment.",0
Its great and all but I bought the pro version n got my receipt but I'm still stuck with the normal version. I've tried reinstalling but nothing works. Please reply this and tell me how I can get pro version. I hav proof of my payment too,0
Would agree that it isnt very user friendly. Functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time,0
Reminders should not be transfered in event section. It was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly.,0
"You must plan in resuming the reminder tab. It's really important. By the way, I'm a paid user.",0
App shows start time in notification but does not show in end time. Please app improve.,0
It is good app but is not tuning/alarming even i setted notifications option in blogs tell me how can i correct this issue,0
I really need the what you can say really annoying sound when the block is finished,0
This is a very bad app I wrote it perfectly the first day all the other days time laps time laps time laps WHY I CAN'T GO TO 7 YEARS JUST TO FIX TIME LAPS,0
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.,0
This tune can make alarm? I set a few alarm is not ringing..,0
Annoying to set up. You'd think it would be easy to have the exact same same schedule just 30 min later.,0
How to use this app? ü§î Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.,0
"im sure the app is nice, but i cannot add a routine, or any activity, nor i can delete anything?",0
"It is better if don't have Buy pro version, hoping an app free offline soon .",0
Edit: They turned off my schedule so they could tell me the new update has more ads now.,0
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund,0
osm app but now its update an I am not able to see my all reminders that I use to remind my self before uninstalling the app,0
calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature,0
statistical data for daily routine and check marks for completed or missed routines are expected,0
"Notification not working, useless just throwing background issue error",0
It's all great until schedule blocks start deleting themselves randomly :(,0
"This needs trial period! I'm currently looking for an app that allows me to plan my day to the minute, that gives notifications when i want, and that is easy and intuitive to use. At first glance this app seems to provide me with everything i want.. However all those features seem to be locked behind a paywall. Now i am fully willing to pay for an app that does what i want it to, but i do want to be assured of that. In other words, it needs to feature a trial period for the premium version.",0
"I was trying out the routine trick. I set the times and dates, but it just wouldn't work. Please help.",0
I like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring ......in the system I allowed everything I needed too but still it's not working out,0
"Unfortunately, the notifications does not work I did all you mentioned and still the problem exists, The bell thingy on blocks is desipeared.",0
Very difficult to get fimilier with user interface.. second there should some template to edit .. starting from all over making daily routine is a bit hactic to do ..,0
"I can't edit the alarm so that it doesnt repeat, gets really really annoying as I have to stop the timer interrupting my work",0
i had added a routine & by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date... i m unable to change the date... it's frustrating...,0
"Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive.",0
Has a lot of potential but lacking really simple features like being able to drag a block within schedule (as you can in template),0
Latest update causing the app crash consistently. Reinstalled a number of time but no change. Sad.,0
"I find a better called structured app and prosper.Kindly improve your or perish.Im not rude, but I am informing you how time blocking apps should work.Kindly give the users a better app experience.I would like to give my humble opnion before deleting your app.",0
Really weird formatting? I'm trying to be MORE organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app,0
I wish they would bring drag-and-drop back. Using the up-down arrows to rearrange items is a pain.,0
"Very good app, but it would be perfect if the app actually didn't shut down and not give me notifications. PLEASE FIX THIS",0
"Please update the app, i want to use the app, but After a day ,alarm is not ringing , i think this app have too much bugs and problems",0
Why is break tag forcefully added in all activities? Why can't I remove it? Why deleting tags delete the whole activity? Edit - I don't think you quite understood the problem. I cannot change or remove the 'break' tag. Even in work activities it forces the break tag and I cannot replace it. Plus if an activity has 3 tags and one of them gets removed doesn't mean you'll remove the whole activity.,0
"This app is really very good, but notifications aren't working. I tried everything it told me to do but it's still not working.",0
I uninstalled the app after the new update. It was confusing and I couldn't set my routines properly.,0
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.,0
"I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press ""silence notifications,"" you can never turn them back on.",0
I'm not being rude but it was really hard to use it had no step by step guide and I had to learn myself it was really hard creating a day schelde,0
useless I dont want to purchase the app as this free version offers no good features.. the paid app might be better..Rating 2 just because of the feedback on user review.,0
"It's been nearly a year since I downloaded this app, and it's still clunky and hard to use. Blocks still don't have the option to appear on the calendar. You still can't organise the blocks by different orders, eg. 'Sort by date descending/ascending' I have to scroll through months of blocks to get to the most recent. There's still no 'home screen' to see all commitments. I thought I'd downloaded in early stages and it was just going to get better, but it seems this app is stagnant.",0
"I dream this will become my favorite app in the future, but right now, it's more toilsome even than just using pen and paper. All start and end times must be entered manually. There's no drag and drop, no moving blocks around, no changing their lenght, no duplicating them easily, no default block lenghts, no autoschedule. If you have to make just one little change to your plan, it's easier to just scrap the whole day and start anew.",0
"Has potential and seems reasonably thought out in terms of intuitiveness for the user. However, it bugged horribly at me in the most basic thing you could ask of it: assigning a template to multiple days. Specifically, it doubled all of the tasks in all of the days assigned the template and removed the task titles. That pretty much made the app useless to me.",0
"The app can't do what it's supposed to do. I have multiple projects and this should be the right app for it. However, when I have shared projects the people I share them with don't see the projects. If this could be resolved I would change my rating.",0
"I had given this app a 5 star before, but this new update has ruined the experience for me. The most important thing is my tasks are literally disappearing! New subtasks refuse to stay put and I just lost a whole task with a bunch of subtasks that was an important thing I was working on üò° Just disappeared after I rescheduled unrelated tasks. I am also not a huge fan of the visual changes, but one can learn to deal with that. Been using the app for years, and this is quite a mess.",0
"Now the sync does not work properly anymore. I create tasks and make changes on mobile and they don't show up. I complete a task on web, and mobile still shows the task, but when I add a comment on mobile it is lost. Same goes for adding a label to a task.",0
"Not modern enough. year 2024 and yet todoist developers can't figure out how to sync widget theme with device dark theme. what a lazy approach for basic interface reference design requirements. some developers do need Google start punishing for lack of care the same Apple does. Apps not compliant with basic guidelines shall be taken off the store. I have been paid user for years. Yet the app feels even more cheap now wirh such a lack of touch. and yes, Microsoft ToDo is a free alternative now",0
"I've not figured this app out. I don't understand how it works. I just wish I could enter in somewhere a list of goals that I want to obtain and a list of things I need to do then just have them shown in a schedule for the week so I could go over them and approve it and then move on. Maybe a bit more complex than that, but definitely simpler than what is in this app. I have yet to be able to schedule anything! I even paid the extra $5 for premium to see if that would help. but no.",0
You guys put reminders behind a pay wall. I can get more value out of a spread sheet. The visual changes make the app more difficult to navigate. I definitely liked the old Todoist from a couple years ago much better than what it's become. This app has changed for the worst.,0
"Been a user for years now. Usually love it. But all of sudden when I try to make a task while I'm looking at a certain day in the future, anything I add will be sent straight to ""Today"" entry. I have to manually tell it to be on a certain day now, even though I'm looking at that day currently in the app...... And yeah that's just too inconvenient for me. I'll see if it gets fixed, if not, time to go back to free version.",0
"I got Todoist as I was hoping I would be able to get reminders and mark task completion on my Galaxy Watch 4. Unfortunately it did not work and I only received notifications on phone (I did checked battery omtimization settings on watch). As Todoist has no free trial, I had to purchase a monthly subscription just to try it out. It is non-refundable, a complete waste of money.",0
"Update ruined it It was great before , it's one of those apps you use but forget exist because it's just so good at what it does ( like the clock app) . But the most recent update has made it glichy and unusable. Every interaction I make with the app , may it be adding a task or postponing it , it makes the app get stuck in a refreshing loop till you close it. I'm keeping the app on my phone because I genuinely just love the app ,my issue is with the bug I'm experiencing.",0
"""Todoist is beautifully designed, simple to get started and intuitive to use"" Err, am I using the same app? I sign in using Google and the phone app has a large refresh icon in the middle of the screen that does absolutely nothing. Top right says ""open on smartwatch"" so I do that. On the watch I try and add some tasks and nothing seems to stick or they get dumped into the ether. Nothing I add stays. I reset phone and smartwatch and more of the same. Uninstalling. Utter rubbish.",0
"Was pleasantly surprised with nice UI and ability to add and organize tasks. Got everything moved over from G Tasks and set to use Todoist. That was until I was waiting for a reminder to notify me a task is due. A notification of a task due is an integral part of task management. Unfortunately you must purchase the premium version for this to work, which in my opinion makes this app completely unusable.",0
"I'm pretty sure I have two accounts, one through apple and one through google play. i tried to follow the instructions to deactivate one and I'm missing the button that's described in the how-to. I've reached out for help with no avail. I'll probably cancel both accounts. Two starts for lousy customer support on a decent product. UPDATE TO ONE STAR FOR NO REFUND UPON CANCELING.",0
"Huge pain to delete. I immediately realized I would not use this app, and tried to delete. It took forever to find out how, and then I was told I needed to set a new password to delete everything. I did that, and then it gave me a random error saying to try again later. Very frustrating for something I literally do not even want to be interacting with anymore!!",0
"Not a good first impression. Too easy to press a wrong fuction (e.g. check boxes) thinking it initiates a section when it clears the section instead (confetti streams down and section dissapears). No way to undelete. Also, when selecting any ""help"" or ""contact"" info, screen clears and shows, ""Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).""",0
"It's been three months and the app still stops syncing periodically. It just hangs, as does the widget. The only way to recover is to delete the app's local data. And their support email address listed in the Play Store is still the same one that they don't actually support. I think it's time to finally give up :(",0
"I am extremeky disappointed with this app.  I lost a lot of information with the last upgrade.  Now, i am wasting time constantly updating this app.  I am currently looking at other applications.  If your improvements risk functionality,  it is not worth it.  It makes me believe that your designers and programmers do not actually use the app. I use the app for health issues like medicine times.  Could have been very detrimental.",0
AVOID! Constant email spam and the developers made sure deleting your account is nigh impossible. I was trying to create a password for my account on their site and it said my password may have been exposed to a security breach... my password that doesn't exist. The app keeps giving me errors when I try to set up a password... still working on it. AVOID THIS PLAUGE!,0
"DO NOT BUY the premium if you need Alexa and/or Outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from Todoist. Outlook integration has never been a synced integration, it only forwards tasks one-way & only works with limited Outlook paid platforms. They have Alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up, no warning before buying believing you can integrate both. No Support response yet. I want my money back. Such waste of hours. I feel scammed",0
"I once rated this app and company a five star. However long, with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience. All the alerts.settings are changed so you get texts, notifications and emails when you had turn them off. The suggested time zone change so their app ""will.function correctly"" breaks the assigned due date times. I like to see companies trying to improve, but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data. Lost of all trust here.",0
"If you sign up for this app, understand you will received excessive emails, without the ability to actually unsubscribe. I have tried REPEATEDLY, yet still receive emails weekly or more. I just tried again, marked no to everything, only to receive a ""tips and tricks"" email literally one minute later. I will never reconsider using this app after this bs.",0
I used this app once. It was not the best but quite normal. I installed it again now. The interface is absolutely unintuitive and inconvenient. It is impossible to use the app.,0
I don't recommend using this app. You have to buy the premium version even to get mobile notificationsüôÇ. Its so infuriating as that's the bare minimum feature in lot of other free TODO apps available. Disappointed.,0
I'm finding it too complex for an app that just help me do basic stuff like ticking groceries and daily activities. Is it just me? User Experience here is heading to zero and it is almost turning into a project management tool like trello. Too complex.,0
"After the Android 14 upgrade on my Pixel 6 the app just doesn't open and crashes when opened, totally unusable.",0
"Just downloaded the app because I wanted to have a checkbox for a daily task that I do (and perhaps add more going forwards). But that was not an option and I had to Google my way to it, because the app I packed with pseudo-smart features, distracting suggestions (such as answering quizzes och look through some inspiration) etc. injected directly into your daily schedule. It's way too bloated with functions that I believe no one really asked for, which drowns its most basic functions.",0
"As a Pro member, I subscribed because I appreciated that this app paid a lot of attention to design. However it's been 2 years since I filed a ticket to dynamic update the widget theme and the widget still doesn't dynamically change to dark mode when system dark mode is enabled or disabled. I've already added a support ticket and everything but this one change to simply change the color prevents me from adding it to my homescreen. Google's Task widget does this, why can't Todoist?",0
"Had been using it since ages now. But recently, I've been facing issues continually with the widget. The widget on home screen won't update and I've missed many tasks because of this.",0
"Critical breaking bugs (syncing) aren't addressed for months. Support takes a long time to come to a resolution. Really unhappy with how this is handled from paid software. Genuinely, without working syncing I might as well use pen and paper.",0
"It was a great app that stopped working properly. The sync was not working for mobile app and desktop, I have reinstalled the app (losing all the updates I have made on mobile), and 1 week later - it is not working again!",0
"I can understand supporting the development of the app with paywalled features, but basic features like time based reminders behind a paywall is renders the app useless even for trial.",0
"This used to be my favorite todo app but it was butchered to death with one pointless feature or redesign after another, making it totally unreliable as a tool for high productivity people.",0
"Im not being able to login with Google. Already tried reinstalling the app, but it didn't work. It shows a Please wait message too fast.",0
I am leaving todoist! Terrible horrible (no at all) customer support. There is no way to contact customer care. I want to upgrade to pro plan. But for some reason I can't. And there is NOBODY that I could ask about that. Only some stupid online forms that doesn't fit my needs. I lost more than one hour trying to upgrade pro plan.. but didn't find a way. Literally no email on any other contact. That's really poor and sad,0
"Worked well for years on my Android, but with every update there are more problems. First the widgets entered an infinite refresh loop so I had to get rid of those. Now the main app shows a black screen when opening it and nothing else. I have pro through my business subscription, but I have to look to another service now, one that works.",0
"""Unfortunately, something went wrong""... Can't setup any INTEGRATION. Todoist team, when you are developing anything please do not forget the TESTING PHASE!!! Don't send things to production without testing!!!",0
I have had this app for a very long time and they decided to change the way it looks so the notes that I had saved here was discarded because of that. I find this very disappointing. Of course they are going to apologize but my notes will still be gone,0
"The Todoist app is suddenly claiming that I don't have ""Pro"", but that's not true! I have had ""Pro"" for years. I just triple checked my Google Play Subscriptions page, and it shows that I have an active subscription of Todoist Pro! Please fix ASAP!",0
"Logs me out randomly, and password input doesn't work with my password manager. Pretty useless when you want to jot down a quick to do item.",0
Lack of optimisation on lanscape devices. I can't use my fantastic keyboard on Planet Computers Cosmo Communicator because there is very little screen left while using in landscape.,0
Limited to 5 categories unless you subscribe to premium. I would pay a one off for a decent To Do app. But they are all greedy scumbags. It garbage. Deleted.,0
"Since the last update (Jan 25th), the ap keeps crashing. I'm glad I didn't spend my weekend adding my work backlog in. I'd be in tears today, and now I am angry because my to-do list is inaccessible from my phone.",0
Worked for 10 minutes until the screen went black and the app stopped working.,0
"NOT SAFE FOR BUSINESS: Hits maximum of 20 sections per project, even if some are deleted. When hit, nothing stops you from wasting hours of work that will ultimately disappear when you close the app because it's attached to an unsaved heading. This cost me money using it as a tool for brainstorming with a client. Todoist responded to this review before responding to my ticket (#680407). It's been over 2 weeks and there's been no news. Technical & customer support nightmare. There are better apps",0
"Tried to give this app a chance several times over the years, paid for subscription. Never ended up staying with it. Latest attempt to use (Sep 2023) is also unsuccessful. Was adding tasks for an hour to find out it lost labels for one part of the tasks, duration for another part of the tasks, time for 3rd part of the tasks. Everything is screwed up just with a couple of dozens of tasks. Don't see how to trust it further. Cancelling subscription now.",0
"Was really good, but after the last update, it's auto fill makes weird duplicates of whatever I'm typing. November 4th auto fills to November 44th. A cost reminder in the description goes from 80.90 to 80.908090. It is annoying to unuseable depending on task. I am guessing this happens because their auto correct is fighting with my phones(Samsung) built in auto correct but no idea.",0
"Why do developers keep changing things for the worse? I have been a paid pro user for close to a decade, and today the title bar popped back up onto my widget, which has not had one for as long as I can remember. So, I go to the settings to remove it (as I have in the past) and the setting is gone. Last week, the app stopped allowing me to say ""P1"", ""P2"", etc. for setting the priority on my to-do list items via voice-to-text as I have always done. So frustrating! Time to find a new to-do list...",0
"When scheduling repeat events and task is a headache. I really liked it, but I find myself using the help menu more frequently to schedule re occurring events. This has been time-consuming for me. Also, when I am initially inputting a new event or task I don't want to note it in the description section and I don't have the option to put all of the details in the notes section unless I close it out and reopen the task. Sadly, I'll be converting to another task manager",0
"Latest update has made the app completely useless. Can't open the app, can't refresh the widget, can't access any of my lists. Tried restarting my phone, force stopping the app, reinstalling the app, nothing has worked. Until this, I was a big fan of this app. Everything was very intuitive and easy to create collaborative lists for shared tasks. Having a widget was very convenient as well. Very sad to have to find a new alternative since this no longer works.",0
Very Difficult To understand,0
Fake google backup. It never work after buying the pro. And all users report same fake backup,0
bakwas,0
"I go for pro then backup to google drive didn't work, also I didn't find a help button to report the issue. I just found ""Help us"" button in settings. I don't know who should provide the help. Those people who made this app are out of logical brain.",0
"Just tried to use it. It showed some buttons during set up, including how to use Todoist. Turned it on, clicked on the sentence, finally continued on. I searched around, but never found help using the app. This might be a great app for people that know how to use it or are seasoned enough in apps to figure it out, but wherever the guidance is for those that don't know, it's buried too deeply to be any help. I was unable to do anything useful and, instead, a big waste of a chunk of my morning!",0
It used to be great when i last used it...later i uninstalled for some reasons. Now after installing again it totally changed. Earlier it was easy to make a time table. Now i have to select repeat everyday option eveytime i create schedule.,0
it dissappears after two days unless you pay so yeah useless,0
It just constantly stops sending notifications. I got my schedule setup and after two days it stopped alerting me at all. I can leave the program running in the background to receive notifications again but this isn't useful.,0
Worst,0
"I want to like this app, but there is so much wrong with it. For example: even though I'm clearing my days to start fresh after having applied templates, every day is still populated. So any day I input anything, it will overlap and I'll have to go in and delete every individual event. Don't like that you can't schedule anything overnight. There also seems to be a lot of bugs in it, so at this point, it might just be easier to do all of this in Samsung Calendar instead.",0
Every time I schedule something using the templates it makes duplicates. One change to the schedule throws off all other entries and everything overlaps. Most additions to my schedule cause me to have to alter the entire schedule just to make them fit and not just show them overlapping or double populated on the schedule. Why is there a learning curve for a scheduling app? Idk either. It should just work when you make entries.,0
Broken App. It keeps doubling up items in the schedule every day. Clearing doesn't work. Applying a blank template doesn't work. I can't manually delete them because it repeats for every single day. Furthermore - if I do manually delete them for a day then apply a template - they double up again.,0
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move",0
"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good.",0
Doesnt have a weekly timetable block view. You cant make block presets.,0
"Needed a good list for Wear OS use only (no phone), and this was almost perfect --- except there's no confirmation when marking a list item complete, so it's really easy to accidentally remove an item unintentionally, and it's impossible to undo a completion from the watch interface. So close, and yet so far.",0
"A useful to do list app with great features, but consistently getting updates making features work worse and decreasing the stability of the app. Recent updates have even shuffled the app layout to be more reflective of a social media app than a to do list app. Cannot recommend based on the downward trajectory; canceled my pro subscription myself.",0
Very annoying app. Frequently pops annoying notices about made-up goals and badges while I'm trying to get actual work done. I'm not joking. I was trying to get things done and it pops up an award or badge for getting 5 things done and then tells me that it was 5 more than yesterday. In what world do I care about their stupid goals for me??? I have to waste my time reading the messages in case they are actually important.,0
"Poor theming and dynamic color implementation spoils an otherwise promising task management app. Biggest offender is the widgets, which use colors differently than other dynamic color widgets and most frustratingly of all don't sync their dark and light mode automatically with the system setting, despite the main app doing so. Frustrating to have a single widget be blindly white at night when everything else on my home screen has changed to dark mode theme.",0
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease.",0
"The app is too complicated and has too many features that are not intuitive or user-friendly,too expensive and requires a premium subscription to access most features1too buggy and has sync issues, data loss, crashes, and glitches,The app is too restrictive and does not allow users to customize their tasks, projects, or labelsThe app is too slow and consumes a lot of battery and memory",0
"I didn't even get to use this app because ""reminders are a premium feature"". Anything to exploit money out of people. Basic functions of a planner shouldn't be a ""premium paid feature"". You want fancy backgrounds or other personalization? Charge for it. Special notification sounds? Charge for it. But a simple reminder (the whole point of a freaking planner) should be free.",0
"Worthless app. Have been using the premium version for 6 months now, and much preferred the previous free version from over a year ago that had the auto reschedule function in case you actually try to intentionally write down more than you can accomplish in a day to make sure things don't fall through the crack. Wish I had known thay feature was removed before purchasing, but without it, it's actually more work than just writing it as a simple checklist.",0
"I used the app for about 3 days before realizing it wasn't a good fit for me. I wanted to use the widget more than the app itself, but I was frustrated with the way recurring events and subtasks work. I even checked reddit and online for a solution, but without success. Instead of listing subtasks as same priority as the parent task during scheduling, I wanted things to remain nested and recurring. After attempting to make things work, I gave up and tried TickTick instead, which has been better!",0
"Downloaded the app so I could have a widget with my list on my home screen. shortly thereafter, tney added checkboxes, which can't be turned off, making it easy to accidentally ""complete"" a task on the widget. And unlike when you have the app open, this can't be undone. It was good when I downloaded it, but is now completely useless.",0
"I'm doing what I decry - leaving a bad review even though I didn't try the product. I just want to say I don't mind paying for an app if it's worth it. Developers should get paid for good work. This one, however, requires a subscription. I had to install it and create an account before I could find out the upgrade cost. The cost isn't terrible for a good app, but I'm not buying another subscription for for another thing. I'm really getting tired of everything requiring subscriptions.",0
"I've heard such good things and I was so excited to try this app... but it just keeps crashing. My phone tells me it has a bug. Now I'm just disappointed. Original review in Feb 2023 Update Oct 2023: Still can't use it. Anytime I try to add a task it just closes. It gives me a warning that the app is buggy and to update and try again once the developer fixes the bugs. Clearly the bugs the developer supposedly worked out are still there. I did get a little farther, at least I got the app to open",0
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.",0
I really wanted to like this app but there is no way to order items on todo lists. I have at this point had to reorder all of my items over 10 times for each because when u use the drag and drop menu to change the order it doesn't save it permanently there is also no way to sort your todo lists by date because I figured if I input a deadline for each item it would show me what I had to do with the one due the soonest at the top but no. I wish there were more ways to sort or at least filter date,0
I set multiple test reminders to see what kind of notification I'd receive and I haven't gotten a single one. I checked permissions and settings to make sure nothing turned off by default. I set a few at different times for reminders and they all passed by with nothing. No push or emails or anything. I can't exactly recommend using a reminder app that doesn't actually give you reminders.,0
"SEIZURE RISK!!!! I have had this app for years and recommended it to many people, as it worked perfectly for me. After the latest update, however, the widget became stuck in a constant reload cycle that causes it to strobe on the screen. I immediately tried to delete the widget, but the upload cycle prevents you from being able to delete the widget as well. It almost triggered a seizure. The developers need to fix whatever mistake they made in the update ASAP.",0
"No easy way to view your completed tasks. Everything else about this app is great, but this one missing feature is a HUGE dealbreaker. For 90% of people, the benefit of a todo list is to see what you have done easily, and get a sense of achievement from it.

"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.",0
"To start, notifications shouldn't be a premium feature. The main reason I want a to-do list on my phone is so I can get more from it, including reminders. Second, even the free features didn't function as the guide said they would. I tried to add a recurring task for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as per the instructions, but it wouldn't even do that. Edit2: sent image confirming smart recog is on, but you can't screenshot with the keyboard on and cannot turn keyboard off while setting time.",0
"What is the point of a ""To Do"" list without reminders? Nope, you don't get a notification reminder unless you pay for premium, you can't even try it to see if it will work better than Microsoft To-Do (which can't stay running for anything). Without notifications/alarms I can make a ""To Do"" list using a notebook & pen or the paper calendar I have on my fridge! The whole point of searching for a useful app is to use modern features, like reminders/alarms & custom days, dates, & times.",0
"I recently completed the forced upgrade for the app, and now it doesn't work consistently.....repeatedly, the app has frozen up completely and none of my tasks appear. If I'm able to get it working again (aftet multiple restarts), all the changes i made in recent sessions are gone. It worked perfectly before. I'm SO annoyed! I've been a todoist user for years, but if this isn't fixed, I'll switch to something that works consistently (already made that switch, for work projects).",0
Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data.... Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks. They claim all your information is backed up securely but when I asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments.,0
too complex for a plain grocery list. If I were mega OCD I'd probably love it.,0

"Had to go back and update my review, as some things really have changed since 2020, and the biggest issue is needing to pay ¬£50 a year for reminders. Reminders!

March 2023 Update: Keeping that one star rating because I was forced to update the app and it sucks yet again. I can't just highlight something in the schedule and move it with the arrows like I used to because the arrows are not there. The template aspect of this new update is also terrible and confusing. Why can't you guys just fix the glitches if there are any and leave everything else alone? There's no need to revamp this app everytime there's an update. Keep it simple.,0

Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings..

I found it odd that the app didn't have preset hourly reminders. Most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours (for example; gyming twice or thrice a day) the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you Another example of this would be:  Reminder: on every Thursdays at 7am and 8pm I should be reminded of (insert habit).

Paid for lifetime premium for this app before back when it was a one time payment then they kept the money and in order to for me to get premium again they want a subscription fee. Not worth it. Your calender has the same function.,0
I have 9 routines in the apps. Each routine has different schedule. I could use 1 or 2 routines active and I could choose what routines should be inactive. Now I can not select my own and all are those routines are showing as templates and all are active same time. Getting notification from each routines and can not deselect any specific routine.

Uninstalled within 10 minutes of confusion. What to set where. Not user friendly. Not able to set routines daily programmes. Very confusing settings.,0
It used to be great when i last used it...later i uninstalled for some reasons. Now after installing again it totally changed. Earlier it was easy to make a time table. Now i have to select repeat everyday option eveytime i create schedule.,0
"I bought the premium version but the widget is just too bad, it just becomes blank and translucent rendering the widget useless. Please fix this.",0
"This app was better before the update.... Now I don't know which day I am editing... Most of the people have a holiday per week where the routines differ... If everyday is number as 1,2,3... I won't get it which day is the weekend... At least add a feature like changing the name of the headers",0
Its good but too rigid.. Add option to start the routine from a speicifc place as we wish... Say we wake up late.. I want to start the routine late instead of just going late at the old routine. .. Add a button for that please,0
Earlier version had option of switching routines on and off. But the new version hasn't such option. Now I have to delete that template if not in use. This is the worst update. Please fix it ASAP.,0
"Pop up stating "" the app has been blocked by the system. Please authorize the app in your device settings. Troubleshooting or refresh background tasks "" is flashing on my device. May I know what is this about?",0

"Why did you change the font color from white to red in the dark theme of the widget? It was so much better in white. Please change it back, or at least put an option to choose font color",0
too complex for a plain grocery list. If I were mega OCD I'd probably love it.,0
Devs pls give us an option to set custom font (ttf file) for the widget and add shadow to the widget font. The current widget lacks basic customisability which makes it look very clunky in custom launcher setups. PLEASE add these options. üôèüèΩ,0

I created several test tasks to check what the problem is to no avail. Battery optimisation disabled, app reinstalled, notifications enabled. The reminder only comes through if I have the app open. What's the point? Glad I only subscribed for a month. I loved the app experience but sadly I'll have to switch.",0

"Had this app for years. Tonight it started randomly crashing repeatedly, even though I hadn't opened it up since my last restart, and I did a forced stop. Something very fishy is going on. I'm uninstalling it",0
"Does not synchrize tasks properly, my people see different tasks than I do, even after after app updates, refreshes, and giving it some time. List titles also fail to update. 2 stars cause it works ok if all you need is an app with no collaboration.",0
5 Star App let down by 1 Star Pricing. For basic users like me it's simply not worth ¬£4 a month subscription to add the Reminders feature I need and a bunch of other features I'll never use. Would happily pay a one-off ¬£4 fee to add reminders.... but went back to Google Tasks which is nearly as good and free.,0
"This app would be better if it gave you the ability to repeat tasks. Most of my tasks need to be completed monthly, but it doesn't have the option to make a task repeat. I don't want to waste my time having to schedule the same task for every single month.",0
Seems like a pretty standard to do app. Importing templates doesn't work - I've tried various different ways to do it but it always just seems to freeze everything. Pro is too expensive.,0
"Latest version keeps crashing. 4-5 seconds after loading, it throws an error message. I can do a ""forced stop"" in Android Settings, but that only helps for a short time. It worked flawlessly for two years befor the August update.",0
"I reviewed the software to provide 80 projects in free version and collaborators. On installing the product today, it has reduced the projects and collaborators all of a sudden. I was so confused looking at the pricing page show different things all of a sudden to understand there has been an update. Though the app is good, but it's targeted towards premium users more than the basic users. Wouldn't serve the purpose. I guess I would have to program my own to get pretty basic features in an app!",0

"""how many tasks do I have today"" is gone?? I've read your blog, but couldn't find that it answers why I can't see anywhere the number of tasks I have, which seems like the most basic thing. My feedback is simple: I need to know how many tasks I have, and your new design is a strict regression in that sense. Put it in the ""today"" icon? I don't need to know the ""day of the month"", for instance.",0
"Good tool, not great. Deleted because it sent me emails which suggested it pulled too much personal information which I did not give it, such as my location, my phone's technical information which identifies the owner of said phone, etc. It did not directly ask permission for those things.

It might be good. It wasn't what I needed. Deleted the app. Still getting emails. Have to reinstall the app to turn off the notifications or delete your account. Reinstalled. Tried to delete account. Now I need to set up a password because I signed in with Google. Go to account settings to set password. I go to account settings. Can I see anywhere to set a password? Nope. FML.,0
Since last update the app crashes when using widgets,0
"There's now an option to set a time when scheduling tasks, which I thought was great. Unfortunately the app also scheduled a duration by default, even though that's a feature for paying users only. As an unpaid subscriber, I couldn't adjust or remove task durations that have been automatically applied. I had to subscribe in order to access the button to turn them off. Very irritating, but I suppose it forces people to subscribe which might be the point.",0

"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!)

This rendered the app useless to me so I've uninstalled it, nice work team.",0

"Everything WAS alright but then an update happened. I thought it would only affect the visual aspect but no. It causes lots of bugs. I cannot open projects, no tasks are showing in them.

"Nice look and feel but integrations are random and hopeless. Syncing with Google calendar either doesn't work at all or creates endless duplicates. Which have to be deleted individually. The lack of integrated time recording is annoying. There are other alternatives with fewer issues. After a couple of pandemic years perseverance, I've moved on",0
"I'm currently using todoist premium, and unfortunately it ain't worth it. There are lot of restrictions in free version i.e., a simple thing as reminder option (really? Any free app allows that function). Also, it doesn't have any proper calendar view like Google Calendar. The Date parsing and natural language works fine. Other than that, I didn't find anything worth buying premium and free version doesn't provide much functions. There are other apps like TickTick that's same but better. üëçüèº",0
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",0
"This app will nag you every day ""you have 7 tasks today"" for weeks and months, it never stops. I realised today the way this works, I will never ever do those tasks because I'm sick of getting nagged at, so I deleted all tasks and finally I'm free.",0
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its ¬£3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,0
"Not worth trying this for the reminders as they removed them from the free version. Sure maybe this is worth paying for for all the project management stuff, but for us who just want a very basic Todo list with reminders, this will not work without paying a subscription. I would have paid a once off for this for a basic Todo notifications version, but alas, they want to go too far into the ""as a service"" model.",0
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.",0
"Very good app. I have recommended this to so many of my friends. However, I have paid for an annual subscription for the pro version, but then a month later, I'm unable to use the original pro settings like having multiple projects and setting reminders. Due to new packages introduced to the app, it appears I don't have the access that I've originally paid for, and I've been prompting me to upgrade again. I've tried multiple times to make contact with them to no avail. Please help me understand",0
"I was initially excited, got it all set up with various projects used it for about w week or so , but now it will only open for a second before ""stopping"" I close it multiple times,but no change . I have sent feedback. I don't want to lose what I've already put in there , but wonder if uninstalling and installing would make a difference. Hope some maybe able to help",0
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",0
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.,0
"The app is simple and easy to use, so I decided to go ahead with premium because I need reminders. Sadly, such simple feature like getting reminded about a task does not work consistently at all! - If you set up a reminder from the web, you may not get it at all and if you get it - the push notification on mobile is missing. - If you setup a reminder on your mobile you get only push notification and some times web, too. - There is no option for alarm or just playing some sound on web",0
"Used to be 4/5. I found it useful for a while, but they recently redesigned the apps and made it difficult to find anything. They may as well get rid of all of the other buttons and just leave a search box because that's the only way I can find a specific task now. Will unfortunately need to find another task app that doesn't feel the need to redesign a perfectly functional UI into one that neither works better, nor matches their web UI.",0
"I've been using Todoist for a while, but I've backed off because it's frustrating to work with. It's very difficult to get a good view of to-dos since my day regularly ends after midnight. Other apps have a ""choose your day start/end time"" feature, albeit with less functionality than Todoist. It just strikes me as classist and ableist that this is one of the most requested features & they refuse to add it in.",0
"Paying a monthly fee is not acceptable IMO. I would gladly pay a one time fee for it. I still use apps from years ago that are still used from one phone to the next. If I had to pay a monthly fee to keep those this whole time would be way too much for what they're worth. This is a good app, with plenty of features, but not worth $36 a year.",0
"I was very much enjoying this app, then a new update came in that has made it almost useless to me. I thought it was a visual change but now I cannot even save my reminders or anything and putting in a date is so difficult because if it doesn't like the way you put it in it just does not register as a date. I may change my opinion if they fix these issues but I may have to find something else if they don't.",0
"Giving Todoist a 2-star review because the sync issues are so frequent that it makes the app a pain to use. Real shame because the interface is really sleek and there are some great features. Sync issues I've encountered: - I try to add a task and it doesn't actually add because it didn't sync for some reason - I try to add a task using the laptop app and it doesn't add because sync issue - I try to move a task up in the list and it doesn't work, goes back to initial position",0
Conatant sync problems. Throwing errors when trying to view activity log. Not all actions of collaborators are logged. For example collaborator completed a task and it doesn't show in notifications. But sometimes it does. All in all very unpredictable app.,0
"Push notifications are locked behind in app purchases, so instead they decided to send you unrelated push notifications and emails that have no bearing on your due dates, plus your account is loaded up with all these preloaded tasks that you have to manually delete 1 by 1. There's no way to see what a normal notification would be because there is no trial version of the app for premium features.",0
"This app has been great for synchronising our chores and lists in the family, but wince several updates ago the process of completing checklists is completely unusable. The app re-renders several times every time you mark an item as completed. We have been unable to use it since, as it's way too slow.",0
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.",0
Goodside: It's very simple and handy that i appreciate it. Also good sync with Google calendar. Downside: But unfortunately there isn't multiple select for tasks or sub task to delete or move all selected at once. It's so overwhelming to delete multiple tasks in very long and hard way,0
"It's a great productivity tool but with reminders behind an expensive per month paywall, it lacks probably the most important function. I'd try something else, despite the great UI It's a good app, I'd pay for it if it was a one off payment but ‚Ç¨30 a year? That's too much.",0
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.",0
"Constant emails from you guys. I've not used the app enough to give an honest review about the app itself as I've been too busy at the minute to properly check it out. But you're constantly emailing me, everyday with tips and tricks. To the point where you're just coming across needy and forceful. Deleting your app. Please, stop emailing me.",0
"Keeps Crashing. I just got it today and thought that I would give one month of premium a try. But it keeps crashing and I've restarted my phone already once.. I don't want to have to keep doing that. I don't even think that I'll play with it until my month is up. Plus I thought that I could link up my Google calendar to it, but I can't.",0
Your reminder system could use some improvements please. If we could just click the clock and a watch would pop up where we just input the time or you suggest intervals of 30 min or 1 hour. At the moment we have to type out the time and it's not efficient. I use the app for my sales team 8 hours a day. Please do something about this.,0
"Update: Unfortunately the app is again repeatedly refusing to open, and I'm on my third reinstall in two days. Prev: Thanks, I just reinstalled and it is working again! :) This is an excellent app, and I particularly appreciate the ability to email tasks to the task inbox.",0

Seriously, give me a break... I'll just use Google Keep Notes after all...",0
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?",0
"Non-usable Don't bother I tried this app as a replacement to my current tasks app that I've used for years. I was looking for a task list that was always up to date on all devices. However it has not stopped crashing since I installed it. Both my phone and tablet experience the same problem. Seems to be when I am trying to drag and drop. Anyhoo, I'm still using my current app which is heads and shoulders above Todoist, both in usability and features.",0
"The latest update adds an extra step to switching to a filter. Normally clicking deeper into more menus is only mildly inconvenient, but after 2 years, there is still no real kanban view. I need a todo app that saves time, not becomes a time consuming activity in itself.",0
"I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",0
"Great experience so far. Only wish that the subtasks remain in the main task and does not show up in all task list with no due date. And a calander view would be nice. Shifted fr Ticktick to this one, and working out fine so far. However my really important notes (comments) suddenly disappeared. This I'm quitting the app. This is really critical and disappointing",0
"I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?",0
I stopped receiving notifications after an update of the app,0
"I've used this app since 2017 and it's been great. Unfortunately, now it's very buggy and has constant errors. Uninstalled/reinstalled & updated and it's no help. Frustrated to the point of ditching it, which would be a huge hassle.",0
"I used to love love love this app. I have it both on mobile and PC. BUT....recently it became a nuisance to use it on mobile.

"had this app for about a year. it was perfect for what i needed it for at first, but now it's practically unuseable. sections and tasks randomly duplicate and can't be deleted without also deleting unrelated items. i tried updating my app, which didn't help at all. sad to see it go, but i use my calendar every day, and the frustration of dealing with these glitches is simply not worth it!",0
"Very confusing to use. Recuring tasks just show on the day you don't do them. For example if you set a task recurring everyday, and you don't do it one day, it will not show the next day.",0
You need to purchase an upgrade for it to be at all useful.,0
I like the app but it's frustrating that you cannot adjust what time your day starts. I have untraditional hours so by the time I mark my recurring tasks it's after midnight so it doesn't occur for the next day. That's so frustrating.,0
"I decided to try this app out before work on a Sunday. The app immediately said ""enjoy your day off you deserve it"" but it was not my day off and I could not edit it, so I just stopped using it.",0
"Does not synchrize tasks properly, my people see different tasks than I do, even after after app updates, refreshes, and giving it some time. List titles also fail to update. 2 stars cause it works ok if all you need is an app with no collaboration.",0
"You have to pay for reminders, and I think that's stupid. Every single other app in the world sends me push notifications I DON'T want, and now, in the context of an app that keeps track of tasks you have to get done, notifications telling you to do those tasks are a premium service? Seriously, give me a break... I'll just use Google Keep Notes after all...",0
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS! I used it for one month, and now that I have gone through the cancelation procedure 3 times, I am still being charged. No humans to reach to, try to put in a ticket for contact, and all it is is a circle of ignorance an frustration. Again, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.",0
Make it simpler to use.,0
"It's very very costly for individual use .Can you roll out premium for Individual and family plan, instead of only team of upto 25people support? This would make it worth for user like me who uses this app for individual use and not for team level tracking",0
never ever has it rung any alarm how am I supposed to get notified coz I don't keep my phone in my hands all the time please help out then I'm sure it will be a great app,0
"Install to a new phone, with newest version. I'm confused now how this app works. I just want to make a routine schedule monday to friday all year round and not choosing a specific date. The feature seems gone now",0
App randomly stops working,0
"Instantly deleted. Paper calendar mentality; automatically removes past months and doesn't allow you to rewind, as if you threw out the previous page. But don't worry, you can set your calendar for the next ten years.",0
Can't do anything in the app once it's opened. It just freezes.,0
Very bad experience when I used this app. App is not working well it isn't notifying me by ringing the notification bell Bad experience,0
NEE UPDATE IS TRASH!!! ITS HARDER TO FIND THE SCHEDULER NOW AND YTF WOULD YOU ALL ERASE MON-WED AND REPLACE WITH DAY 1 - DAY 7? WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE TO MAKE ME TRY TO REMEMBER DAY 2 = Tues & DAY 4 = Thur and So On...,0
"In the blocks, why does a day start from 12AM...? I could not find any option to change it either... Even after setting sleep time.from 10 to 3, it still gets stuck at 12AM",0
Change is not always better. The app has changed alot over the past years that I have been using it and not for the better. The days of the week are no longer there so when I edit my sleeping time on day 7 it doesn't update day 1. Please put the days of the week back.,0
No set up walk through. Couldnt be bothered mess around and hope to work it out. Deleted after 5 mins. Also hate ads,0
In Purchase app don't have anything new as mentioned. And Blocks don't fly we have to edit them. Any How. Productibe but we do have better apps than in compare,0
No longer makes any sense. Was my favorite app now I can't even put my schedule in.,0
The schedule did not transfer on to the other days. It's a shame since I was recommended this app.,0
Actual features you want are behind a paywall.,0
Don't work thos apps and fake apps,0
"Old timetune app was better, uninstalled it now.",0
its not working fine on my phone.. The notification bar hide always..,0
"New update just ruined the app. I more liked the names of the week days rather than Day 1, Day 2 etc options. Moreover if you apply any template, it automatically duplicates everything. This is so frustrating!!",0
not reminding after 5days,0
Wrost update evwr,0
"It does nothing... No alarm, no message, no vibration... It is useless app... Reviews are not genuine",0
"This used to be the best app; I basically ran my life off it. Over the last couple of months, it has been crashing and saying there is a bug. I reached out to support, and after 3 weeks, they have yet to respond. Without being able to open the app, it is (obviously) unusable. Dear Todoist: Please respond to my 2 support emails. That would be dope. UPDATE: To whomever responded to this review, I have yet to be issued a support ticket number. I have sent a third email this morning. Cheers!",0
Why on earth would a to do list app need you to make an account?? There is no reason for that.,0
"Despite an intuitive interface, and positive initial impression, I was unable to get recurring events to show up properly on my ""upcoming"" calendar. Frustrating to schedule a routine item for ""every weekday at 7am"", see it reflected correctly in the task view, then look at your ""upcoming"" tab to have it only show it on the next day. I could not find any cases of others having this issue online, so maybe I'm just a moron. And morons leave 2-star reviews for things that are their own fault.",0
"It's not for free users at all. They've given 5 projects, including sub section? Are you kidding me? Go for ticktick instead, guys, or just use some first-party app like Microsoft to do or samsung reminder or Google tasks. Although they might lack some features but Microsoft to do it still has good enough features.",0
It's sad to see a simple feature I requested 2 years ago is still not added. Meanwhile other apps like ticktick have it since beginning,0
"Keeps Crashing. I just got it today and thought that I would give one month of premium a try. But it keeps crashing and I've restarted my phone already once.. I don't want to have to keep doing that. I don't even think that I'll play with it until my month is up. Plus I thought that I could link up my Google calendar to it, but I can't.",0
"Update: Unfortunately the app is again repeatedly refusing to open, and I'm on my third reinstall in two days. Prev: Thanks, I just reinstalled and it is working again! :) This is an excellent app, and I particularly appreciate the ability to email tasks to the task inbox.",0
Continually screws up the repetition schedule. Wants a subscription for basic useful features. I'm going back to my abandonware reminder app that handled these things well.,0
"The app used to be amazing, however it now does not function well and crashes often. It would've been 5 stars otherwise.",0
Totally inferior to Tick Tick. It has an integrated calendar... Just wasted $48.00 today,0
Totally dissatisfied and additionally frustrated since I witnessed errors while trying to erase my information prior to my signing out! I wish I would get back the time I lost!,0
Became very overwhelming very quickly despite me using these kinds of apps all the time. Would work for some people but just not for me.,0
"This app will nag you every day ""you have 7 tasks today"" for weeks and months, it never stops. I realised today the way this works, I will never ever do those tasks because I'm sick of getting nagged at, so I deleted all tasks and finally I'm free.",0
Request payment for reminders? Bye,0
"I really like Todoist in theory. It's just incredible how buggy the apps for Android and Windows have been for years now. Bugs remain in the app for such a long time, I'm having doubts anyone at the company uses their own app, which is never a good sign.",0
Subscription is not worth the money ...,0
No tile available on Samsung Watch,0
As others have said this app really needs its own tile with some sort of quick actions.,0
"Funny, asks you to rate after being buggy. Needs dialogs or loading signs if it's having issues making tasks",0
Reminders are PRO.,0
"Really frustrating not to see Ukrainian language interface, but only ""russian (Ukraine)"". Which is why I won't use the app any longer.",0
Overcomplicated af,0
Difficult to add items and navigate,0
"Cons: 0. Not as intuitive as TickTick app. 1. Its very hard to find that, you need to open the task name to reach the description space. 2. Its hard to find that, you need to paste items in the subtask name. 3. Can not comvert subtasks into note. 4. It can not work as a full featured note taking app. Note taking is very hard. If ""description"" section is used for note taking, then needs to click on ""show more"" to view full description.",0
"I've been using the Pro version for a number of years. I was never very happy with the subscription based model but the app was useful. Now I am told that the Pro subscription will renew at $48/year instead of the $29/year that I have been paying. For me, that large of a price increase just priced me out of their app.",0
"‚ÄéUseful but it needs a tile otherwise it is pretty useless on a watch, the complications are pretty useless and for me a time would change how much i look at my tasks",0
Newest update - items I reschedule for another day keep popping up for today,0
"honestly, it's not intuitive and it's way over-engineered. if you want to just have a task list, you have to battle the ""intelligence"" the whole time",0
Very very difficult to understand and use this app,0
"Best app for task lists, but have a biggest problem: it doesn't allow to the tasks to be reordered according to the user's preference, unfortunately they are limited by the priority and time, the tasks sort should be free to be reordered.",0
"I used this app for years and loved it. But recently they seem to have removed a feature that has eliminated a great deal of its function: the ability to set customized recurring reminders. This is a huge problem and has made it only half-usable. After years of being in the top percent of their users (something they also got rid of, their annual tracking), I am going to have to find a new app. It's a real shame, because I've been a premium user for so long and always really liked Todoist.",0
"Constant emails from you guys. I've not used the app enough to give an honest review about the app itself as I've been too busy at the minute to properly check it out. But you're constantly emailing me, everyday with tips and tricks. To the point where you're just coming across needy and forceful. Deleting your app. Please, stop emailing me.",0
the app on my phone does not recognize that i am paying for the pro version...how to i update that?,0
you need to pay for the premium version to unlock reminders. expensive.,0
App keeps crashing. It can't even last 10 seconds opened without crashing,0
"Dear support. Im using todoist for almost a decade years, its quite a lot. But recently your app is not working at all. It shows that app crashed everytime Samsung Galaxy Note 9, Android Thank you.",0
"Latest version keeps crashing. 4-5 seconds after loading, it throws an error message. I can do a ""forced stop"" in Android Settings, but that only helps for a short time. It worked flawlessly for two years befor the August update.",0
"This app drains your phone battery. I got this app as I was recommended it by a reddit post however I realised I preferred the traditional method of to do lists. Ultimately, I left it alone and forgot it existed. Since I've had the app in my library it ruined my phone battery. Today I got a notification saying this app was causing battery drainage. Be careful.",0
Since update it crashes constantly. For a subscription service that you depend on its worse than useless since it wastes your time,0
It's a good app but ever since yesterday the app will open but kicks me out.,0
"I was initially excited, got it all set up with various projects used it for about w week or so , but now it will only open for a second before ""stopping"" I close it multiple times,but no change . I have sent feedback. I don't want to lose what I've already put in there , but wonder if uninstalling and installing would make a difference. Hope some maybe able to help",0
"Good app, but it's constantly crashing these days. It's always telling me that it keeps stopping.",0
Id happily pay something for a good app but fifty pounds for a to do list is ridiculous.,0
"Had this app for years. Tonight it started randomly crashing repeatedly, even though I hadn't opened it up since my last restart, and I did a forced stop. Something very fishy is going on. I'm uninstalling it",0
"Not free, the app says you get two weeks free but requires you to put in your credit card information and you can cancel before trial period ends to not be charged. Yeah, no, I'm good.",0
There is a permanent banner ad about upgrading. It's very distracting.,0
"If app was available in a web browser format, It would definitely have five stars from me",0
"Was great; now not so much. I've been using for years but a recent update makes it where when I'm typing things, it'll just randomly highlight a word and remove it. It then randomly assigns it to date even though I pressed 'Today'. It's infuriating. For example I typed ""Go Christmas shopping today"" and the program gave me ""Go shopping today"" and assigned it to December 25th. Obviously, that's not at all what I was shooting for. These recent updates are making the app much worse than before!",0
Hasn't been meaningfully updated in a long time. Difficult to organize lists and save/archive. Very simple without the ability to add any details like quantity on a grocery list. Used to auto categorize but not working anymore. I still use it because it's easy to share with my wife and that's about it.,0
"Must register with email, Google or FB -- displaying your email address -- just to get onto app. Smack dab near beginning of setup process (full page, per each setting), a full page ad to buy premium version appears. Getting into app? -- Stayed just a min, with the boxed, staring at the boxed, text notification that we have seven (7) days to try app for free. Already concerned about/not liking having to register online to use, stopped setup process, at that page. Uninstalling right now.",0
"This is a good app with somewhat helpful widgets. The widget calendar should include tasks on individual days. Events and their notification settings are lacking. If I want to be notified 2 weeks in advance, I simply can't.. In Google Calender, I can set it 4 weeks in advance. With this app I have to set the event date 1 week before it happens and set the notification to 1 week in advance in order to get 2 week notice. These restrictions are a dealbreaker.",0
"I like it at lot, but it seems like recently, this v thing is taking out my battery, hogging memory, and using data more than chrome which I use constantly. Until someone can help me figure this out, or if this high usage of phone resources is normal, I can't rate it any higher. I might even have to remove it and search for an alternative.",0
"I liked the app, but it is not opening anymore on my android note 20. Also, you may want to add ""Are you sure you want to delete / show completed"" pop up window on all the items. I have lost so many things because the app was lagging and it clicked when I didn't want it too. What a nuisance. Please fix it so I can use it again.",0
"The concept is good but the execution lacks. There are constant issues with server sync, and since the server side has priority, updates I make on the phone regularly get wiped out. Every so often the app will prompt me to log in again when I open it...this time it just kicked me out while I was actively using it and updating a list, made me log in again, and didn't keep anything I had already done! My wife already gave up on it and I will probably look elsewhere too",0
"I keep going back to this to see if anything has been fixed or added, every time I'm disappointed. Smart Shopping List is about as dumb a Shopping List as can be. You cannot add or delete categories, you're stuck with whatever categories they seem fit to give you which are grocery based. If you're planning on using it for something like a hardware store and need Building Supplies, Electrical, Plumbing etc you're out of luck. You can't even add Quantity! Isn't that usually a basic feature of a shopping list?! So if you add Potatoes, how many? 5lbs? 1lbs? who knows.",0
"Once the app reinstalled itself and I lost everything. I still have no idea why it did this. Also, it often doesn't open when I first tap the icon. If I tap it multiple times it eventually opens within a particular task. I found it frustrating and I've now uninstalled it. It would be a great app if some of these bugs could be resolved.",0
"Stop forcing symbols into dates! I use a lot of fractions in my work and not being able to change the auto-correct to format it as a date is incredibly frustrating! 3/4 is not March 4th to me! Nor is 3-4 or 3.4! At least not when I include it in the title of my item! I have been having to double click into every single item on my list just to remove the improperly translated data. Include a way to toggle this off in settings, or give the user the auto-correct OPTION instead of forcing it. I paid $36 for this app to save time, not so I can beta test it for you!",0
Have on and off tried this app for years. Finally committed & signed up for the yearly plan but I regret my decision. The desktop app constantly displays the new update bar at the top of the window and every single time that I have 'updated' I have lost data. Nothing too major until I recently put in a kind of extensive task w/subtasks only to open the app on my phone and discover it had all been deleted along with a few tasks I set for later completion. Decent interface but won't be renewing.,0
"Just trying it out. Seems like a great app but has a really, really basic miss that I saw referenced in another review: Theres no intuitive way to specify or change the time of a task. Tasks are all just all automatically set for 9 am and theres not visable button or option to change the time. The other user mentioned trying to use Google to figure out how. But such a basic miss seems like a flag that maybe I should try a different app.",0
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.,0
"Spent 2 hours tinkering with this app just to realize that it can't do what I need it to do. It's quite frustrating that no digital planner has the option of showing future tasks before they're due. I have a task that's due every third Wednesday of the month. I want to see that task on my calendar 3 months ahead so I can plan around it. But nope, the task won't appear until it's marked complete in the previous month. Pointless! How can that feature possibly be helpful for anyone??",0
"I'm afraid the app promises a lot but doesn't deliver. I rely heavily in To Do in the office suite. I was looking for a few more features but integration was important to me. The promised integration comes through Zapier which requires get another premium subscription ($20 per month). Zapier is extremely confusing and time consuming. This just isn't any better than To Do and honestly One Note blows it out of the water. If you're already paying for office, don't waste your time here.",0
"I want a day planner that lets me set a time for tasks without there always being a reminder notification. This app can't seem to provide that. I'm also not happy with how the free option wasn't made available to me during sign up. Seems fishy to say ""free forever"" on the homepage, but when it comes to signing up, I only saw a 7 day free trial. The help section was a joke, so I unsubscribed immediately.",0
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess.",0
"Grocery list is disappointing While the overall app experience is good, the grocery list feature is quite a disappointment. It is just not usable in its current state.. Any.do states it is not a primary feature but it is prominently touted on their website and in the Play store description. I expect a grocery list to allow me to add quantities, brand names and categories that make sense to me, ie vegan or kosher or liquor, etc. Back to using pen and paper for this type of activity!",0
"(edit) In response to reply, THERE IS NO '+'! On the side, only bottom bar. If a list is empty there is only bottom bar!... No tasks here yet, start adding tasks by tapping the '+' button. Well the '+' doesn't exist or the greyed out background one doesn't have a function... Only the bottom bar exists. Seems like an oversight with the design of this app, can't believe it hasn't been corrected to this day. Any.do has been around for a while with several updates, so wake up you lazy devs",0
"UPDATE: reply doesn't address the issue - you took a free feature away and require a subscription to access it now. Unless I am misunderstanding? I wanted a simple app to share grocery lists and manage some personal tasks but they just restricted access to sharing without paying a monthly fee. Even before this, there were frustrating restrictions on lists and it's a bit clunky/buggy when navigating and scheduling recurring tasks. So I'm finding another app as I am unwilling to pay for this one.",0
Has decent features but is mostly a cash grab for what is available in many others for free. This doesn't do anything particularly better than the rest and repeatedly attempts to get you to pay a recurring subscription while hiding collaborative features behind a paywall.,0
"Not very intuitive and smart typing doesn't work across the different views; you have to be in a specific list. It's more convenient to be able to quickly add a task to a specific list from anywhere. Also, lack of task duration doesn't encourage practical planning; users can get carried away by adding too many tasks for a particular day and not achieve them despite all their planning. Stable desktop & mobile app; experienced no problems with syncing.",0
"Nawww, sorry your yearly subscription price scared me off. By the time I've subscribed to every app I consider helpful I'm spending waaay too much. I would have liked it but I have other much more important bills to pay. The low stars is due to the price and there's no point in coming back to justify it because it'll still be too much for me. Edit: I know that I can use it for free, but then I'd still have to put up with ads. Surprisingly I don't like ads. I still consider your sub too much.",0
"Frustrating to use. I set up tasks to repeat weekly and of the five, one showed up for the following week but then disappeared and the rest only appeared for the first week. I've triple checkd the settings and they are all set to repeat each Monday. It's another one of those apps that claims to save you time but ends up being a time sink as you mess about with the settings trying to get the damn thing to do the basics.",0
"Still the same issue, 3 years later..I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time. Please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box. Thanks",0
"Look this app had potential, but there are a ton of efficiency type issues. For example, if in a list and hit back on phone, it closes the app instead of going back a menu option. Accidentally clicked a task and crossed it off, gonna need remake it. I really want to like this app, and been using it for a while. But ever update i see is usually something like changing color scheme options or something. Been premium and used the app for a few yrs now hoping updates would come, they haven't...",0
"I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports",0
"I've had a subscription for years. I used to be able to invite/assign tasks to colleagues etc, but now I can't without a better subscription so that's frustrating. The navigation of the mobile app and web are both frustrating. I feel I'm going to have to invest a lot of time in upskilling to the features which is also frustrating, and who knows where I go to find those resources.",0
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys.",0
"What a letdown. Forces you to use your device's native calendar with no option to change. Most apps let you connect with an account directly, but this made me use the Samsung calendar, which I have had nothing but issues with. ""Integration"" options through Zapier offer automation for new events but not a general account sync. Desktop and mobile differences are confusing. I can add my Google account to desktop, but it won't show the events on mobile? Poorly executed, really disappointed",0
"It constantly crashes and misses a lot of functionality. Hard to use and annoys with some popups that can be discarded only by closing app and then opening it again and permanent noticfaction that CAN'T be disabled. Payd 30 euro for this and used for month before it got so annoying that I started to look for another app. Fortunately I found one - Todoist. It's unbelievable how much better that is. Also there is version of todoist for PC, for your smart watch and even as browser extension which allows you to easily set a certain web page as task. And all these are synced.",0
Annoying constant reminders to upgrade. Blocking the screen when I type. I'm sure I can find something better out there. Uninstalling,0
Was an incredible app before they decided to completely overhaul it. Mine was updated a few days ago and now it's glitchy like crazy and I feel like I'm learning a whole new app. I'm now seriously considering cancelling my subscription and going with a different reminder app. The one that comes free on my Samsung phone works very well and has almost all the same functions.,0
I tried the app a long while ago. Thought I'd take another look. It's great that the developers provided their full address in Tel Aviv. That's a great thing for me but I thought a double click street view and glad I did. The company is in a Very run down building in a very slum-like neighbourhood. I 'walked around' & was extremely surprised by the level of poverty in all the surrounding streets. I wish I hadn't looked. It's sad. I'm not being critical. ButI suggest a closer look at the building,0
The setting on my app changed when I updated the app. it no longer categories your list for you. The sharing option is a cool figure but it does not update when two more people are checking off or adding to the list.,0
Removing family sharing options and charging $10 a month is ridiculous. Sad that I'll have to find another app as this one is pretty good.,0
"6th March 2024. I'm reducing my review, even still being Anydo's user for a while now. It's laggy and it needs a desparate feature such as in my all my tasks on a particular day, it should Automatically added into my Day. Sorry.",0
"Is there a way to see the sub tasks on the ""My Day"" page? Thanks for the reply. However, I was wondering whether there was a feature/option to see the subtasks (with an indentation) on the ""my day"" page. I tend to forget which tasks I've assigned subtasks to.",0
Works fine on Android. Fails miserably when connected to my laptop via phone link. It will not maintain laptop keyboard functionality. Makes the whole process inefficient.,0
"Once it was good, but now: extremely bad UI-design with lots of steps to set simple reminders; notifications don't appear; internal design and mechanics contradictions; setting exact time is the pain in comparison with the previous versions. I understand that lots of IT-programmers have to do something to get extra bonuses, but not making the app worse! It also seems that Any.Do team doesn't know the A/B test processes and live experience checking. Otherwise they could understand the difficulties of current design and withdraw the changes. Current version of the app - easiest target for the criticism with many points to mention.",0
"I am a paid user of this app. I like this app a lot, until Android 10. They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day. So it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between. Not cool. üëé",0
"Easy setup for the most part but ended up deleting it. Only one level of subtasks makes the to do list suboptimal. Only links to Google based calendars so my work, school and personal calendars aren't seen. [there is a disconnect between the app and the referenced article's options and instructions]. I don't mind paying for premium features as long as it is a one-time payment, the whole SAAS model is annoying.",0
"Very buggy. I've had syncing issues with recurring tasks and now when I open the app, the add task pop up appears at the bottom of my screen. I have to back out of that every time just so I can see my calendar or list of tasks. For an app that claims it will save you time, I've found the opposite to be true. I'll attempt to use it until my subscription is up for renewal. Definitely not worth the $35.99 I spent and I won't be investing in another year.",0
"Had this for quite a while now, and discovered that my daily reminder just packs up after about 3-4 days and reminders just stop. I reset the daily reminders, same thing happens again. Thing is, it's irritated me that much that now I remember the daily task because I remember that the app will likely forget about it, so I actually don't need the app any more. If you're looking for reliability, look elsewhere.",0
"This is not a note app, this is just a mountain of ads.",0
too expensive,0
"Why did you ruin great programm, formerly it was 5+++, very easy and managable, think about",0
I am unable to assign task to anyone on WhatsApp,0
"Stupid design. Require multiple actions to get to agenda view, tasks disappear, today not highlighted in widget,poor navigation so unintuitive. The UX has dropped drastically and is still becoming focused on promoting the premium version. Not only this changes make me exclude the premium option, I'm seriously considering uninstalling this garbage",0
so many pop-ups and pushy marketing,0
"The application is not working properly. I've already tried cancelling the subscription coz I was not at all happy with the application, then too my yearly subscription charges are deducted.. Neither this application has customer helpline not the proper email id.. Kindly do the needful and refund my amount ASAP..",0

"After many years I gave it another try. The app has somewhat improved, but now it's spamming emails and notifications for premium. If I'm interested in a premium feature, I will search far and wide in the world to find it. Why do companies assume they need to spam in my face thinking I'm going to buy it? There's much more chance for me to delete the app than anything else.",0

"Recurring subscription fees with no option to buy the software once and for all => uninstalled and replaced with a better alternative that one can purchase instead of having to rent it, at a cost that is lower than the repeated rip-off from this one. As for their reply: no, this app does NOT offer anything that the alternatives would not include as well.",0
annoying subscription reminder,0
"So, on your site you say this: ""Free Forever. No credit card."" Lies, lies, lies... Was looking forward to using this until the upgrade option popped up... think I choose Tasks instead.",0
"Syncing with Alexa takes over 10-15 minutes which renders it unusable. Any.do, before you post your generic response: yes, I added the skill to my Alexa and, yes, I logged into my accounts. It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.",0
"The app would work great; if it only reminded you when you wanted it too... What I mean is, it would certainly remind me of my scheduled tasks. That great! But, it would also randomly interrupt me to ""plan my day"". If I didn't add something to my schedule, then I dont need a reminder. So stop fracking interrupting my daily phone use at random times, and sending me false notifications.",0
"Just started using it, creating my lists etc. Until I noticed the free version doesn't have such basic feature as adding a photo to a task (it lets you theoretically, but up to 1.5mb, which means that practically you can't take photos since they are bigger). You could add an option that auto shrinks the photos so they could be added in small resolution. This makes the free version impractical basically.",0
"I switched to Any.do when Wunderlist ended. I wanted a simple interface that let me share lists and tasks with my husband. Any.do did that, but in the least efficient way possible. Our initials are the same and tiles aren't customizable, so it was impossible to tell who a task was assigned to. The app always defaulted to tasks even if I had just been using a shopping list. It was a huge pain to navigate. Not what we needed at all.",0
"At first I thought 'wow this can do everything! It's exactly what I need.' When I downloaded it and got to test it out, I noticed the features I needed the most were on premium. I'm fine with that, but only if premium was a one time payment. Not monthly payments for a membership. Monthly payments are for bills, taxes, video subscriptions, vpns, maybe even online storage subscriptions, but most definitely not calendars or to do lists. Those should stay as free or a small one time payment.",0
"The latest update is terrible. I always organized everything by date of the reminder, which is usually set on the day that it's due, but now I can't even see the due date of each task. I have to click on each task for the the date to appear. In addition, I usually organize each task by tags, the date, recurring if needed, and other details. There's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore. You have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want. I use the app begrudgingly.",0
"I really love the app, but the lack of full calendar month view is a major hindrance for me. Also, it would be nice to sync Google tasks and anydo Tasks, it syncs the calendar why the tasks as well? I wish these 2 features were added. I would be set. By the way I love the major feature: (the bottom pop up for Tasks that are do. I love how it interrupts and lets me decide what I want to do.",0
"It's a mess. I add new tasks and tag them. But they will randomly disappear, reappear. And the tags will disappear. Editing and adding them back in doesn't help because once a tag disappears you can't add it back in again. Disappearing tasks is the worst because there's no warning. They're just gone. They're not listed as complete, they just disappear. Sometimes they'll come back but sometimes I have to re-enter them...assuming I remember. I pay for this app, so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable. It may have something to do with syncing... no idea. But either way, I'm going to use another app because I just don't trust it anymore. These errors seem to be recent, like in the last 3 months.",0
"too much and does not easily integrate with Office 365. bummer. Trying to delete the account, and it errors out.",0
"I love this app and I really would give it a 5 star review, however, every few months the app stops syncing with my Alexa lists. So, in the meantime, while waiting for an update, I end up having to jump between 2 different apps to see everything that's been added to lists. The only reason I ever started using this app is because it was supposed to sync with Alexa consistently. That was supposed to make my life a whole lot easier. Instead I just end up frustrated.",0
"Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks. I had set an appointment for 1:30 but the app had automatically set it for 10:00 am and not allowing me to edit it. Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options.",0
"Need to go up to premium to really make it useful. Premium is $30+. Otherwise it is a basic calendar that ""might"" be as good as the one the phone come with. It could be easier to use, but I'm not putting the time into figuring that out when I'm asked to upgrade. It comes up almost everytime I try to use 1 of the options. The simplest of free calendars allows me more options than the free part of this calendar. I just deleted it. Not worth going through error reports right in the beginning.",0
"I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find.",0
"This app was great for me for a while, then I didn't need it for a whole. When I came back it seemed lackluster, but overall fine. What made me dump it was that the app appears to have teamed up with target or some other retailer and they would add stuff to your ""shopping list"" without your permission and I would get these pop-ups on my phone telling you they added some random product to your list. I never had a list nor used the products pushed and no way I saw to stop it.",0
"I found this app difficult to organize in a way that was useful for me. I couldn't separate which items showed up on my phone widget by topic, so it showed all of them which was unnecessary. I also found the reminders to plan my day annoying. It would be better with an improved calendar and prioritizing options. Last, it is extremely frustrating to try and unsubscribe from yearly renewal. It is buried deep in the info and the actual faq for this has a broken link. Super sketchy and rude.",0
bad,0

"Stupid popup reminding me to add reminders or do something covers my keypad and stays for a long time with no way to close it. I can't keep checked off items. It reminds me multiple times, every couple of seconds, to clear off the checked items, again blocking me. I can't move items between lists and if there is a way, it isn't easy enough for me to figure out. Cumbersome.",0
"Day 2 of trialling this. So far I've had two location reminders fail, I can't label a location with more than one letter, the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so I don't know what it sounds like, not that I can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work. I had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours. How is that a typical snooze length? Adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive",0
"When you move an item on the list from one day to another, it often jumps back to the previous day. It's a long-standing and annoying glitch",0
"Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view.",0
"Is there a way to see the sub tasks on the ""My Day"" page? Thanks for the reply. However, I was wondering whether there was a feature/option to see the subtasks (with an indentation) on the ""my day"" page. I tend to forget which tasks I've assigned subtasks to.",0

"UPDATE: reply doesn't address the issue - you took a free feature away and require a subscription to access it now. Unless I am misunderstanding? I wanted a simple app to share grocery lists and manage some personal tasks but they just restricted access to sharing without paying a monthly fee. Even before this, there were frustrating restrictions on lists and it's a bit clunky/buggy when navigating and scheduling recurring tasks. So I'm finding another app as I am unwilling to pay for this one.",0
just kinda.... meh,0
Removing family sharing options and charging $10 a month is ridiculous. Sad that I'll have to find another app as this one is pretty good.,0
"It was nice, but now it's becoming more and more unreliable.",0
Has decent features but is mostly a cash grab for what is available in many others for free. This doesn't do anything particularly better than the rest and repeatedly attempts to get you to pay a recurring subscription while hiding collaborative features behind a paywall.,0

it's cool but the pop up ads for premium subscriptions are annoying. sorry.,0
"6th March 2024. I'm reducing my review, even still being Anydo's user for a while now. It's laggy and it needs a desparate feature such as in my all my tasks on a particular day, it should Automatically added into my Day. Sorry.",0
"(edit) In response to reply, THERE IS NO '+'! On the side, only bottom bar. If a list is empty there is only bottom bar!... No tasks here yet, start adding tasks by tapping the '+' button. Well the '+' doesn't exist or the greyed out background one doesn't have a function... Only the bottom bar exists. Seems like an oversight with the design of this app, can't believe it hasn't been corrected to this day. Any.do has been around for a while with several updates, so wake up you lazy devs",0

Was an incredible app before they decided to completely overhaul it. Mine was updated a few days ago and now it's glitchy like crazy and I feel like I'm learning a whole new app. I'm now seriously considering cancelling my subscription and going with a different reminder app. The one that comes free on my Samsung phone works very well and has almost all the same functions.,0

Annoying constant reminders to upgrade. Blocking the screen when I type. I'm sure I can find something better out there. Uninstalling,0

I tried the app a long while ago. Thought I'd take another look. It's great that the developers provided their full address in Tel Aviv. That's a great thing for me but I thought a double click street view and glad I did. The company is in a Very run down building in a very slum-like neighbourhood. I 'walked around' & was extremely surprised by the level of poverty in all the surrounding streets. I wish I hadn't looked. It's sad. I'm not being critical. ButI suggest a closer look at the building,0

"It's extremely confusing. If you accidentally marked a repeating task as done and restore it, it shows multiple tasks including the original repeating tasks which date then shows the upcoming date. Marking a task with subtopics as done automatically marks everything is done instead of reminding you that it includes subtasks that needs to be completed... My ADHD can't with this app. It drives me mad.",0
"Frustrated that all the useful features are only for premium. not complaining that they are set up that way, but that they dont let you know until you are set up. Also its calendar wont work unless you import an external calendar? defeats the purpose of having a separate calendar. without premium its identical to a hundred other free apps.",0
"It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar‚Ä¶ not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!",0
"So we've been using this app for a while in conjunction with the Alexa skill (in Canada), which worked well until a few weeks back. Then it wouldn't sync things anymore. Any.do app and Alexa app were both up to date so I tried disabling the skill so I could reinstall and reconnect from scratch... Now it says the skill is ""not currently available"" so it looks like they ended support for this integration I guess?",0
"If you try to add something to the app using the share button, there seems to be a word limit. That means long website addresses won't get added in full and that makes me not rely on the app for saving links and such from across the web or whatever. Already done. They said to wait for a fix through an update around a month ago. Still none. Also, on your website it's says calendar is there on windows. There is no option in the app so where is it ? Neither in the webapp.",0
"Getting slightly annoyed at the new ""my day"" that has replaced Moments. Not only the list to choose from completely ignores that some tasks are already scheduled for later, but it is also impossible to reschedule on the fly using this function. I find it now much harder to organize coming tasks over the week than with the previous versions.",0
"The big downside for me that made me uninstall it is that only makes a simple sound like an incoming message. I need a sound like an incoming call that will continue until I close it, or at least will last for one minute. Otherwise if my phone is not close to me I am loosing the reminder. If this is not an issue for someone is a good application.",0
"This is a nicely made app and premium is cheap, but one critical flaw is the reminder sound runs through the ringtone channel instead of the alarm channel, or even the media channel. So unless you enjoy hearing every single notification go off on your phone or your ears are super sensitive to vibrations from across the room this app is not fit for purpose. A shame I just pooched my free trial now",0
"I find the app inflexible and buggy, with a counter intuitive UI. How to delete or rename tags was not obvious. Using the back button would often exit the app at unusual times. After adding a new tag the app wouldn't allow me to do anything until I exited and restarted. Plus, the premium features seem more like essential features, to me. Looking for an alternative app as we speak.",0
"The notification bar does not work. The ""Add Task"" option appears, I enter the task and click on the icon, there's just a progress spinner. The ""Close"" icon does not dismiss the notification bar either. How inconvenient. Had this issue in Oreo too. Right now I am on Nougat. Also the animations inside the app are slow. The icon where you tap to 'tick' the task is very small.",0
"every once in a while, sub-tasks just disappear",0
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this.",0
"Deleted review accidentally. 1. I create habit type tasks: the ones that repeat regularly. I don't even dream to have a habit/statistical section, but THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO SKIP OR FAIL THE REPEATABLE TASK. Now I only can delete it, but is is not representative way. 2. There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh. Just don't pretend you care, be straightforward, like, 'we won't do it in the nearest future, not in our plans'.",0
I've had this for years and rethinking it all. so many bugs for a paid version repeat function stops working from time to time. for example of I'm on a call during a pop up of a reminder the following day it stops repeating itself for whatever reason. another issue is the costum button which is far away and gets lost unless I'm very very careful which is annoying. and more issues,0
"Works well and looks good. Fantastic that it has Alexa support. But it's lack of decent widgets let's it down compared to similar apps. Separate lists should have separate widgets so that what I'm doing at a particular time can be focused on without having to open the app and without other lists and todos encroaching. I will keep an eye on it and resubscribe to pro if the widgets improve. Update: Now over a year. For me personally, there's been no improvement. Same limited widgets.",0
"I've had a paid subscription to this app since July 2020. I got it mainly because I want to add items to my grocery list via My Google Home devices using voice commands and I wanted an app that can manage both calendar events and tasks well. This app isn't it. I regret paying for a year's subscription. The grocery list functionality is very limited - you can't add price or even quantity. If you add recurring calendar events, there's no way to set an end date or set the number of occurrences.",0

"I used to depend on this app to basically run my life, until I installed the latest (as of Mar 19) update. Now it doesn't sync properly with my smartwatch -- ticking tasks off on my watch no longer marks them complete on my phone. Also, the widget is broken now, and doesn't reflect changes I've made unless I restart my phone. I sent a support request to the help team, but have gotten total radio silence. If they don't fix it, I'm cancelling my subscription. Right now it's not worth paying for.",0
"Used this for years, recently upgraded my phone and reinstalled the app. I've had nothing but problems since. I'm not getting any of my notification reminders. But the apps ads for their black Friday deal seems to come through fine. I can no longer recommend this app. And for the support person that reads this, yes the notification settings are turned on...",0
the price of this is outrageous to me,0
"Hard-to-read interface. Tiny font makes it such a strain. No contrast option available either, as far as I can tell. Reminder times are displayed in an even more unfriendly font. Not everyone has perfect vision. Disappointed that the creators of this app haven't thought this through.",0
"I was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs. Seemed ok, with limited use so far. The only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and Any.Do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day. I don't need it taking over things, i will plan when i want. Are you seriously doing this? It is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying.",0
I can't trust this app with my todos. Doesn't consistently save them and phone rotation deletes whatever I'm in the middle of writing.,0
Doesn't remove items from list when you finish it. still stays there. widget and app. I would like it gone. reduced to atoms. you can cross it off like it does. but I want it removed!,0
UX is poor like most of these app. The growing tree is an awesome idea... but that's it! The back button needs to be completely redefined. Sometimes I press it to hide the keyboard (like in most apps) and it goes back without saving the task name that I just input. The icon for lists needs to be changed... You cannot use one so similar to the standard icon for Menu! Subscription is yearly so if you don't cancel before the 7 test days... Bye-bye ¬£30! Unsubscribed and uninstalled now.,0
"I don't get it. It does the same as google calendar, and if you have work email at google, your events sorts automatically as well.",0
"I found it hard to get a calender not connected to my Google Calender or Google email. Once you do this, you have given Google even more access to your personal lives through giving them your whereabouts recorded on your calender. I understand some may want the upside of being able to back up their calender if something happens to their phones. I don't. My previous phone had a built in calender widget that did not require me to sync with Google in any way.",0
"I have paid for annual subscription. I thought it was worth paying for this app after going through the reviews and feedbacks from Google Play Store. Now, I repent that I have wasted my money. The reason for this comment is that notifications are getting delayed for set out reminders and also recurring reminders are disabled automatically. FYI I have disabled battery optimisation, allowed to run in the background, permitted to stay in recent apps and even allowed to auto launch. Fix this asap.",0
"I'm the premium user, and the app itself works fine for my needs, but guys, what happened to your web app? It just doesn't work for several days already! when I open Any.do website, I see 'EOF' and that's it! For me it's critical to have my task available on desktop, so two stars. (there are also other annoying bugs, both in mobile and web version).",0
"Seriously Lame! ‚Äì Seriously limited interface. ‚Äì Only a few characters can be used per entry. ‚Äì Not easy to use. ‚Äì Task entries are huge, taking up screen real estate. ‚Äì Doesn't handle projects. ‚Äì Doesn't connect with other major apps. ‚Äì Help system is ineffective. ‚Äì I don't see any.do being anywhere near as effective as my multi-point diary. Any.do doesn't ask enuf of the right questions. It's not engaging, but boring. ‚Äì Any.do is get getting left in the dust of the competition.",0
"Ill join with my fellow reviewers and say that i was very satisfied with the app when i started using it about two years ago, but since then i feel that its functionality and simplicity have been compromised, especially with the newest update that just made the app's interface (via smartphone) completely uncomfortable because i can't see my tasks laid out chronologically in an organized and pleasing way anymore.",0
"Tasks have become unmanageably buggy. Organizing from one colomn to another is almost impossible. The tasks keep going all the way to the bottom of the list almost every time, and won't respond if you press the ""completed"" circle to mark it off. Sorry. I wish this could get fixed. Otherwise the tasks become more of a hassle than productive.",0
"Exactly what I was looking for. 16/03/2021. There have been some updates since then which have really worsened this up making me consider uninstalling it. Please, please developers, revert it back to how it was 2 years ago :'( For example whereas before I could see the calendar by month, now I can see it only by week which is really inconvenient. It is also bugging and going to February from the current date.",0
So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.,0
I actually really love the app! I just have a lot of things planned into my schedule and I think it's too much for the app to handel so it crashes constantly which makes it almost impossible for me to stay on with out it crashing. sad because I really enjoy it üòî please fix this issue ASAP!!,0
The grocery list no longer has suggestions or categories,0
"List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!",0
"It's actually a really good app but because you can't disable pop up reminders it becomes really useless. Those pop ups disturb while doing other things with the phone and sometimes even block the screen while driving. I'd like to receive all notifications but only in the status bar, just like any other app.",0
"Editing this to respond this developer who recommended me to post my suggestion in UserVoice... I did support the idea (someone already suggested it). Multiple times... since 2017! An admin finally closed the idea with a giant green ""RELEASED"" label. However, it never worked. The pop up still goes off unless I completely disallow the notification which as I mentioned, it renders the reminder app completely useless. Added 1 more star for developer's responsiveness.",0
"Looks interesting but, despite saying 'in-app purchases', it doesn't mention that it's a 7 day free trial followed by a monthly subscription. When you're going to charge a recurring fee at least be up front about it. There are plenty of free or single payment calendar/note apps around that do the same job.",0
"I really liked the app for its simplicity. That changed tremendously with the recent updates. For example, it now takes me 10 clicks to postpone a single task! People use To Do apps to improve their efficiency, but this app isn't efficient anymore at all. I hope the simplicity comes back with future updates...",0

"This is not a multi-protocol task manager as the description false implies. This is a front end to their service. I couldn't get past the first screen because it requires me to set up an account to sync. I use a private server capable of syncing things like tasks, Exchange. Most public clouds (Google, iCloud, Office365, email providers) have this capability, therefore why should I need to send my data elsewhere if it's already on a server. The fact that data is not something you can touch doesn't make it less valuable. Be mindful of it, it *is* our most valuable asset today, it may not be tangible but it sure can be quantified endlessly. Requiring signing up for any app is a huge red flag.",0
"This overpriced app just keeps getting worse. Now, you can no longer add items using Google. careful...they don't notify you before charging your card for another year. Not an email or anything.

And although I have a ""Premium"" subscription, they want even more money to use all the features. I'm guessing the 5 star reviews are from when it worked.",0
"Keep getting (for the last month or so) the message that app is ""not responding"" and it freezes on initial page !!! Cannot switch between lists of things to do that I have created with out LONG delays ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ Cannot add or subtract from various lists without long delays ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ These problems have happened since last update !!! Hope u can fix this prob soon !!!",0
"App is getting worse instead of better. Latest version replaces homescreen widget that displayed five upcoming tasks with one that only displays three in the same space. All it gains in return is a useless ""Calendar"" button. WIdget colors that followed your main app theme replaced by ugly monochrome, too. I suspect they've put someone new in charge who decided they needed to ""shake things up"" with bad new ideas. Only bright spot is their tech support has been good.",0
"All of the great features such as list sharing grocery list categorization, and easy to use UI are being ""phased out."" I also got a charge of $39 dollars to my account without authorization for a ""yearly subscription"" when I had never had one before. Bad customer service and shady dealings.",0
"Theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum. They make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments, that's just how most of these apps work. You're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this.",0
"Terrible...Do not recommend Once downloaded, impossible to add a task. I tried the field at the bottom of the app, by clicking on Today, holding down on the app...when clicking enter, the app closed, no task. I restarted the app, my phone and it didn't work until I reinstalled the app. Spent hours setting up tasks, used the app all day with satisfaction and at the end of the day, opened the app to see all my tasks was were gone and the app looked as if I had never used it. UNACCEPTABLE",0
"The user interface is horrible. The way the tasks show up is very difficult to see and read at a glance, and the font in most places is so small it's not even readable. There are only five predefined color schemes for themes, none of them are at all attractive or easy to read. I set a reminder, and it didn't even go off. For an app this expensive, I would expect much more. There are a ton of free apps that are so much better than this one.",0
"I installed the app, but I didn't find it at all user friendly. Ex: Set up a BUY and everything from that point on was a guessing game. Saw on icon that looked like a LIST and thought I could create a list of things, so clicked on it, and a note advised my BUY task had been moved to a GROCERY LIST, with no indication given on how to get to the GROCERY LIST; not to mentiin the items I wanted to list under my BUY list were not groceries. I realized in pretty short order that despite the great features, thus app wasn't user friendly to anyine who did not already know ontuitively how to use it.ser friendly",0
"My experience was not good. ... it consolidated 8 ... lists for different stores in different regions into one ... list. This trashed all my completed items that were only appropriate to particular locations. Of course, this all back fed into Alexa... 48 hour update: Today found all Alexa items, pending and complete, gone. 72 hrs update: Appreciate their team reaching out, but I have moved on to AnyList.",0
"January 2021: In short..I'm done, and moving on from any.do. What was one of my ""go to"" apps, solid 5 stars, is now unreliable, buggy, and all i hear from support is ""well, our developers say thats 'intended behavior'.."". Well, when new so-called intended behavior now makes the app more unreliable, to the point of unusable, its time to find a new app to replace any.do. And thats exactly what I'll be doing, and then pushing the ""uninstall"" button for any.do. November 2020: This was a 4-5 star app for me for years, but now since what appears to have happened during a major update in October, I can't give more than 3 stars. I'm posting this here in the hopes that maybe others are experiencing the same issue, and that will prompt more serious investigation by the any.do staff. The issue I am seeing occurs when setting a reminder for a future date. Go thru the usual process, app records the reminder date/time correctly, then sometimes minutes, or even seconds later, the reminder shows up as a current task under ""today"". Its happening intermittently, but at least 50% of the time. I've used any.do for several years, so I know its not a situation of not knowing how to use the app. Clearing data and cache and reinstalling has not helped. Any.do support is trying to help, wants a video, but I can't take a video of every time I set a reminder hoping to catch the issue. Its unrealistic. If anyone else using the app is experiencing this issue, please please please let Any.do support know. I won't discount its an issue specific to my device, but the fact that the app ran fine for years, until an update, has me thinking otherwise.",0
"I have sent several bugs through the Any.do (both normal and priority) about a subscription issue that I have. According to the app, I am a Premium member. I have reached out to Support about discontinuing my subscription and hopefully getting a refund. When following Any.do's website directions to cancel my premium subscription, nothing showed up on the Play Store subscription managing page. Therefore, I cannot do anything, but hope that the Any.do team reaches out and helps resolve this issue.",0
"As like every other App. They want your money. Why, because they can! Because every other app charges. This one wants $3 per month or all you can do is 2 events per day. Don't fall for it keep searching. I might have considered paying if it was 3 dollars per year. If money doesn't bother you, then this app is fairly easy to use. Very intuitive and user friendly although I have used others under the Apple platform that were much better.",0
"I used to love this app. I have used it for years. I even had (until yesterday) the paid version. I primarily use this app to sync up my alexa tasks. It started having issues, then got fixed. Now the company is saying that Amazon sync is no longer usable (unless you want to add a 3rd party to allow it access to your Amazon account).",0
"Watch out if you get premium - you can only unsubscribe via the way you signed up. e.g. If you signed up on desktop you can't unsubscribe in the app. There isn't even a link to unsubscribe on the website. They don't send any renewal notifications so best thing to do is sign up and cancel premium straight away as you will still get to use it until the expiry date. That way if you end up removing the app you won't forget to unsubscribe. They could choose to be better, but don't",0
"I downloaded this because of the cross platform syncing. I only purchase apps after learning the free version. I see the potential but will delete because: 1) constant advertising the premium version - which is keeping me from being productive - which is counter productive 2) It seems on desktop version that I don't have a choice on calendar to see day, 3 days, week, month 3) and again the pop up for premium Anyway. On to the next planner app.",0
This app does not warn you when doing the trial that if you choose to cancel that you have to contact their support to do so. Theres a delete account option or a sign out one...they do the same thing and doesnt stop the payments. This doesnt stop them from charging you anyways and is a huge inconvenience. If it werent for this terrible service and unreasonable price I would have kept. Will not recommend.,0
"The option to sync with Google Assistant is completely useless - it doesn't work at all. It's like they added the feature just to trick people into downloading the app. I hate typing on my phone, so this was a huge disappointment. I wish I could give this app zero stars, but one star is the lowest option available. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this app at all costs.",0
"Bad, bad, bad. Tons of useless features/ bells and whistles which only serve to annoy and distract. Just tried to rename non Alexa list and couldn't. Just removed Alexa integration (the lists haven't updated in months anyhow) and my lists are gone, mind you with no warning. Adding it back doesn't help, lists are still gone. Rule number one is don't loose people's data for God's sake. Like most software today, over engineered over designed yet fails to perform its core functions half the time.",0
"I liked this app until recently. I discovered that items were being added to my shopping list without my input. I noticed a pop-up notification on my phone that an item was added. Viewing my list I saw several items that I did not add. I tried to work this out with the developer, but after informing me that they had a fix for the issue, they then followed up saying that they would not be releasing the fix. I assume they are receiving money for allowing products to hijack their paying customers.",0
"EDITED. So the app works as expected. It does location reminders (pay version) but they are simple notifications. No vibration option which is the point of a location notification. If I'm looking at my phone then I don't need Any.do, a simple Android notification will do. Can't see paying for this app when a less encompassing app will do the same thing be for free.",0
"Asked me to sign up for premium 4 times before even getting into the app and you can't see any sharing/family features without buying a month, which is what I wanted to see if it would work for us. Edited: you cannot see family features on the trial. The shared grocery list is not available unless you pay.",0
"Doesn't upload correctly it just gets stuck buffering when trying to open files. When uploading photos, it doesn't allow you to pick multiple photos at once it's super time-consuming and inconvenient.",0
"I was debited and no email was sent to me. Why???? How can I stop you guys from deducting money from my account? I did not authorize the subscription. I just checked out the app and because my payment card is on Google, I was debited. I do not want to be debited again because I am not using the app. How can I subscribe. I am not that busy so won't be needing this app. I need an option to unsubscribe from the app. I would also like a refund as well.",0
"The latest update introduced 'helpful videos' which interrupt what you're doing to play a video you have to WAIT to skip, and that plays audio for all to hear. I could not find a way to turn them off, so if this is how they try and push premium monthly subscriptions, I'm finding a new app.",0
"This is an expensive app. That being said, it's the most low-rent experience you can imagine. For example, when you create a list item and need to edit it, you're completely out of luck because that can't happen. The best you can do is delete it and type it in (again) correctly since edit is not an option. By the way, deleting an item from your list is a multi multi step process. (update: developer noted that editing was possible (though, multiple steps required), item deletes still impossible)",0
"I hate this app because if it is a to do list, it should just be a LIST, not set for a specific time. I already have a calendar for that. You can make a list without times for today, but not for next Thursday. For example, if I want to write a list of things that need to get done at work next Tuesday, I don't want to have to put times on them, but if I tell this app to set it for a certain day, it automatically puts a time and a reminder. I have reminders for things that need reminders already.",0
More of a nuisance than anything. I disabled these stupid moments popups only to have it get in my face in the morning and accidentally delete my tasks trying to close it and get to an important notification. I double checked that it was off and it is yet it keeps popping up. I don't need reminders I didn't set. Also half these paid features are free on iOS this is just taking advantage of people. I hate that.,0
Any app that requires a subscription is and immediate red flag and this on threw up a huge red flag. I don't mind paying a one time fee to remove but I will never subscribe to an annual or monthly service. There are other apps that will perform as well as this one that are either free or a one time fee. Y'all need to get over yourselves and be reasonable on price.,0
"Android 10 recently got pushed to my phone a few weeks ago and ever since then I've had no pop up reminders from the app. Now I need to be using a whole different app for my reminders. I do have a paid version and until a fix comes which hopefully will be in the next few weeks I seem to be paying for an app that doesn't work. Hopefully they can get this resolved quickly as having two apps for my to do list is quite inconvenient. 9/19-Play store shows Aug 25,2019 as the most updated release",0
"I've been using the free version of this app for maybe a year now, and it was pretty useful, but just today I opened up the app to look at my shopping list and I couldn't see my lists because it wanted me to log in to my ""account."" I don't believe I ever made an account for Any.do and I have no interest in making one, so I guess I'm uninstalling it now. Too bad :/",0
"I used to use this app a lot before they changed the interface. The older version was way better and much more efficient and didn't require an email or a premium version. I absolutely hate this app now. It's not user friendly at all! The new interface is complicated to navigate, it messed up my phone, uses a lot of ram! Thanks for screwing up a perfectly simple app. Deleted it and will never download again.",0
"Constant crashing. After reading all the negative reviews, I Uninstalled it from all my devices. **Canceled subscription. App was great, until it crashed. After spending more than a hour setting it up on my Samsung tablet, it will not run. Cannot even get it to start. Too bad. In the past, my experiences have been good with this app. Guess I will see how long it takes to crash on my cell phone. So much for multi-device sync. Such a disappointment. **see above, for new comment added.",0
"But the paid version for a year and never succeeded and getting 3-day reminders to not delete themselves after one or two instances. ""Customer service"" consisted of Microsoft forms level copy-paste ""have you tried reinstalling it?"" advice. Glad Google Calendars has finally assimilated three-quarters of the functionality and I can stop trying to use this app edit: this is the exact type of useless non-answer I'm talking about, like they didn't even read my review.",0
"Keeps failing to repeat some daily tasks. I've had to remake the same tasks several times because they just won't stick for some reason. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's a complete gamble. Now it's more work just to figure out what tasks need done than it is to do the tasks themselves. Uninstalling. This app is more maintenance than my daily chores.",0
"Maybe take calendar out of your name then as it's one of the top results when you search ""calendar"" ZERO STARS! This has to be a joke. This ""calendar"" app only adds the calendars that you already have such as Google calendar. You can unselect those but cannot log into other calendars. They have this connection service to connect to other things but that makes you sign up for another service. How this is editors choice is insane, I assume you paid them off cuz that's the only logical explanation.",0
"This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance. No i don't need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order I entered each item. I do not need an any.do minute.",0
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub.",0
almost all of the events from my other calendar transferred...almost. there was a certain category that didnt transfer resulting in a missed meeting and being late for a presentation. so disappointed I paid for this cause it could potentially be costing me more than just money. glad i caught it when I did and went back to my Google calendar.,0
"It's an ok app, but it's automation is terribly annoying. The widget is awesome, but it I can't add new tasks without pressing a button of sorts. I successfully managed to add a task using Google Assistant, but it added the task to ""someday"" for some reason, as if I got this app to procrastinate as soon as I got it, and the controls on this are unclear. Like how do I make it stop adding tasks to the wrong catagory of time, and have it listed on widget? unclear",0
"$$$ Im being charged a full year up front and not at end of year or monthly as advertised! Great app, and i was hoping to enjoy it. I have been busy so i didnt have time to appreciate the 7 day trial, and that is ok, so i was going to do that during first month in wich should cost me about +-$3.00. But instead i was charged $35.88 right at the end of first week. When i went tovunsubscribe, it said I'd have to keep full year subscription, so there is NO monthly... Messed me up, im NOT rich!",0
"I downloaded the app, tried the free trial, and forgot to cancel in time. I didn't have a use for the app but left it installed because I was paying for it. Even after turning off notifications it would pop up to give me my to do list every day. It would also randomly alert me that items have been added to my shopping list. For not using the app ever, I have a very full shopping list of things I don't want or need. And I didn't click an ad to add it, since I don't even use the app.",0
"This app has consistent issues with syncing. My boyfriend and I used it a few years ago, but stopped using it due to frustrating with all the syncing problems. We tried using it again recently because the app is fantastic otherwise and we wanted to give it another shot. Still our shared lists refuse to sync often enough that the app is more hassel than help. The app is great if you don't need to share lists with another person though.",0
"Great UI/UX but INCREDIBLY buggy, especially with repeating tasks. I'll set a reminder to occur every 2 weeks but when I set that task as complete it'll move the next reminder to 3 weeks from then, then after that 4 weeks from then, and so on. Having to go back and manually change the date each time renders the app useless. Also, $40 for basic features? No thanks. I'm sticking with the default Google calendar reminders.",0
"This app was great until the latest update and the grocery list changed. Now, it's just annoying to use. It takes more steps to get to what I want to do. The app forces a default list to display that I don't use, so I have to navigate back to the home screen to get to the grocery list. I preferred generic Shopping List where I would enter all items. I don't want a different list for each store. The predictive function stinks because you have to clear the field after you add the suggested text.",0
"I really do like this app, but I have horrible problems with it crashing constantly. The stability is AWFUL. Every time I try to check something off a list, it crashes. After every single item. While it's got great structure and is easy to use otherwise, it is the most unstable app I've ever used. Just uninstalled because even updating it didn't stop it from crashing. Fix the damn app; I've submitted enough feedback about it. Highly frustrating and not worth the time.",0
"This app used to be great when paired with Alexa. Every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue. This has not been the case for the past several months. Any.do it is no longer syncing with Alexa and based on the reviews of the Alexa app it is affecting a lot of people, has been ongoing for weeks, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming. Going to give anylist a try to see if it works with Alexa.",0
"What an awful UI. When creating a new reminder, the entire screen is disabled except for the text-entering line. Then you have to go back into the reminder to set options. But some of those options can only be changed via drag and drop, so if you have a lot of reminders, you will be dragging for a long time.",0
"Product images show the month view at the top of the screen with dots, each one represents an event on that particular day. For android, the month view up top just shows the days of the week (no event indicators). Just an empty calendar. At the bottom of the screen there's a chronological list of events. Essentially, what I'm looking at is no more useful than list on a word document. Sure, there's a ton of bells and whistles, but the Android version is almost entirely useless as a calendar.",0
"Love the interface, love the concept. But it lacks several key features on the Android side. The app both web, and the download version have sync issues, to keep your data inline you must keep the Web version up and the if you are using the downloaded app, you must keep it running to keep anything sync. Then you will lose any type of reoccurring tasks.   Love the sub task concept, really slick but if you cannot keep them in sync it does not work very well.   Another item that does not work, though I have requested it is that face that landscape mode is not coded for in all of the app, again in both the web and app version, makes it difficult to use on a tablet if you are switching to a keyboard for example.   So because of syncing issues, missing key landscape issues in several places in the app, lose of data due to syncing issues I had to uninstall the app. Lucky for me I am using 2 or 3 to do list so I have my primary one I am still using, so nothing lost except time. Though I was really hoping this one would pan out.   So though I am marking it as 1 start, I like the concept, and lots of it, but it is buggy,, and needs some serious testing to work out the syncing issues.",0
"No longer usable.Awful Have used this free app for years for grocery and To Do lists. Was simply laid out,easy to use. For years, I created lists I could easily check and uncheck as reminders of what I needed from each store. IDK what happened in the last 6 months, but app has become useless and an exhaustive waste of my time. It completely erases the items I typed in after I have checked and saved the lists, leaving me to waste time to retype things.Have uninstalled/reinstalled. Nothing works.",0
"This was my favorite To Do app, so much so that I purchased the Premium subscription and then notifications stopped working on my phone and desktop.  I tried double checking all the notification settings on my phone, where I want it to work most and everything looks fine.  So I tried to cancel my Premium subscription and it seems impossible.  The instructions to ""manage your subscription settings"" doesn't exist, so I can't get out of the premium subscription.  Their FAQs don't provide accurate instructions.  The desktop app refers you to the manage the subscription setting on your phone which doesn't exist.    I was impressed with this app initially, so my so that I purchased the premium subscription but all the notifications stopped working and I forgot I even had the app at some point until they charged me $26 for the annual subscription, so now I want out but can't get out.",0
"Very annoyed that I have to keep signing in and then it deleted all my lists. Ive been working on a master shopping list for several months. Im trying to track what my regular purchases so that I could have just opened an app such as this, gone down my list, and checked off what I needed. But when I logged back in AGAIN, my shopping lists were gone for the third time. When it works, its great. It just doesnt work enough and I dont have time for this.",0
"I have had this app for almost a year. I was really enjoying it. I mostly used it for my grocery list and weekend to do list. However, I will be uninstalling it now because it deemed it appropriate to automatically add ""Welch's brand Fruit Snacks!"" to my grocery list without permission. I encounter ads in a lot of places, but I refuse to use an app that panders to corporations in such a way that it starts adding branded products to my damn grocery list.",0
"Wunderlist was everything I needed and I had no issues with the app. This ""replacement"" tried to keep a somewhat similar format, but replaced the things that I really enjoyed from the original app. I don't like having a list app connected to Google or the rest of my accounts. I just wanted something simple that I could easily share with my family. I'm really disappointed with this forced move to a new app. Can't Wunderlist be allowed to continue to function?!",0
Smart Grocery List From Hell. While it might be handy to sort your list by catagory. Now everything is spread out all over the place. I wanted to turn the feature back off and it will not turn off. I like to sort things in the order I travel through the store. i know where everything I purchase is located. Well can't do that any.more. Having to change the category on each item i buy to Esential household item so that i can keep everything together. what a drag!,0
"This app is deceivingly terrible. There are some really nice design features like the home screen widget. All of this nice user experience is trashed by the ""POP UNDER"" that doesn't turn off. Every day, it's there waiting for you when you turn on your phone. I have all alerts in app turned off, my phone blocks app notifications, and I'm on Do Not Disturb and yet, there is this annoying feature that Any.do won't allow you to disable. EDIT: I DISABLED MOMENT NOTIFICATIONS A PRIOR TO DEV COMMENT",0
"Terrible Update! This app used to be perfect for planning out when certain tasks were to be completed. The interface was easy to understand and you could see and plan as many days into the future as you wanted, and everything was perfectly broken down by date. Now when you add tasks, regardless of when they need to be completed, the app just says to do it today. It has completely eliminated the only use for this app, which was to make out a planned future.",0
"Why does every once in a while... out of the blue, the app asks to update acct emails or such and then everything on my task list has been lost??? This last time, my list went back to some list I had quite awhile back... must have been the list I lost at another time. This is quite frustrating. And if I have to spend the time to make a new list, I cld just as well spend that time finding another app to use. Especially since this seems to be reoccurring. So disappointing.",0
"Instead of shopping around, I downloaded Any.do because of how widely used it is. Setting up one day's schedule should have taken me just a couple of minutes. But the app seemingly randomized which day of the week an entry was for. On two occasions, it picked a day over a year away. After twenty minutes of fighting the app, I finally had my schedule together. I spent another ten minutes trying to get any notifications to work, with no luck. Fortunately, uninstalling only took a few seconds.",0
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on.",0
"Almost perfect but the developers choose to ignore one very important thing. There are several people posting the same request. Keep the popups but stop them from interrupting other apps, which can be crucial at times. The forum posts I saw requesting this were old so it's obviously not a problem you're willing or able to fix. Otherwise I might have bought the full version but I had to uninstall",0
"Not working on Samsung watch6 Installed due to wanting tasks listed on new Samsung watch6. All OK on phone. On watch only thing that comes up is add a task, no list of tasks. Tasks added on watch show on phone but not vice versa.",0
"As a programmer, this is absolutely the most lazily put together trash that I've ever come across. The basic version of this app is only meant to accomplish the simplest of tasks, but it abhorrently fails to do so. As a user, I'm appalled. My task lists were constantly being manipulated without any input on my end; I'm talking added information, reordering of items in my list, and even complete deletion of subtasks. Do not trust this app with anything of even the slightest importance.",0
The current notification sounds each of which lasts for a couple of seconds makes the app useless. How can the developer fail to realize that the very idea of a reminder is make sure that the user is reminded. There is an excellent app on this store which is perfect in this regard. I don't want to name it but the developer has to find it and learn how reminders should be. I. Have uninstalled this app after 10 minutes of trial.,0
After a task is done a duplicate will appear for the same task causing me to have to remove one. Then even if I haven't done a task that day it will still have one of them marked done (the duplicate is always unmarked). I believe this is due to an error in the day tracking it. It seems to be unable to tell whether or not the day is ended. It's rather unfortunate considering it is very easy to personalize and even allows you to create a grocery list. Uninstalled and will not be reinstalling :/,0
"Ugh! After years of using this app, I am so very tired of the reminders not syncing across all my media! I get notifications for the same task on my chromebook, cellphone and tablet; I have to dismiss on all three! Now that Google Tasks has reminders (and syncs across all media devices), I can create lists, AND it's free, I will probably kiss Any.do goodbye. UPDATE: Contacted Team and they confirmed sync problem, and at this time don't have a solution üôÑ",0
"Wanted to use this with my Android phone and my Alexa show. ""Zapier"" sync Only available for a monthly fee. Really disappointing. Was hoping this would be the answer. my Alexa list shows up separately from my any do list, which would show up separately from my Google list. so it's kind of useless I want everything to sync into one list! as I would have then used it to sync to an iPhone so our family could connect and have one list kind of stupid if I have to search through a bunch of lists.",0
"This app has an appealing interface but the only problem with it is IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK. If you want to use it for anything other than a list of things to do. It doesn't sync. It loses your data. It basically wastes your time rather than saving you time. Customer service is a joke. It's useless too. Very nice, but utterly useless. The idea that you can have assistance and delegate tasks is basically a lie because it's not available in my area and I live in Los Angeles.",0
"Started a free trial to premium without my permission, can't take it off. Im not going to pay for it so I don't want it there so that I don't use premium features on accident and get used to them. Tried to delete account to start over and do differently but every time I type in the password to delete the account I get an error message. Waste of time. Going to use a different app.",0
"Works decently most of the time, but I've noticed that any of the reminders I have long time (things that are supposed to remind me every day indefinitely) eventually just stop reminding me, even though they still show up on my to do list. Very frustrating. The inconsistencies make this unreliable, which essentially makes the app useless to me as a tool to plan my day around",0
"What happened?? I have this app installed on my phone and it works beautifully as a calendar. Bought a new phone and the Cal app is now a full planner and to-do list.

EDIT--""Minimalist"" does not describe this app. Certainly not compared to what you used to offer.",0
"So many options I would like to try..but i am discouraged by the fact that I cant even change tne color theme for free. There is no explanation of the Focus mode in the app, and the last time I did a trial with google I was charged for the ""free"" trial. Every dollar counts especially now, and incurring another monrhly bill just for recurring tasks and to go from blue to mauve for a theme is just unnecrssary. My search continues, and i hope the devs are reading the 1 star reviews thoroughly.",0
Edited to 1 star. It is fine for personal lists but you cannot share them with others. When you look up 'how to' any.do claims you can do this with a free account and even shows you how... With a function that does not exist in either of our apps. The only option available is exporting it in a clunky text list- no in app shared lists. Uninstalling and re installing did not update. Gonna switch I think.,0
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!,0
I had a premium. Scam.The app is very pushy and annoying. I couldn't get into 80% of my incoming calls as it blocked the screen so the call doesn't appear on the screen. You only hear it and hopelessly looking for the call screen that you only get once the call is dropped. You have to call back then. Disturbing and annoying. I barely used this app as to maintain it takes a lot of time. I asked them to cancel they said they will not refund as more than 48h passed of yearly(!) subscription.,0
It looked good but it doesn't work. I scheduled simple tasks and it would change the timing. I re corrected to make it right several times. The navigation was difficult. Like I'd want to set a task but then I'd have to say the task was complete so wouldn't be sure it saved. Couldn't just back out to see the task was set correctly. Had to confirm the task was done then undo the task for later which might then change the time to something I never set. üò≥,0
"Redoing my review after messaging with the app for a while. Basically everything I need to do is either not there or you have to pay a monthly subscription to do it. Not worth it to think you're getting somewhere with the app finally, only to have the ""upgrade to premium"" page keep popping up when you try to do the only useful things in the app. S'a shame. The widget looked nice.",0
"I used to love this app, but recently they did a big push for premium. At the same time, I started having a huge issue with my lists not opening. The screen shows, but it is grayed out and I can't click on anything. I tried the premium to see if that would help, but it hasn't. My lists are inaccessible to me. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app to noavail.",0
"There's an issue where the bottom pop up notifications do not display in Android 10. Which is my entire reason for using this app and why I paid for a year. I understand bugs happen but I'm losing the value I paid, for a reminder app that doesn't remind me... I reached out to support, they said a fix is coming in a few weeks. I asked to have my subscription extended for the loss of use, so far no resolution. I'll give 5 stars once my money doesn't feel wasted. Thanks",0
"Don't use this app!! Any.do charged by credit card $29.99 without my permission, for a premium plan, after I'd used the free plan for quite a while. When questioned, their support team said that it was an automatic feature. Then told me that the only way to turn off this ""automatic"" feature was to use an app downloaded to my desktop. I only use the app on my phone and never on a desktop. They did also say that deleting this app from my phone will not cancel the automatic payment!!! Unbelievable!",0
"I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model",0
"This keeps crashing, freezing, not responding. If I choose to wait, it eventually moves forward, but takes so long that it is useless. I tried restarting the app, restarting my tablet, futzing with settings, sending a report... nothing has helped. I uninstalled and re-installed the app, and it is still freezing/not responding and asking me if I'd like to quit it.",0
"Cant skip a task... So Tick Tick isn't going to let us deal with failure in a healthy manner? Which is to accept and acknowledge over tasking yourself, and try to do better next time? I use this app to put in thing like weekly chores. Sometimes I just don't have enough time to get around to all of the recurring tasks I set. It is unbelievably fricken annoying to not have a skip for those instances. Especially since half the time I delete every occurrence just trying to get my inbox neat.",0
"Was already thinking of removing the app due to its bad performance and draining the battery. Now that I lost all my tasks with the last update, this choice became very easy.",0
"My wife and I have used this app for years and now all of a sudden we have to pay 10 dollars a month to share grocery lists with each other. There is a dark place where you can stick that. Bye. ETA: the developer added a new shared grocery list and some other features. Okay, but you took away the ability to share a list between people unless you pay. So gtfo with that. Again, Bye üëã",0
They have debited a yearly subscription but within 15 days my premium subscription is canceled. Premium features are not able to use. My debited amount is gone not even recredited in my account . They are cheating us . Don't subscribe it . It's a scam.,0

Just awful,0
Its not installing at my device??,0
Geezuss... Garbage. Id rather use MS List one hand on a Mac.,0
Pay to use the AI. Nope not for me. There are similar apps that are actually much better than this one with more AI features and a better interface and completely free of charge. Uninstalled for good.,0
Great,0
"I want to try, to complicated and hit seems to that I have to pay before i try. Buy and try. There are Other alternatives.",0
Doesn't appear you can sync tasks with Outlook or Google and they only offer support for paid version. Useless to me.,0
Not user-friendly.,0
Does not have anonymous mode,0
Stopped working,0
"Was good up until the new update. Now when I add reminders for today, they sometimes set for a few days from now. Which means I have to go back and change the date. I hope they fix it soon and make it run as well as it did before the update. For now, I'm giving it 1 star until it's fixed.",0
Doesn't work Create account Enter name Password Go Oops! Please try again later,0
"video ads now shown at home page, takes too long to skip",0
shuts down on the Samsung S24 Ultra,0
from best to worse now this app is no good because it has started running apps in the world of uninstalling right now before this update my rating was 5 star,0
"Pay to get suggestions from AI? of course not. I already have like 10 AI based apps and thank goodness i don't need to pay a plan for a silly ""to-do"" app. Bye!",0
Not adequately disclosed that shared functions with teams or family are paid functions. Need more transparency in their product.,0
I found the interface a bit messy and not intuitive. Free version doesn't allow any customisation or to add notes and wishlists. Never would i buy the premium version.,0
TRASH. If all the features are premium. Then present it as a paid app!!,0
"there is no option to copy and paste repeating task. you have to manually do it, its a bit tedious. not recommended",0
not free,0
send me money,0
"For the custom alarm reminder for tasks, there is no way to change the time from AM to PM.",0
This app billed a payment on me without my consent. F u,0
I have no idea but try to them and I tell you idea,0
I never leave reviews but this was a terrible experience. The ads play super loud EVERY TIME I open this app!!!!,0
I was bombarded with features I dont have if I did not pay. It discougred me to use the app.,0
"Truly worthless app, i lost all my tasks , search is garbage",0
"Was good. Then you upgrade to premium for $36 just to keep the free features, then they take away more features and make you pay more just to keep the premium features. Now you need to get the family workspace to share lists with your family for $100. Give me a break. Back to pad and paper or an app for a reasonable price. Anydo you suck!",0
Integration requires paid third service Zapier. No native integration possible :(,0
"I'd give zero if I could. $36 for what used to be free, then $8+ more PER MONTH to share lists (used to be FREE). And no, I WON'T waste time reaching out to customer care. I'm just deleting this garbage.",0
Everything was good,0
It's not intuitive. I can't figure out how to add subtasks.,0
"You really have to improve the app to match the standards and functionality of your desktop version, which is brilliant !!! (I am using the paid version). Very frustrating not being able to seamlessly switch between devices. As if it's two completely different platforms ‚òπÔ∏è",0
"From last few days, I have observed that if I add some task to remind me, it dose not remind me. No alarm, no call, nothing. Then what I'm paying for?",0
I can't delete my account and the app force to me have to pay premium fee. I can't cancel subscription and the application has received its annual membership fee.,0
Great product but monthly subscription is asking too much!,0
widgets is very bad,0
Black event font required in Calendar View!,0
Don't like the update,0
"EDIT: The Anydo subscription isn't listed in the Subscription menu It's a good app but I've been subscribed to free premium trial automatically, with no way to cancel. I'm also unable to delete my account as it says Wrong Password, when I entered the right one after several password resets.",0
I have observed and I could be wrong that whenever we add our phone number to be called in this app that person automatically gets multiple spam messages selling them credit card. Is that possible.,0
It signed me up for a 7 day free trial even though I specifically skipped that step. This is unacceptable. I uninstalled it.,0
"After new update, a lot of bugs....while moving a task to a new position in the list, the task gets automatically selected...that task will be shown in white colour whenever i scroll the rest of the list....also sometimes these tasks gets automatically completed and removed from the list without me noticing it",0
"Was my ""go to"" for notes and reminders. Now it has pop overs that will not go away. No setting in app or device stops the pop over. MB eed to exit app and start over. Looking for a replacement that is less annoying.",0
"UPDATE: I appreciate the developers reaching out after seeing my review, but I think the issue is pretty self explanatory. I don't have the time to go back and forth with the team to trouble-shoot this simple issue. Just fix the bug or patch with an update. FIRST REVIEW: I enjoyed the new ""My Day"" feature only twice because it never worked again after that. The app can't load any of the tasks for me to schedule ""My Day"". What a shame since it's alot more useful than ""Moment""",0
Very disappointed. Spent a lot of time entering in daily tasks to the calendar and when I was finished I clicked on the calendar and the app crashes and closes. Got the message that there is a bug in the app and to clear the cache. This app is a waste of my time which is ridiculous since the whole premise of the app is to help organize your time....ughhh...Uninstallimg app.,0
"Can't create an account, ""Oops something went wrong"" when using any Proton mail address. Literally unusable.",0
Please test the app and refine the user flows. The user experience is terrible. Management must be subpar. Nothing feels coherent. Styles are mixed and matched everywhere. Users need to press 3 different buttons moving around different lists to even locate the settings page. Hire competent designers or continue to lose more users and sales.,0
I wanted the refund but I still needed to use the app! Why did you take away all of the features with the refund? Now all my repeating tasks don't repeat!!!,0

"Had this for quite a while now, and discovered that my daily reminder just packs up after about 3-4 days and reminders just stop. I reset the daily reminders, same thing happens again. Thing is, it's irritated me that much that now I remember the daily task because I remember that the app will likely forget about it, so I actually don't need the app any more.

Stopped receiving notifications on Android 14,0
"I was debited and no email was sent to me. Why???? How can I stop you guys from deducting money from my account? I did not authorize the subscription. I just checked out the app and because my payment card is on Google, I was debited. I do not want to be debited again because I am not using the app. How can I subscribe.

it isn't free,0
"The latest update introduced 'helpful videos' which interrupt what you're doing to play a video you have to WAIT to skip, and that plays audio for all to hear. I could not find a way to turn them off, so if this is how they try and push premium monthly subscriptions, I'm finding a new app.",0

one star due to developer claiming have focus mode and only thing the blog said was defininign focus mode. i clearly stated this app doesn't have a focus timer in either paid or free version. which is why i installed focus app who is a to do list with pomodoro timer. DO NOT REPLY TO THIS REVIEW THIS STATEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING AND ANY REPLY WILL BE CONSIDERED HARASSMENT AND I WILL AND DO FILE CHARGES AS I HAVE OTHER DEVELOPERS. BE AN HONEST DEVELOPER AND DON'T LIE ONLY GREEDY DEVELOPER LIE.,0
They added full screen video ads that require you to wait 5 seconds to close. Nope.,0
Moved features that have been free for years into a new premium version. Will be uninstalling. Disappointing.,0
uhhgg,0
Disgusting way of pushing adds. Disgraceful,0
No caldav,0
aaking for premium and reviews,0

Worth nothing.,0
"It's free without ads, and it looks nice. But it does ask to subscribe to premium a bit obtrusively, and the overall feature set is too complex.",0
"This app is good for non technical people, but they introduce many major design changes and it's not at all customisable. So I developed an html js page, used the browser storage, and auto-download the data (json) as per some conditions. I have another app that syncs my downloads with my Google drive so that takes care of backup. I have customised that page to my needs and have been much happier person now :)",0
Kom. Kom,0
Cancelled the free trial ahead or time and still for charged. I sent a bunch of emails To get refunded and no one ever for back To me.,0
makes it hard to unsubscribe,0
"It is not fair to say this app is free. It is free to download if you never plan to do anything with it. The ""in-app purchases"" are a subscription that is mandatory to pay after the 2 week trial period.",0
"If all it is is ""pretty"".......than no thanks.",0
I think it may be good but you are so greedy to ask for money hope you all bad luck and failure as you disappointed me üò†,0
You took money from my account for an application I used just once. I will go to authorities for this sht you did,0
Cancel it kept saying wrong password even if it wasn't. Wish I had my 2 hours back,0
Not worth paying for and you can't use it unless you pay for it. Don't waste your money or time.,0
You have to PAY... to take notes ?!!! Awful.,0
"CC Required To Use. Cannot even preview with limited features or ads? Not cool. I see you say this is so service isn't interrupted. That's what reminder notifications are sent for. If I like it, trust me, I'll pay for it. Looking for other app that doesn't require this.",0
"A ""free app"" requiring a credit card to start? I don't mind paying up front for a good app but please be honest about the cost up front. Deleted before completing login on principle.",0
I can't even try a a watered down version of the app. I have to automatically sign up for the membership. It is not give you any sampling whatsoever. You cannot go past signing up for the membership,0
This app does not have a free version. It only has a subscription version. I'm not interested to give my payment details for the 2 weeks free trial. It would have been better if there was a free version but with limited features like many other planner apps.,0
I signed in with google and was kinda excited to use this app but then i saw i needed a subscription so I tried to delete my account but I saw it needed a password and i dont know my password,0
Rediculous for charging money. And it is not cheap,0
am not paying for a agenda,0
Would like to actually try the product first during the trial instead of being forced to pay first before trying.,0
"No alarms for tasks. The widgets only show calender items(google already has this feature), not tasks. The stickers are garish and there is no option to upload your own art for the cover!

Wouldnot open for me,0
"Didn't realize it was a ""pay after 2 weeks free""app. (That's on me for not reading). I'll stick to a paper calendar,much cheaper and still reliable. Dissappinted though.

"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good.",0
You create a Google account with this before you find out you need to pay monthly for this. Since it has access to my callender and private info.. hopefully I can get my account deleted. Please let your users know you have to pay before using in big bold letters! Thx!,0
"My phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what I do. It keep showing it was blocked, troubleshoot, and refresh background task.",0
Useless without pro.,0
Reminders should not be transfered in event section. It was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly.,0
How to use this app? ü§î Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.,0
"I would love this app only if the notifications work at all. There were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my Oppo F5. I tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times, yet nothing worked. Would give 5 if I do not have this issue.",0
"Fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore, it's just blank. I've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank.",0
"I've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential. It has a simple UI but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work. I purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work. But I can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles (if it's even possible), starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends",0
I can't believe you have to make PAYMENTS on an app! Ridiculous.,0
Owes me a refund and and won't give it. I never used it and canceled before trail ended.,0
I like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring ......in the system I allowed everything I needed too but still it's not working out,0
Won't let you try without giving a credit card...,0
"I would love to try the app, but It requires a subscription to even try it or look around it. I hate having to unsubscribe in 2 weeks if I don't like it, because Lord knows my ADHD mind has done moved on. Let me look around, and if I want to keep using it, then make me sign up for it.",0

I'm looking for a free app. No shade that y'all want $$$ however no where in the info says I gotta buy the service to use the app. And no, I'm not interested in a free trial. Edited to add that the replies I'm seeing left by this company are snarky as all hell. Even if I was looking to pay, seeing the unprofesh responses would deter me to another app.",0
Took money and I never used app... Refund,0
not what i expected from seeing pics posted in the description.,0
I'm looking to save time and I have to dig in the info to find where it's says you want money. Put that upfront so I don't waste my time installing and uninstalling. I make time to complain about it,0
Doesn't even work. I tried adding events and it didn't work,0
It's not a free app. Two weeks trial and then yearly subscription of 35 bucks or something. I just wanted a new calendar app because I don't like Google.,0
Must be used after purchase,0
The app worked great - until I actually purchased it ü§î Go figure,0
Cannot register,0
No free trial! As soon as you open the app it says you need to sign up and you'll get 2 weeks free then $35/ yr will be charged. I was going to try it but it immediately charged my account with no free trial. I was not happy. I have requested a refund and will not be looking at this again.,0
Should put in description that it's a paid app.,0
"I wanted to love this app, but it is so frustrating that every time I set a specific time for an appointment for example (physical therapy @ 3pm) it shows in my calendar an hour earlier & specifically lists it at 2pm. I've tried this a million times & no matter what the appointment shows in day mode as the correct time, but as an hour earlier in the monthly calendar mode. If I want to see the correct time in my calendar I have to enter it an hour later. So this makes the app completely unusable",0
There's a trial period involved and then you have to pay,0
"I hoped it would be good, but unfortunately, the only way to use itis to pay. When you open it, you're brought to a register page where you can start a 14-day trial. There does not seem to be a free option. I understand the need to make money from this, but it would be nice to have a free with ads version or something. Not everyone has the capability to pay for an app, and I bet this would definitely reach more people if it wasn't pay only. Disappointed.",0
"App froze on START screen. I couldn't even get it to do anything past it wanting to sync across all my devices which I don't HAVE an icloud and didn't want it on my Microsoft and there was no way to exit out of the screen when it froze there. Also: BE UPFRONT WITH THE COST BEFORE DOWNLOADING. I wouldn't have even bothered to download in the first place if it showed how much cost, and it doesn't even do that until AFTER you make an account with their app, which I'm sure will send SPAM.",0
Paid app,0
"Pretend it's free but it's only a free trial.. I thought false advertising was illegal.. Devs are clearly unapologetic about this false advertising, which leads to consumers wondering what *else is being hidden in the code of this app. Without a completely free base version, devs are losing out on SO MUCH POTENTIAL. Such a focus on pay-to-play shows that they definitely do NOT value their customers, and being unwilling to offer a basic free version shows they wont listen to their consumer base",0
Never really used this app.,0
False Advertising. Said in app purchases but you have to pay to even use the minimal. Disappointed.,0
Not working notification.,0
I'm poor. Its 34$....tf?,0
I thought it was free to use but I have to pay for it I not going to pay for it so I deleted it,0
"Unable to add screenshots to tasks, links or sub tasks - like a list under To Dos. Clunky. I deleted it within the hour because there's no way this calendar would help me keep track of my daily tasks etc.. This is for a less busy person.",0
I cancelled the subscription. But they keep charging the CC. Be aware.,0
"What I don't understand is that you have to pay for it. It's kind of unreasonable, and I'm just looking for a digital planner app that you don't have to pay for and works for Chromebooks/laptops. I've tried two other apps, and those don't work either. At this point, I should just buy a paper planner.",0
The cost is ridiculous,0
Why don't you have a free version like other planners do?,0
"This app is incredibly glitchy. Events save under the wrong date and time, which literally makes the entire app unreliable and useless.",0
"App is not free, there is a trial but other than that you have to buy it to keep it.",0
Only use if you pay. The second I download it wanted me to pay for a subscription. I couldn't x out if it or anything without putting my credit card information. Disappointing,0
"Under description, the first sentence should be ""2 week free trial, but we do not offer a free version"". It's sad that you have to give out personal information just to get a 2-week free trial. It's not guaranteed that we would love this.",0
How what n where did this COME FROM HUH GOOGLE DEVELOPERS I DONT PLAY KIDS GAMES IM A BUISNESS LADY WORK IS ALL I DO,0
Such a pain to use. Too wonky. Needs work,0
Costs money,0
"Not free, I mean anything is not free",0
Download the app and filled everything out and then tried to start my subscription but it kept giving me an error even though I know that the credit card that I was using is feet completely fine. Guess I won't get to try this one after all,0
I'm sorry but a monthly subscription to use a calendar? That's ridiculous. I'd rather have ads or just buy the app outright; paying monthly for a planner is the biggest scam I've ever seen.,0
Must put credit card info in to get trial NOPE,0
Don't like that you do not tell price or allow to try before starting the trial period.,0
"Edit: I have NOT received a refund. Canceling their subscription requires to jump through hoops. Don't expect to just log-in and cancel. I sent a message with Hey after sending others with info in which I got 0 replies. Yet you only focus on hey, your response proves the lack of care. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED ‚ö†Ô∏è This app doesn't let you cancel and won't let you log in after you have made an account with the subscription you just made. Customer Service is awful. Skip this one entirely. Very scam-y.",0
"It's not actually free. They will tell you there's no secrets because they say you have to subscribe in the description, but they know what they're doing. Also, if you can say ""Plan in Style!"" In your name you can put ""Subscription Planner"" instead. Maybe people won't leave you bad reviews for being misleading.",0
"Very good app, but it would be perfect if the app actually didn't shut down and not give me notifications. PLEASE FIX THIS",0
Not so usefull,0
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?",0
"Very nice app but 1 important functionality is missing...There is no option to mark the task as completed. If task is not completed, then there is should be a option to reschedule it to another day or let it expire. Further its agreed that it is not a to do app, but if something doesn't go as per plan, we should be aware that the particular task is not yet completed and depending upon it we may decide to reschedule it or let it expire",0
"I want to like this app, but there is so much wrong with it. For example: even though I'm clearing my days to start fresh after having applied templates, every day is still populated. So any day I input anything, it will overlap and I'll have to go in and delete every individual event. Don't like that you can't schedule anything overnight. There also seems to be a lot of bugs in it, so at this point, it might just be easier to do all of this in Samsung Calendar instead.",0
It is good app but is not tuning/alarming even i setted notifications option in blogs tell me how can i correct this issue,0
"It's been nearly a year since I downloaded this app, and it's still clunky and hard to use. Blocks still don't have the option to appear on the calendar. You still can't organise the blocks by different orders, eg. 'Sort by date descending/ascending' I have to scroll through months of blocks to get to the most recent. There's still no 'home screen' to see all commitments. I thought I'd downloaded in early stages and it was just going to get better, but it seems this app is stagnant.",0
Used to be great,0
Confusing to use,0
I stopped receiving notifications after an update of the app,0
"so far, so good.",0
Every time I schedule something using the templates it makes duplicates. One change to the schedule throws off all other entries and everything overlaps. Most additions to my schedule cause me to have to alter the entire schedule just to make them fit and not just show them overlapping or double populated on the schedule. Why is there a learning curve for a scheduling app? Idk either. It should just work when you make entries.,0
Work ok but no watch app,0
"Has potential and seems reasonably thought out in terms of intuitiveness for the user. However, it bugged horribly at me in the most basic thing you could ask of it: assigning a template to multiple days. Specifically, it doubled all of the tasks in all of the days assigned the template and removed the task titles. That pretty much made the app useless to me.",0
nice,0
I rate it 2 Star because it's been four days now I am using this app first 2 days it always notify me perfectly but today it didn't notify me at all I restart my phone check the setting I check everything but still it's not notify me at all please update the app or it's just became useless and I have to uninstall it but still I wait this month for the update,0
This is a very bad app I wrote it perfectly the first day all the other days time laps time laps time laps WHY I CAN'T GO TO 7 YEARS JUST TO FIX TIME LAPS,0
Almost perfect...but one huge flaw. Can't sync between multiple devices. I need something that I can use on my phone for notification but on my tablet or computer for planning.,0
I'm not being rude but it was really hard to use it had no step by step guide and I had to learn myself it was really hard creating a day schelde,0
I really need the what you can say really annoying sound when the block is finished,0
Very complicated to use.,0
Has a lot of potential but lacking really simple features like being able to drag a block within schedule (as you can in template),0
good application,0
faltu app hai,0
"There one problem I have with the app though I love every other thing about and it is that once I spend sometime outside the app it doesn't notify me about schedules until I open it again. I've allowed the app every permission it's asked, but it's still the same.",0
"Pretty good, notifications don't work however.",0
"More update should be required like week planer, event planer, todo list",0
I'm not able to download this app and I hv lot of space I'm not understanding the problem,0
Has potential but made no sense I didn't know what the hell I was doing needs more explanation and help,0
"Way too many taps required to add an entry, in my opinion. Streamline the process...",0
"it is unstable with time in my Android phone , i.e it doesn't goes with time to time in order you should enter to the app so its become upto time",0
"I find a better called structured app and prosper.Kindly improve your or perish.Im not rude, but I am informing you how time blocking apps should work.Kindly give the users a better app experience.I would like to give my humble opnion before deleting your app.",0
Broken App. It keeps doubling up items in the schedule every day. Clearing doesn't work. Applying a blank template doesn't work. I can't manually delete them because it repeats for every single day. Furthermore - if I do manually delete them for a day then apply a template - they double up again.,0
Not great I have this for almost a year. It is great for arrangement but functionality sucks. Its alarms ring always a few minutes after the start time. Today i tried to change the ringtune but it is still playing old tune. Android kills this app sometimes and it doesnt recover. It doesnt auto start for me when you restart you phone or close open apps. Going to look for better app now.,0
"Two star just because of not adding the Task add option or project as other. The developer should alter this app. Look at the apps such as Timenoder, todos and planner apps",0
I want subscribe the app but it errors,0
Not what I need. Lacks managing individual tasks,0
There is a permanent banner ad about upgrading. It's very distracting.,0
App is quite good but the Problem is that even if I select the play sound option it only shows a window popup the play sound option doesn't work for my device and without it I am unable to figure out what to do,0
"I used to use it, but found a better app that allowed me to properly use my back up, so I took a break. Then, after I came back to see if the bug was fixed, but now a new bug of not working properly even though it's been paid for.",0
Hard to understand,0
Not forcing enough,0
No any good features,0
Older version was much better.,0
Membership required,0
"More update should be required like week planer, event planer, todo list",0
Very difficult to get fimilier with user interface.. second there should some template to edit .. starting from all over making daily routine is a bit hactic to do ..,0
"If app was available in a web browser format, It would definitely have five stars from me",0
Its great and all but I bought the pro version n got my receipt but I'm still stuck with the normal version. I've tried reinstalling but nothing works. Please reply this and tell me how I can get pro version. I hav proof of my payment too,0
Cannot organise the run time,0
"Notification not working, useless just throwing background issue error",0
Bad,0
Not responsive and app freezes,0
"Well, The app interface itself is quite confusing. The interface should be more simple & easy to understand.",0
"Pretty good, notifications don't work however.",0
I Just Download it,0
Not user friendly,0
Why is break tag forcefully added in all activities? Why can't I remove it? Why deleting tags delete the whole activity? Edit - I don't think you quite understood the problem. I cannot change or remove the 'break' tag. Even in work activities it forces the break tag and I cannot replace it. Plus if an activity has 3 tags and one of them gets removed doesn't mean you'll remove the whole activity.,0
Felt complicated app to set up,0
"This app is really good for people, especially students who are busy with their schedules.. However since the last update in Feb 2020. I can't make new schedule. The 'OK' or 'DONE' button was gone.",0
The app is always blocked by the system even I allow all the permission of this app. I cant hear or see any notifications even I fixed all the settings both of the app and my phone,0
I am too much confuse to use this app kindly help me please,0
Latest update sucks.,0
"Great app but the notification ringtone doesn't work, which is really important for me. Hope you add a calendar feature for the week at least.",0
Crashes at start.,0
"Redesigned dialogs are broken: 1) ""Import day from"" dialog on routine edit screen ‚Äì no ""Monday"" & ""Tuesday"" in the day list (spinner) 2) ""+ Notification"" dialog on routine edit screen ‚Äì no ""Play voice"" checkbox (Please tell me if there's a better way to report bugs like this)",0
"Unfortunately, the notifications does not work I did all you mentioned and still the problem exists, The bell thingy on blocks is desipeared.",0
I've installed it...but..... HUAWEII blocked this useful app in my phone üòì,0
"App is really good..! But, after giving all possible permissions for the app to run in background also, I'm not getting any notifications..!",0
"really messy if it comes to choosing days. instead of day 1 day 2... it should use monday, tuesday edit: i had a new version and the problem with the naming is that it makes it confusing so I ended up trying several options to get the temple start at the right day",0
"It was a really good app for keeping a log of everything you had done throughout the day, until I realized you could literally do nothing with the data. There are no export or report generating features of any kind.",0
You really should not make the sync ability a premium functionality since there is no one who is willing to set each of their calendars one by one again just for try a new schedule app.,0
"My goodness the latest update is the worst experience. I've used this app since 2019 and it used to be great. Now? Overlapping scedules, more than 24 hours in a day (why are u guys using day 1,2,3 anyways such a hassle). I prefer back then when u used to organize the routines by days in the week rather day 1,2,3. It is really difficult to organise and sync. And don't you tell me to send email to customer help cause I did. But the response was meh. Bye TT. I guess our long relationship has to end",0
So far I am confused. I downloaded after all the reviews seemed high. I entered an event and had to do so twice and it still is not showing. Where is there a tutorial on how to add events and the like? The only thing I could do is to change the event icon and color or add one. I AM SO LOST.,0
"This app was DEFINITELY better before the update. The ""add time to previous activity"" feature was great! But it's not in the app anymore. And another good feature is gone too! Seriously would've given this a five star rating if the update didn't take place. I have been using this for year's now. Very disappointed with the new update.",0
"I dream this will become my favorite app in the future, but right now, it's more toilsome even than just using pen and paper. All start and end times must be entered manually. There's no drag and drop, no moving blocks around, no changing their lenght, no duplicating them easily, no default block lenghts, no autoschedule. If you have to make just one little change to your plan, it's easier to just scrap the whole day and start anew.",0
"This needs trial period! I'm currently looking for an app that allows me to plan my day to the minute, that gives notifications when i want, and that is easy and intuitive to use. At first glance this app seems to provide me with everything i want.. However all those features seem to be locked behind a paywall. Now i am fully willing to pay for an app that does what i want it to, but i do want to be assured of that. In other words, it needs to feature a trial period for the premium version.",0
I wish they would bring drag-and-drop back. Using the up-down arrows to rearrange items is a pain.,0
App shows start time in notification but does not show in end time. Please app improve.,0
It's all great until schedule blocks start deleting themselves randomly :(,0
I'm not able to download this app and I hv lot of space I'm not understanding the problem,0
I uninstalled the app after the new update. It was confusing and I couldn't set my routines properly.,0
New update sucks. Poor UI,0
Latest update causing the app crash consistently. Reinstalled a number of time but no change. Sad.,0
Edit: They turned off my schedule so they could tell me the new update has more ads now.,0
"I can't edit the alarm so that it doesnt repeat, gets really really annoying as I have to stop the timer interrupting my work",0
Very confusing while organizing,0
Please add custom repeat options. E.g. repeat every 4 days,0
It asked may too many questions,0
The app is not free. There is no free version. Wasted my time giving them my personal information to find out I also have to give them my credit card details just to even try the app out at all. Don't bother.,0
Too pricey. Don't use.,0
"I hoped it would be good, but unfortunately, the only way to use itis to pay. When you open it, you're brought to a register page where you can start a 14-day trial. There does not seem to be a free option. I understand the need to make money from this, but it would be nice to have a free with ads version or something. Not everyone has the capability to pay for an app, and I bet this would definitely reach more people if it wasn't pay only. Disappointed.",0
"I've been looking for an app just like this forever. I had this one for about two minutes. You can't even take a look at the interface without entering your paymnt information. I think the subscription ($50 annually) wold be outside of my price range anyways, but I'm disappointed that I couldn't mess around for a few days to see how I like it. I would be interested to see a free or more affordable version of this app. I love the idea but on a student budget, this just doesn't work for me.",0
"Not worth looking at, honestly. Even after subscribing, it won't open past the ""subscribe"" page. Won't show a calendar, won't sync with anything. Literally, it does nothing. Don't bother with it. I had such high hopes, given how many people rave about it, but it's a big disappointment. Edited to add: yes, I did reach out to customer service with a help ticket. It was ignored. Be aware that no matter how long you wait for help, the 2 week free trial won't extend.",0
"App froze on START screen. I couldn't even get it to do anything past it wanting to sync across all my devices which I don't HAVE an icloud and didn't want it on my Microsoft and there was no way to exit out of the screen when it froze there. Also: BE UPFRONT WITH THE COST BEFORE DOWNLOADING. I wouldn't have even bothered to download in the first place if it showed how much cost, and it doesn't even do that until AFTER you make an account with their app, which I'm sure will send SPAM.",0
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed...",0
"I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills.",0
"I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you. What good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications. If I am going to pay for an app, it should at least have most of the features a free app has.",0
"No alarms for tasks. The widgets only show calender items(google already has this feature), not tasks. The stickers are garish and there is no option to upload your own art for the cover! The only cover designs are very basic and uninspired. Adding new tasks and reviewing existing tasks has a clunky UI. There's no weather or customizable habit tracking. Very disappointing, I was so ready to go digital, I guess it's back to designing my own planner every month :(",0
"I wanted to love this app, but it is so frustrating that every time I set a specific time for an appointment for example (physical therapy @ 3pm) it shows in my calendar an hour earlier & specifically lists it at 2pm. I've tried this a million times & no matter what the appointment shows in day mode as the correct time, but as an hour earlier in the monthly calendar mode. If I want to see the correct time in my calendar I have to enter it an hour later. So this makes the app completely unusable",0
"Didn't realize it was a ""pay after 2 weeks free""app. (That's on me for not reading). I'll stick to a paper calendar,much cheaper and still reliable. Dissappinted though. I would rather see a charge for the app up front than spoonfed charges monthly or when I want to unlock some feature. No one likes sharing personal data, financial data etc so the initial onslaught of required information and not knowing what will happen if you cancel is concerning as well.",0
"This app is really basic and doesn't have a lot of options or functions. I like that you can link a calendar, but it needs to consolidate those views, it's really cluttered. The app itself is glitchy. Entering in lists and placing stickers is glitchy. No matter how hard I try, I can't read anything I try to write on it. All of the covers are ugly! I HATE THIS APP! I went to cancel the day before my free trial ended, but it had already charged my card! :/ Now I'm stuck with this stupid app!",0
I was charged for a trial that I wasn't aware existed. There were challenges getting it set up on the app and I did more on-my-own navigating and reading than I would have liked. I'd prefer a need-to-know onboarding experience. I was charged almost $50 during a time when I was about to delete the app altogether. Getting a segment of customers by force whether intentional or not is a terrible business plan. I will certainly make sure to churn and use a competitor even if it cost more.,0
"Loads of good reviews online, but there's no option to share / collaborate on tasks, so it was a very quick uninstall for me. Strange omission.",0
New update is no use. Earlier version was user friendly. Now it's upto u,0
"changed everything once I got used to it, make me watch you tube, can't find my favorite feature.",0
Loved this app until the recent update. Now it takes extra taps to mark an event complete and it defaults to showing way too much information when you select a task. Needs to go back to the old setup.,0
"Update #3, 1.21.23: 2/5 stars because all my tasks from the past 6 months are now missing - I suspect from latest update? I sent a bug report and will change this review to higher score once my tasks are restored. Update #2, Aug '21 (edited): Have been using for years. Would be good to choose to have over due tasks only show up in folders instead of one big unread task list. Had to replace much of my old review, cos character limit for Play reviews.",0
Dev,0
"I saw a lot of people give this a great review, which is why I tried it. However, I had issues with reoccurring events not scheduling at the right time. I tried several different was to correct the problem and made sure it wasn't operator error. For example, I was trying to set a reoccurring event for 630 pm on Sunday, but it kept saving as 1230 pm. Overall, I ended up wasting my afternoon freetime trying to set up this calender/planner, but ended up frustrated, deleting the app.",0
"The app has become practically unusable. The grocery list section drop-down list always closes before I'm able to check items in the list. I also lost all my categories due to the updates üò°. I am using the paid version, but I will be switching to an alternative soon.",0
Requires registration. Nothing to see unless you register for at least the two-week trial. I wouldn't be interested in registering even if it were free unless it had very compelling reason to do so and really good privacy protection. I would be willing to consider paying for an app if it's good enough and it's not a subscription app. No way I'll know with this one.,0
"Update to developer response: No, I have never had this application before, so your response is incorrect. This was the first time and got charged.. good business üëå Fraud/ Falsely Advertised/ Dishonest Was immediately charged for the TWO WEEK FREE TRIAL. As they state, you will be charged AFTER your free trial has ended. Clearly see, I am not the only person who has this same problem. Not happy at all.",0
"SLOW on laptop, does not sync with website. No stickers on app, just laptop. I set up my calander on my ohone, then went to desktop. I can't open up my calander unlesss I give payment info on laptop. I already set up payment in Google Play. And to get to that screen takes a LONG time.",0
"This app is a total rip-off! I stupidly paid for the one-time subscription of $35.00, had the app less than one hour. The print was so tiny I could barely see it. A lesson learned the hard way...no more app subscriptions for me. Users beware! Forewarned is forarmed. Hang on to your wallets if you try out this app! 5/2/2021 I was charged $37.00 for this stupid app and I do not have it downloaded! I want the money refunded and put back on my credit card! This app is a TOTAL RIP-OFF!",0
I did a free trail and then Subscribed. I canceled my subscription and still haven't received my refund. I canceled in April or May. Do not fall for this app its a rip off. It's ridiculous I have reached out to them by email and they only responded only one time saying the refund was done. I checked with my bank until this day there is no refund in my account,0
"NOT a free trial. Do NOT give them your credit card details. I signed up for the 2 week trial, cancelled after 1 day as it wasn't what I was looking for. They have charged my card anyway! I will be contacting my bank to try to reverse the transaction.",0
Can't use this at all. The app or on a computer. I did get to email back and forth with tech support but they could not fix my problem. I am still not able to use it and I've updated my Google accounts several times like they suggested. I really wanted this to work but it did not.,0
"Doesn't work. I signed up for the free trial and heard nothing. No account confirmation, no welcome, nothing. So I thought it must not have gone through. Then two weeks later, a charge shows up on my card. I contact them to ask for a refund. After a few back and forth a, I finally get an email from Artful Agenda acknowledging my account. The first email. And then no further response from the company. It doesn't work with my work outlook account so it's a glorified Google calendar. Don't",0
Requires a credit card before you can even check out the trial. Been burned too many times to risk that again. I would much rather be in control of when I decide to complete a trial versus someone doing it for me upfront. Too bad because it looks interesting.,0
"Paid subscription required, they don't mention that in app details. They tell all the good, wonderful and pretty things. I unintalled, I find this misleading, and trying to be decietful, I would of tried it, If developers were up front.",0
"""Will you commit to paying $45‚Ä¶ for a Mystery Box?"" ""What's in the box?"" ""It's a mystery"". ""Then no."" You can't do a single thing until you commit to paying $45. You can't see the app, try it, experience it. Nothing. If it was good, they wouldn't need this, people would sign up anyway.",0
"I was very excited to use this app. It looks like something I would really use and enjoy; HOWEVER, read their privacy terms before you do. You have to link your existing calendar/email to use this app. It allows them access to ALL of your emails and some browser history. If they were truly JUST a planner company, they would provide an option to use their app alone. They're clearly mining and selling users data. BEWARE.",0
"NOT a free trial. Do NOT give them your credit card details. I signed up for the 2 week trial, cancelled after 1 day as it wasn't what I was looking for. They have charged my card anyway! I will be contacting my bank to try to reverse the transaction. - exactly my experience too. Subscription does not appear in my Google account so you have to search your card records to find it.",0
"CC Required To Use. Cannot even preview with limited features or ads? Not cool. I see you say this is so service isn't interrupted. That's what reminder notifications are sent for. If I like it, trust me, I'll pay for it. Looking for other app that doesn't require this.",0
"I wanted to love this so badly. Unfortunately, I need something that I can use on my computer AND my phone and this just will not function. The website says that the login page isn't working and the Windows app doesn't install anything but a blank page. Without syncing across multiple devices, this is useless to me. I need something I can count on.",0
"Pretend it's free but it's only a free trial.. I thought false advertising was illegal.. Devs are clearly unapologetic about this false advertising, which leads to consumers wondering what *else is being hidden in the code of this app. Without a completely free base version, devs are losing out on SO MUCH POTENTIAL. Such a focus on pay-to-play shows that they definitely do NOT value their customers, and being unwilling to offer a basic free version shows they wont listen to their consumer base",0
"I have been trying to log in from browser, but it constantly says wrong email or password. Cant get in to my account, this is so frustrating. They charged me the subscription fee, and I haven't even been able to use the service. No help or suport at all. (added) I have sen an e-mail to the email you have given with no response.",0
"I can't believe I have to provide MY information before you provide yours. Advertise what your cost is prior to asking users to sign up for a trial. I'll never know if it's worth it or not because they aren't willing to be transparent about their pricing. Glad to hear it's on your website. And yes, I know you can do a trial first.. point is why don't you show the price in the app before I put in my info for a trial. You're not upfront with your pricing when people download the app.",0
The app is not free. There is no free version. Wasted my time giving them my personal information to find out I also have to give them my credit card details just to even try the app out at all. Don't bother.,0
"I canceled my subscription months ago, but it auto-renewed and charged me again. Now I have to try to get my money back from them. Not happy.",0
"Edit: I have NOT received a refund. Canceling their subscription requires to jump through hoops. Don't expect to just log-in and cancel. I sent a message with Hey after sending others with info in which I got 0 replies. Yet you only focus on hey, your response proves the lack of care.

Skip this one entirely. Very scam-y.",0
"Downloaded and uninstalled within minutes. If you have to PAY for the app service, it should be stated up front and not after info input. I'm looking for a free app. No shade that y'all want $$$ however no where in the info says I gotta buy the service to use the app. And no, I'm not interested in a free trial. Edited to add that the replies I'm seeing left by this company are snarky as all hell. Even if I was looking to pay, seeing the unprofesh responses would deter me to another app.",0
"The recent updates stink. I LOVE this app, it's my lifeline for all my daily things, it the recent update now makes everything souch more difficult.",0
Push for new grocery list feature with auto order. Tried adding items. No auto ordering happen. Try and report bug but only get sent to a help page which repeats that this should be automatically done. How do you get bug reports if you block submits?,0
"Wear OS integration stopped working. It just shows me an alert ""Be sure to install the app on your phone first"" even though I have it installed. I tried to reinstall the app on my watch but I can't even find it in the store anymore :( Please help me.",0
"Decent but recent changes ahem Omer are not helpful! It's giving less sticky, pushing new features (üò¥) and makes me want to move to another app!ü§≠ I doubt replying to their customer feedback will get any changes. The priority will be paid customers naturally.",0
"App doesn't autosave. If we write a task and press home / the screen goes off, our unsaved task will be gone. Not robust enough",0
"It's extremely confusing. If you accidentally marked a repeating task as done and restore it, it shows multiple tasks including the original repeating tasks which date then shows the upcoming date. Marking a task with subtopics as done automatically marks everything is done instead of reminding you that it includes subtasks that needs to be completed... My ADHD can't with this app. It drives me mad.",0
"This used to be an amazing app. Now, i wouldnt recommend wasting your time with it. Recently, a lot of it has changed. Like for example, one of my favourite features of this app was that it would give you suggestions for your to do list like ""finish"" or ""clean"" or ""buy"" like sentence starters to prompt the ideas. Then they phased that and a bunch of other stuff out and now days it's just like every other to do list app. Seriously. Don't download it, it's not worth it.",0
"Barely used because recurring is under a paywall, that's a very common feature every app has for free.",0
The older version was much easier to use.,0
Can't rly do anything without paying fir premium. Couldn't figure out how to lay things out to look like how it does in the collab pictures on this app page. Just trying to find a trello alternative but this ain't it,0
"Very buggy. I've had syncing issues with recurring tasks and now when I open the app, the add task pop up appears at the bottom of my screen. I have to back out of that every time just so I can see my calendar or list of tasks. For an app that claims it will save you time, I've found the opposite to be true. I'll attempt to use it until my subscription is up for renewal. Definitely not worth the $35.99 I spent and I won't be investing in another year.",0
nice and good,0
"Not very intuitive and smart typing doesn't work across the different views; you have to be in a specific list. It's more convenient to be able to quickly add a task to a specific list from anywhere. Also, lack of task duration doesn't encourage practical planning; users can get carried away by adding too many tasks for a particular day and not achieve them despite all their planning. Stable desktop & mobile app; experienced no problems with syncing.",0
"I liked the app, but it is not opening anymore on my android note 20. Also, you may want to add ""Are you sure you want to delete / show completed"" pop up window on all the items. I have lost so many things because the app was lagging and it clicked when I didn't want it too. What a nuisance. Please fix it so I can use it again.",0
"Exactly what I was looking for. 16/03/2021. There have been some updates since then which have really worsened this up making me consider uninstalling it. Please, please developers, revert it back to how it was 2 years ago :'( For example whereas before I could see the calendar by month, now I can see it only by week which is really inconvenient. It is also bugging and going to February from the current date.",0
Required account so deleted. There is no need for an account of syncing is not wanted so it's unnecessary privacy invasion.,0
Wow,0
No webapp calendar view.,0
love it,0
It is not optimised for tabled. multi calendar support is not streamliend,0
Great straightforward notes app...when it works. I've always found it a bit glitchy but it seems to be getting much worse recently. To the point that it's almost impossible to use. Would not recommend and will be looking to find an alternative app.,0
Latest update is rubbish. It has removed all of the categories (even those I had edited) from the grocery list and now everything is just other which is pointless :( If it doesn't change back I'll be removing the app and go back to paper unfortunately,0
Not available for Samsung Watches,0
getting ready to uninstall. Keeps coming up with a notification saying it added bubba burgers and other stuff to my grocery list. Obviously paid promotions,0
New update broke grocery list. Can't even add a category. Please fix or I'll find another list...or a piece of paper.,0
"Was great, but features keep disappearing. Just lost grocery categories, no response from support.",0
"It's buggy & I dislike the interface. Also, you can only connect ut with other apps with the premium account. Not what I was looking for.",0
"Don't know what happened to this app, but I'm about to uninstall it List-making was very good with many optional subdivisions though it looks like I have lost that feature (& if that is now behind a paywall I've not found an easy way to upgrade)",0
Love it!! 9/7/21- what happened to the shopping list? 02/26/2023- I hate this and will be deleting most likely before renewal date. The daily moment is gone and now when it wants me to plan my day it gives me a list of tasks.... tasks even from my list of ideas of what to get my kids for Xmas. Before I could say when I was planning to do a certain task with ease. I don't understand why the change but this is about useless to me now.,0
Good app for organising but has a bug so haven't been able to use :((((((,0
I hate that you've removed categories from grocery list. The suggestive item feature is also gone. Stop saying an update is an improvement when it doesn't progress the experience.,0
"Getting slightly annoyed at the new ""my day"" that has replaced Moments. Not only the list to choose from completely ignores that some tasks are already scheduled for later, but it is also impossible to reschedule on the fly using this function. I find it now much harder to organize coming tasks over the week than with the previous versions.",0
I want to subscribe my premium acount,0
"Search feature is hidden somewhere? It shd be where it is now for global, plus also shd be able to search within respective my tasks too. And, new subtasks added should be added to the top or I should be able to sort it by date added, alphabetical etc too.... Long subtask are tedious to bring items the top of the list. And why do u have to make collaborate with others premium feature, it's basic... Else I would rather use Microsoft teams, trell etc better isn't it?",0
"I want a day planner that lets me set a time for tasks without there always being a reminder notification. This app can't seem to provide that. I'm also not happy with how the free option wasn't made available to me during sign up. Seems fishy to say ""free forever"" on the homepage, but when it comes to signing up, I only saw a 7 day free trial. The help section was a joke, so I unsubscribed immediately.",0
Very useful app except something has happened with the grocery list. I subscribed just for this list and now it looks like I will be removing my subscription. Dropped from 5 star to 2,0
"Really bad thing that you cannot convert regular list back to shop list, so you may delete your 100 items shoplist once you missclicked in list menu.",0
"Seriously Lame! ‚Äì Seriously limited interface. ‚Äì Only a few characters can be used per entry. ‚Äì Not easy to use. ‚Äì Task entries are huge, taking up screen real estate. ‚Äì Doesn't handle projects. ‚Äì Doesn't connect with other major apps. ‚Äì Help system is ineffective. ‚Äì I don't see any.do being anywhere near as effective as my multi-point diary. Any.do doesn't ask enuf of the right questions. It's not engaging, but boring. ‚Äì Any.do is get getting left in the dust of the competition.",0
This app is fine but sometimes is switch off my phone that I Will have to restart my phone,0
Needs refinement.,0
I believe the WhatsApp integration feature hasn't been working as expected. I've set a few daily task reminders on the app and turned on WhatsApp integration. I did get the reminders on WhatsApp a couple days but not anymore. Anytime i go back to edit a daily task all over again i get reminder the next day but not after that. Am I missing something. I'm asking specifically about the WhatsApp reminder as I don't check app notifications.,0
Doesn't work too great on the Pixel 6,0
it good5,0
there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface? new is ugly,0
"I tried this with my Android tablet, but the screen wouldn't rotate to landscape view; which made the text far too small to work with well. I unsubscribed based on this one lacking feature.",0
"I would love to try the app, but It requires a subscription to even try it or look around it. I hate having to unsubscribe in 2 weeks if I don't like it, because Lord knows my ADHD mind has done moved on. Let me look around, and if I want to keep using it, then make me sign up for it.",0
You can't even try it out. They are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything.,0
The app requires registration just to try the app. Cost of app isn't clear when signing up for free trial. Uninstalled.,0
bad need to buy to open it,0
Might want to include in your ad it's only 2 weeks free trial. Pointless to use it if I want it to be free.,0
"Might want to be up front this is not a free app, it's a free trial and you have to put your credit card info in order to access app.",0
Took my money after I canceled. It's a rip off! I canceled 3 day before because I wasn't using it and preferred my paper planner.,0
Cancelled the free trial ahead or time and still for charged. I sent a bunch of emails To get refunded and no one ever for back To me.,0
Had difficulty getting my calendar account to sync. Submitted two tech support tickets but never heard back.,0
"""Will you commit to paying $45‚Ä¶ for a Mystery Box?"" ""What's in the box?"" ""It's a mystery"". ""Then no."" You can't do a single thing until you commit to paying $45. You can't see the app, try it, experience it. Nothing. If it was good, they wouldn't need this, people would sign up anyway.",0
"There's one thing that makes me crazy about apps. It's when their developers don't tell you up front what the cost is of after the free trial. So, I won't be trying this as much as I'd like to.",0
Can't even see the basic functions without payment info and recurring payment setup. Yikes.,0
It's not a free app. Two weeks trial and then yearly subscription of 35 bucks or something. I just wanted a new calendar app because I don't like Google.,0
Only use if you pay. The second I download it wanted me to pay for a subscription. I couldn't x out if it or anything without putting my credit card information. Disappointing,0
"A ""free app"" requiring a credit card to start? I don't mind paying up front for a good app but please be honest about the cost up front. Deleted before completing login on principle.",0
"You have to pay to use. You can't even see what it's like without giving a credit card number first for the 2 ""free"" weeks trail",0
could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesn't mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid.,0
"I just got it and gave me a page where I had to start a trial, I'm not. I want a free calender where I can put a calender right on my phones home screen, don't get this app it wastes your time",0
"It is no better than free apps. It is harder to use and when I try to cancel it before getting charged all the links say ""server not found""",0
"Under description, the first sentence should be ""2 week free trial, but we do not offer a free version"". It's sad that you have to give out personal information just to get a 2-week free trial. It's not guaranteed that we would love this.",0
"It is not fair to say this app is free. It is free to download if you never plan to do anything with it. The ""in-app purchases"" are a subscription that is mandatory to pay after the 2 week trial period.",0
it's not free. It's only available for two weeks.i don't know why don't they just say that before we install,0
cost way to much for this,0
Wants you to subscribe. To a calendar.,0
"I can't believe I have to provide MY information before you provide yours. Advertise what your cost is prior to asking users to sign up for a trial. I'll never know if it's worth it or not because they aren't willing to be transparent about their pricing. Glad to hear it's on your website. And yes, I know you can do a trial first.. point is why don't you show the price in the app before I put in my info for a trial. You're not upfront with your pricing when people download the app.",0
Faulty/ Not dependable,0
Paid. No way to try without lengthy signup.,0
Have been using this app for some years now I have to delete since you guys no longer offer monthly subscriptions,0
It's not free and it doesn't even have a calendar.,0
Never even worked,0
"I canceled my subscription months ago, but it auto-renewed and charged me again. Now I have to try to get my money back from them. Not happy.",0
$50 a year with no option for monthly billing,0
Can't seem to reach anyone for customer service!,0
I hate that you need a card to try it. I don't want to be tricked into a subscription because I'm busy and forgot to cancel. So desperate. If i like it i buy it. Like an adult. Period.,0
Not free,0
Too confusing to use and there aren't any prompts to help guide you.,0
"This app is really basic and doesn't have a lot of options or functions. I like that you can link a calendar, but it needs to consolidate those views, it's really cluttered. The app itself is glitchy. Entering in lists and placing stickers is glitchy. No matter how hard I try, I can't read anything I try to write on it. All of the covers are ugly! I HATE THIS APP! I went to cancel the day before my free trial ended, but it had already charged my card! :/ Now I'm stuck with this stupid app!",0
"Update to developer response: No, I have never had this application before, so your response is incorrect. This was the first time and got charged.. good business üëå Fraud/ Falsely Advertised/ Dishonest Was immediately charged for the TWO WEEK FREE TRIAL. As they state, you will be charged AFTER your free trial has ended. Clearly see, I am not the only person who has this same problem. Not happy at all.",0
App continues to try to charge me account after I canceled the trial in advance.,0
I was fully charged before the end of the trial period,0
bad need to buy to open it,0
I was charged for a trial that I wasn't aware existed. There were challenges getting it set up on the app and I did more on-my-own navigating and reading than I would have liked. I'd prefer a need-to-know onboarding experience. I was charged almost $50 during a time when I was about to delete the app altogether. Getting a segment of customers by force whether intentional or not is a terrible business plan. I will certainly make sure to churn and use a competitor even if it cost more.,0
This app does not have a free version. It only has a subscription version. I'm not interested to give my payment details for the 2 weeks free trial. It would have been better if there was a free version but with limited features like many other planner apps.,0
Very upset that I could not get my password to work or even get any way of communicating this issue with this company. Would love this app otherwise. There is no way of contacting them. Sad was so interested in this planning app.,0
Do not download this app unless you plan to pay for a subscription. It says a free 2 week trial but will not let you continue unless ypu sign up with a credit card once in the app.,0
"Woh!! Hidden extras here, I downloaded this purely going on recommendation from here, but as soon as I signed up its telling me its a free trial obviously after you have to pay. Is this in tiny, tiny small print somewhere as I didn't spot it, so I've deleted it",0
I instantly unsubscribed when I was registrating it and it gave me no other options than a 2 week free trial and had no information of that the price was after that. Backing people into a wall I don't want anything to do with.,0
"False advertising! I downloaded this because it was FREE ""with in app purchases"" which I'm used to. Apparently, it is only free for 2 weeks and then you need to pay a subscription fee. No thank you!",0
Awful. I have been trying to cancel for months and I have spent hours on calls trying to get this app to stop charging me. It just won't go away!!! I don't recommend it unless you want a lifelong commitment to it!!! BEWARE,0
I can't even try a a watered down version of the app. I have to automatically sign up for the membership. It is not give you any sampling whatsoever. You cannot go past signing up for the membership,0
Thiefs!! I cancelled last year after my free trial and they still took $35.00 and refused to refund my money. I verified it was cancelled and woke up this morning to them stealing another $35.00. I don't even use their crappy product!!!!!! OH AND THERE IS NO WAY BESIDES E-MAIL TO GET AHOLD OF THEM!!,0
"Issues setting up and syncing, was not easy to navigate at all. Canceled within a few days after installing, still was charged first full month of service.",0
Kept my interest for one second after installing the app. The app forces registration with personal information immediately. There's no ability to experience the app and its features prior to registration. That is an absolute No-No,0
"This app is incredibly glitchy. Events save under the wrong date and time, which literally makes the entire app unreliable and useless.",0
Did not like this at all. Difficult to sync with all my different calendars and limited formatting and design options as well. Also hard to unsubscribe. Very round about process. I do not recommend this.,0
"The price isn't worth the benefit. I'm opting for a different app and after reading the number of people who canceled and were charged anyway, am glad I didn't give my cc information for a 2 week trial. I recommend allowing people to try it first and then opt in to paying to continue. Otherwise, y'all just seem shady.",0
Download the app and filled everything out and then tried to start my subscription but it kept giving me an error even though I know that the credit card that I was using is feet completely fine. Guess I won't get to try this one after all,0
Have been using this app for some years now I have to delete since you guys no longer offer monthly subscriptions,0
Very glitchy. Recurring events don't work properly and I constantly get error messages. Not user friendly and no features that are worth the money.,0
Downloaded free trial and looked at it first day and it wasn't really easy to use so didn't look at it again. I had no correspondence from them to tell me that the trial was over and that they were going to take the money. I find that deceptive behaviour as they are banking o people forgetting to cancel.,0
$50 a year with no option for monthly billing,0
"Unable to add screenshots to tasks, links or sub tasks - like a list under To Dos. Clunky. I deleted it within the hour because there's no way this calendar would help me keep track of my daily tasks etc.. This is for a less busy person.",0
"What I don't understand is that you have to pay for it. It's kind of unreasonable, and I'm just looking for a digital planner app that you don't have to pay for and works for Chromebooks/laptops. I've tried two other apps, and those don't work either. At this point, I should just buy a paper planner.",0
I hate that you need a card to try it. I don't want to be tricked into a subscription because I'm busy and forgot to cancel. So desperate. If i like it i buy it. Like an adult. Period.,0
Not worth the money. Lost $35.00 don't use the app and don't like the app! Would not buy and have had less than a month and can not get my money back on a year subscription. üòí,0
"Not free, the app says you get two weeks free but requires you to put in your credit card information and you can cancel before trial period ends to not be charged. Yeah, no, I'm good.",0
I only had it for a couple of hours. You can't change the font color for light colored highlights. It also wouldn't change the colored that I did pick for events.,0
only option is paid subsctiption app? No thanks. I can't constantly pay for apps within my budget so I'd much rather have the option to use a version with ads.,0
I got the free trial. I started adding events to the calendar and they would not save. I tried different days and nothing would stay saved.,0
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.,0
Although its.pretty I did not use it so cancelled the subscription. They have billed me again for this even though cancelled through their service and following their instructions on how to do it so ensure you use a payment method they can't override.,0
"Not worth the annual fee, and its difficult to cancel the subscription. It's basically just a paper calendar but harder to use",0
I was charged for a year subscription even though I cancelled within the free trial period. So now I have a $40 app I won't use because it doesn't have the features I need in a calendar app.,0
App opens up to 2 week trial registration with zero info about how much subscription costs. So I have to give them my email address before they'll even tell me what I'm signing up for? No thank you.,0
"Once again, another app that doesn't make it clear you have to pay to use it. Worst part, it's not a one time payment. If I go to Wal-Mart and buy an agenda it's a one time payment until the next year. I guess I'm sticking with paper",0
Not happy and it WONT let me cancel my subscription. There is NO option for it despite logging on online to follow their instructions. How do I cancel before im charged for an app that is literlly no good for me or going to help me in anyway? Not impressed. Would give 0 stars if I could.,0
I'm sorry but a monthly subscription to use a calendar? That's ridiculous. I'd rather have ads or just buy the app outright; paying monthly for a planner is the biggest scam I've ever seen.,0
App continues to try to charge me account after I canceled the trial in advance.,0
"Just because your app description says it, it doesn't make it okay. No one will pay for an app they can't even try with a free trial before using the app. You want people to pay, hoping they'll forget to cancel the subscription. And you aren't a household name! You can't expect people to pay for a service when we don't know who you are or your reputation. Youre a con and a scam.",0
Terrible! I transferred all my lists from Google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didn't save! So beyond frustrating.,0
"It's not actually free. They will tell you there's no secrets because they say you have to subscribe in the description, but they know what they're doing. Also, if you can say ""Plan in Style!"" In your name you can put ""Subscription Planner"" instead. Maybe people won't leave you bad reviews for being misleading.",0
"I was excited to start this app but not only do you have to create your own account but you are REQUIRED to sign into your Google, icloud, or Microsoft account. Seriously? Why can I just use the app without connecting, what even the point of creating a account then? So disappointing",0
I didnt not use it enough. I canceled my subscription and was still charged for it. I have emailed them about returning my money but no one has responded. I dont not recommend the trail part if your not ready to purchase .,0
"Subscribed to see what it was, decided it was not for me, cancelled the subscription, and found out 6 months later they have been charging me monthly the whole time. Totally unimpressed.",0
This app does not work. It does not function properly. It does not connect to my calendars. It does not let me put anything appointments properly. I am very frustrated with it.,0
No free trial! As soon as you open the app it says you need to sign up and you'll get 2 weeks free then $35/ yr will be charged. I was going to try it but it immediately charged my account with no free trial. I was not happy. I have requested a refund and will not be looking at this again.,0
It's free but only for two weeks. What a joke.,0
"This used to be the best app; I basically ran my life off it. Over the last couple of months, it has been crashing and saying there is a bug. I reached out to support, and after 3 weeks, they have yet to respond. Without being able to open the app, it is (obviously) unusable. Dear Todoist: Please respond to my 2 support emails. That would be dope. UPDATE: To whomever responded to this review, I have yet to be issued a support ticket number. I have sent a third email this morning. Cheers!",0
"It used to works perfectly,but suddenly I have problems synchronizing my calendars... It's empty now",0
Doesn't really work. Simple things like seeing the month ahead requires a payed upgrade. Pointless.,0
"The PC version is still unusable and the mobile version still struggles. After some use, both seem to get stuck in some kind of processing loop or grind that prevents it from loading tasks and events. Randomly, it will load quickly, other times it will load some and not others for a seemingly random amount of time from minutes to eternity. Another huge headache is the random pop-up of dozens of permanent notifications for far-past uncompleted tasks. Moving events is buggy. I reported all.",0

Forces you to sign up to use the CALENDAR! Does not have pomodoro or any type of focus time.,0
Immediately asked for a credit card. Fail.,0
"It's okay on PC, but the mobile app is brutally slow. Also, marking a task as completed from the notification shade will send your phone to a 1hz refresh rate if you have an LTPO display. It's like nails on a chalkboard after the smooth 120hz.",0
Tasks don't sync up,0
"You know, with so many features, it fails at the most essential, simple, basic use case for people like me who struggle with remembering routines. I just want a list that I can check off every day with the stuff I need to do each morning. I don't want the recurring item to show up immediately after I hit complete; I need the satisfaction of having completed them to last more than a friggin second. If Google keep automatically unchecked my stuff in the widget it would be perfect.",0
moneymoneynoney,0
The reminders have stopped coming through so it doesn't help at all.,0
The app won't let me login despite having an account. It gives random errors that don't make sense.,0
"Yearly subscription model for a freakin to-do list. By my calculations, if you write your checklist in literally any other way that isn't this app, you will never spend more in your whole goddamn life than you did on 1 year of Ticktick Pro.",0
"Tierd of forever waiting for any fixes. Back to the old reliable Google Tasks. I like the app. But even with unrestricted battery and internet access, the task reminders are always late, some don't even come and it only shows 1 new notification instead of showing the task body. Add a locked view mode as default on task list while only viewing the task, to prevent accidental mistouch.",0
"use to be a great app, now it just doesn't work. i have missed all my task for last two weeks.",0
"Notification are not detected in ""samsung wearable"" app. So i cant get notifications on watch 4. Its such a small problem, just solve it.",0
For me the reminder is not working do slove the issue asps,0
The fact that the length of an entry can't be changed from the 1 hour default unless you subscribe to their ridiculously expensive service makes the free version DOA. I'd rather use Google Calendar.,0
"Ticktick was awesome at first but Google Calendar has never and just will not sync consistently. This is a deal breaker for me, I need to find something else.",0
"Unfortunately, there is no way to transfer your offline to do lists from one phone to another.",0
"Music?!? I tried to watch the 1 minute tutorial and BAM loud music you cannot turn down! Forget it! I get out of that and next thing I know, BAM!! Music again! I didn't even get a chance to try to app before I couldn't take it anymore!",0
Not sastified about the features of the premium version. Tried to be refund less than 2 hours after the purchase and Google refused to refund me. Very dissapointed about this purchase.,0
Bad,0
"You said free 7 days trial, and yet a 2.76$ has deducted from my account",0
Worthless if not premium,0
Can't even sign up with an email. All I get is server error.,0
This app used to be a great until they took some feature to premium such as constant reminder feature....now it sucks cause you miss you reminders because the app doesn't ring constantly it only ring once for two seconds. I've deleted the app now.,0
Basic Google integration is also paid,0
After last update pome timer and stopwatch not work properly fix,0
Why my task moves to completed when its done. I mean I get the idea of completed but I want my sub task to stick to section for me to recognise how much of a section is completed. If there are multiple task/section and multiple subtask how can I recognise which sub task belong to which task/section after completion. This is the basic thing...!!!! Would have bought it.,0
Used this app for years and now they decide to change it to where you can't see the calender anymore and will have to 35$ to use it annually. That is a joke.,0
I have a task list and I am directed to this app and can't get out of it so I'm going to remove the whole thing,0
No monthly widget unless you pay lol,0
For month and weekly calender view they ask to take premium of 1k something üôÑ,0
Did not like the update. Old version was simple and to the point. Looking for a new app.,0
Lame,0
Couldn't figure out how to use it. Not intuitive.,0
"Can't access images that you've uploaded, neither to reuse them, nor to delete them. And on top of that, if you want to reuse the same picture twice, you have to wait till tomorrow, because you can only add a picture once per day.",0
"Despite reporting issues and downloading the updated TickTick app, my powerful phone still experiences frequent freezing and lagging when I use the app. As a premium user, the persisting problems make me reluctant to continue using the app, and uninstallation seems inevitable due to its sluggish performance. It's very sad!",0
"I had quite a few lists and with whatever refresh they did, all of my content disappeared",0
"I understand updates so the app works with new devices BUT ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" As others have stated things have been moved, doesn't replace the old version so now I have 2 programs giving notifications, didn't keep the custom notification sounds. Like the program, don't like this update.",0
Its buggy .. when i put something for daily .. everytime i check it jump to next day . In a way u cant have daily to do lists that can recreate by itself everyday . Cause if u check them it shows u one from tomorow and if u check that .. it shows from 2 days later . I installed this to overcome procastination . These little things just make it not work properly,0
"Went from good to bad. Recent upgrade to my phone force me to the latest version. I would have to pay all over again. The easy swipe to change list was gone, can't change it back. And worst of all the reminders pop up on top of the screen whether locked or not and I can't do anything else until I clear it. Dug through the settings but couldn't find any fixes. It was a simple to-do list and now it's just a chore. Uninstalling",0
"THEY KEEP CHARGING ME! Used this app once, 5 years later, I still can't get in touch and they charge me $28/annually and are now triggering fraud alerts on my credit cards. DO NOT PURCHASE Update : I filed a claim through PayPal but they only refunded me for one year. They didn't respond to my message and now the case is closed. This company is a scam.",0
Still makes loud noises even with the app's notifications disabled at the OS level. Unacceptable; please fix.,0
"No notification Xiaomi watch 2 pro, even though there is a dedicated app on the WearOS. So disappointing!",0
"Bring forth the option of ""one time payment"" for lifetime premium use and I will give 5 star.",0

"It is almost impossible to use. The user interface could not possibly been developed by someone who has ever used the application. There is no way the developers have ever tried to use the application. At the very least, they have never listened to the feedback from a single tester that was not a part of the development team. Before you pay for this, try to create a calendar event, give it a start and end time, save it, then try to move it to another day/time. Good luck.",0
Incredibly frustrating. Deleted all tasks and they still show up. Want to start from scratch and can't. I guess I have to create a new email address and start a new account? Ridiculous,0
Signing in with Google is stuck. Lame app.,0
After a few days I don't know why it totally stopped working..leaving that overall this app has really nice features,0
Intrusivs tracking,0
It's everytime I have a warning that the app has been closed and this's after subscribe in premuim,0

"Customer support either don't speak English or are incompetent. An entire list has stopped showing me details on android since a recent update, luckily it works on browser still. But I've messaged customer support in clear terms with screenshot provided and they're trying to direct me to completely illogical places and obviously have no idea what they're doing. It's not the first time that theyve responded in nonsensical ways, wasting my time for no reason. I'm a paying member too.",0
I have reported a programming/coding logic flaw in 2022 that the task completion sound uses the media audio channel instead of the notification audio channel. They still have not corrected it in 2 years. Incomprehensible negligence.,0
In new update of the app you had cut almost all functions (f.e. day view) if user don't have pro version. App became unusable.,0

"Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data",0
"I was forced to sign in (create account), when I signed up. Lost all of my tasks and history. Not sure how to get it back.",0
After the latest update the app got terrible. The calendar is invisible. You need to check before making updates and changes to your app.,0
Still makes loud noises even with the app's notifications disabled at the OS level. Unacceptable; please fix.,0
Tasks are not synced in the background. You have to open the app to fetch changes from other devices. That's ridiculous,0
Cannot actually open (tap on) tasks anymore. The app just shows a transparent background and nothing gets shown.,0
"TickTick is great overall, but the current version of the app crashes when adding a task, making it totally unusable as a task manager.",0
"Unable to subscribe. I am from India. I think this might be the reason. Whenever I click on pay, it shows ""Unavailable for this purchase"". I have tried using different debit/credits cards. Still same issue. If I open in desktop, I can pay using PayPal. But while converting dollar to rupees, it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price. Also I feel, 1300 Bucks for this is a bit pricy. But seeing American economy, and price in dollars, it may be cheap. But here costly",0
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.,0
The reminders have stopped coming through so it doesn't help at all.,0
Can't even sign up with an email. All I get is server error.,0
"Been a happy paid user of GTasks for many years. When I changed phone, it downgraded me to the unpaid version. They removed the paid app from the store! They have this new Tick Tick app that requires monthly/yearly subscription to access full functionality. I am not paying them again so I am moving to Google Tasks app. It gives me the same functions as the paid GTasks; and is fully integrated to Google Calendar. I can use it on all my devices and notification sound is set via Calendar app.",0
"1. Mobile app and desktop app not synced well. I lose some of subtasks caused of this. 2. The task list (in calender view) not ordered properly. I need to re-order many tasks based on priority and time by myself, and manually. Already submitted 2 feedbacks in the setting > feedback & suggestion. Please take a look. I provided screenshots as well. As a paid user, need to change the star to 1 for this. Will change it again after this solved. Thanks!",0
"Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do",0
"Not recommended. Looks promising at first but search function is broken, among other things. Totally useless. Contacting support is a pain because they only reply when they want to, and they only pick the issues they want to fix. Not something you'd expect for a paid subscription service. So if you have a lot of notes, don't expect the search function to work for you. Find another better app.",0
"I upgraded my phone, and the app won't sign into a new device!",0
"Really good! I've been using it for one year now and fits me really well, but recently it had this issue where it would log me out from my account. It did this a couple of times until finally didn't let me open the app anymore. I tried everything: reinstall, delete cache, restart my phone... it just won't work. I can still log in from google but it would be really great if I could use the app as before.",0
"Feels incomplete, a bunch of features that are ""usable"" but not as good as its competitors. There's a lot of potential with this app but it feels dated and cumbersome to use, having to go through all the menus just to find the feature that you want, almost anxiety inducing. Overall, a bit of a mistake buying the membership, I really thought I could optimise my experience but in reality, using Google tasks + notion is a lot better.",0
"while using the habbit feature, you can add multiple reminders for drinking water, but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day. ruins the logic. Uninstalled Installed a year later and still the issue exists, the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but I guess I'll have to use another one.",0
Used this app for years and now they decide to change it to where you can't see the calender anymore and will have to 35$ to use it annually. That is a joke.,0
"This was a great app but keep making changes that make it worse. For example you used to be able to merge two tasks together, but now doing so just makes one task a subtask of the other, it doesn't actually merge them into one task and there doesn't seem to be a way around it. Edit - Also if you edit tasks on the web version (which is a quicker way of working around some of the apps flaws) it doesn't seem to synchronize with the Android app, I now have a real mess of old and new tasks",0
"My experience is the exact same as Theodore's review below. Constant syncing problems with google making the app completely unusable. Started happening around the same date as well (around July 25 2020). I emailed the support team with a description and screen shots of the problem and still haven't received a reply. TickTick USED to be a great app but has progressively gotten worse, and now unusable. That's okay though, I've had to switch back to Todoist because of these issues.",0
"Unfortunately, there is no way to transfer your offline to do lists from one phone to another.",0
Incredibly frustrating. Deleted all tasks and they still show up. Want to start from scratch and can't. I guess I have to create a new email address and start a new account? Ridiculous,0
"Edited : after last update is miserable. Screen got stuck when scroll down can't go up again. It is not as smooth as before when scrolling. And... Why do u REMOVE the pull down to refresh?? Now the schedule won't sync across all my device! If u remove the pull down, at least provide one refresh way. Either it is button or on a menu. U totally destroy a perfect app!!!",0
"Used this app and subscribed for 7-8+ years, had rated 5 star in the past and it is brilliant when it works. Now changed to 1 star because it is literally unusable for the last month or two. App is crashing constantly, sync issues and inconsistency between platforms. Keep losing entries. Contacted development and had no response. Tried my own fixes and no luck. Cancelling subscription and trialling other apps which is a shame.",0
I created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day. Why in the world would the default setting in this app be to override my *do not disturb* setting and ring+vibrate at 5 o'clock in the morning on that day. Even though I like the apps functionality I would never recommend it to anyone with these default settings.,0
Best and worst app ever! I like the app in general BUT all the good features are PREMIUM so it's telling you to go premium because the available features are the ones that you have on your default phone calendar! You can't access to thee three day calendar view isn't.. the to-do list isn't either available so what's the point of having the app if you can't access to anything literally BAD APP,0
"I had used this company for 6 years. All of a sudden my subscription abruptly ends. I contact their support team and within 4 weeks got four replies, all of which were unhelpful. Having subscribed so long ago I was paying ¬£11.99 per year... it very much looks like the company cancelled my subscription with the intention of pushing me to the new/higher price of ¬£27.99 per year. Customer service was atrocious, with over a week between replies. Very disappointed, the app was pretty good but I will no longer use it, or the company, based on these actions and the woefully bad customer service. I will also be cancelling my sons renewal and no longer recommend this app/company.",0
"Generally happy with the app, but it's so annoying that notifications wake up the lock screen. While running with my phone in the pocket, TickTick woke up my screen, I accidentally unlocked the screen through the contact between my leg and screen (smart unlock feature helped) and then started sending messages to a friend. That shouldn't happen. Please fix this issue or at least give us the option to deactivate lock screen notifications. Using a OnePlus 7T Pro. Thanks! PS Already sent a ticket",0
Clunky and unintuitive. An absolute slog to use. Id rather use a notepad.,0
"Always loved this app, solid 5*. But now it changed font settings and the app's font is tiny - even when increasing the font in the app (that changes the list's font, not the app's font). Mind, it also means it doesn't follow my OS font settings because they're larger. So, accessibility fail.. I gave this a 2* review a few days ago, now 1* as the font decreased even further. Now need it at 'extra large' and even then the font is nowhere near large in the body. Rest of app's font is TINY. Absurd.",0
"The minute I opened it, it offers me to buy a subscription.",0
"Needs an option to set reminders for multiple times a day (ex: taking medicine every 8 hours). The Alexa app even has that option, don't understand why this wouldn't. It seems like it's a very desired option on reddit and many people have suggested, but no update.",0
Okk,0
"I upgraded my phone, and the app won't sign into a new device!",0
they swapped around the snooze and complete option even when I press snooze now it completes them and I have to Go back into the app and fix it,0
"It feels easy to use TickTick, but if a list has too much message, then it will feel hard, so that it will hang. However, it doesn't work anymore because ... For example, if a task has the time 10:00 am, then at 10:00 am, it doesn't work.",0

"THEY KEEP CHARGING ME! Used this app once, 5 years later, I still can't get in touch and they charge me $28/annually and are now triggering fraud alerts on my credit cards. DO NOT PURCHASE Update : I filed a claim through PayPal but they only refunded me for one year. They didn't respond to my message and now the case is closed. This company is a scam.",0
"Can't even see how good this app is because of errors. Everything I want to look at or use needs to have a subscription.

I cannot send you a ticket in the app. The link does not work. Send me an email and I will send you a screenshot.",0

"5 stars for the absolute best to-do app I've ever used. 1 star for being yet another stupid subscription when I just want to buy the app and be done with it.

"I used to love ticktick. I have it on mobile Android and Windows 10 client. They used to sync beautifully. Around 23 Aug, the desktop client and mobile stopped syncing and acted like two separate accounts. In desperation, i reinstalled desktop client. I couldn't log into client nor thru browser. It complained of network configuration and proxies. i don't use proxies. I can log into any account online except ticktick. The help rep is unresponsive. Super disappointed. I'm on premium. I want refund",0
"Software is not a service. No, I'm not paying $27 a year for an app that developers can quit working on at any time, or make random changes to when it strikes their fancy. I buy SOFTWARE that I then USE. I do not pay to subscribe to SERVICES that may become UNAVAILABLE to me at a developer's choice. Uninstalled immediately. Change your billing to a one time fee and I'll consider trying it again. Until then, NO app is worth a long term subscription. SOFTWARE! IS! NOT! A! SERVICE!",0
I hope that as a PAID user you don't mind losing three years worth of appointments occasionally.,0
"Used to like this app. I was active with feedback for bugs too. Then they started adding in awful features, with no option to turn them back off. The latest update, you can't even reorder your tasks anymore. You can drag them, but they just flick back to original position every time. This is because the update forced us to have the tasks sorted by time. Stupid garbage idea you forced on us there. Deleting it now",0
"I've used this for years and years... Always using inbox display so I can easily rearrange the order of my tasks for the day. However, the newest update has a glitch where, after I arrange my tasks, half of them jump back about a minute later.

Thank you!",0

"In general I really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts, I have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise I don't receive notifications.

Really clean and seems to have a lot of good features but I got this app specifically to make grocery shopping lists to share with my husband. I have sent him the collaboration invite multiple times and the list has not appeared in his app. The collab feature goes not appear to work.,0
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.,0
"Recently started having problems when creating a check list on a task in notes... After creating 1 bullet point, the next one will duplicate itself. If I try to correct it, it will change/delete the other. Love the app, but this is really frustrating! Anyone else?",0
"So greedy app, it only wants you to pay,if you wouldn't pay you won't be able to use the app, there's only 5 habits you can set in the app or buy the premium version to set 6, additional to the biggest problem which's the price thet you should pay it is so expensive, also no any kind of discounts for students, all these problems is terrible, greedy, and make the app useless, and you can't use most content in the app,i'm so frustrated about the app and I'm really thinking to permanently delete it",0
Surprisingly bad on wear os. Unexpected when mobile is always so polished. Can do very little with it,0
"Not too good for Android! I have the App in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my Android and found out that that version doesn't have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature, create or editing folders, etc. etc. Very disappointed about that, because the App concept seems to me very good. :(",0
"Everything looks great but, 1. The pomo Timer should show the exact time focused on the tasks for which it is used for. 2. Calendar should be made ""free"" rather than putting it into premium version. 3. Huge issue with Reminders, they don't work pretty well.",0
"The widget doesn't check or scorethrough when you tick the box from the widget, it just sends it to the bottom of the list and leaves it present and unchecked as if you haven't completed it yet. This is with ""show completed"" setting being OFF too. So can't tell what's been done or not.",0
"Free download- get a few basic features, but anything else you have to upgrade for $35/yr. Any colors, themes, view the calendar as month, week, 3-day, etc. You can only use your local phone calendar for free. To incorporate any other you have to upgrade. B.S. app! Uninstalled.",0
"The interface is ok. But TickTick does *not* sync with Google Tasks. (You can import Google Tasks, but no tasks added in TickTick app will appear on Google calendar.) If a task list doesn't integrate with Google Tasks, if I am limited to using the standalone app and *cannot* see tasks on other devices / computers, then the task mgmt. app isn't really good for anything.",0
it's a really good application but the annoying thing that all of the good features you have to subscribe for them,0
"App keeps on crashing, I can barely use this app at all even though I still have a lot of available space.",0
"Needs lot of improvents UX wise 1. If the all the lists are only accessible from the menu which only shows up in the first tab why not make that on the bottom bar like evernote, todoist, google tasks, etc 2. Also, Note editor is not good..it is buggy. Note flickers when scrolling Plus, that shortcut to make note bold, italics etc are very annoying. Copying the note to google docs is so hard because of those ""*"" and ""#"" which also get copied and the format also changes",0
"It's a great app with tons of features, however the support just stopped answering my questions and I can't use it on Android (Pixel) anymore. When I try to add a task, after writing some characters, the app suddenly minimizes itself and don't save anything. So sad. I'm a premium anual user, but I'm moving to another app...",0
"Great, except for some nasty things with the subscription. I had apparently subscribed last year and completely forgotten about it. It happens. But for one there was no notification of upcoming renewal of the subscription and finding how to stop the subscription was far harder than expected.",0
"I'm at awe how the tick tick guys keep managing to destroy a perfectly working app by having to redesign it every once in a while just for the sake of saying that they're keeping the app running. Now I can't delete the messages because it's almost barely visible once I push the three dots or lines on the tasks and there is no way to scroll the choices to see the delete option. Please, for the love of gods, don't work so hard to ruin a perfectly functioning software. I'd love to ask, just why?",0
"At first I thought, what a nice app because it had most of the important functions for free. But then, I'm not sure the problem is my phone or what, maybe I'll just address the problem as it's not functioning in all devices properly as the reminder I set didn't remind me at the time it's supposed to, when I opened the app to check whether it's my negligence, then I received a notification saying I need to allow smth at my settings. I went thru all my settings there's no such thing to allow.",0
It was a great app but after the latest versions there is a lot of problems in the app and the biggest one is that i can't log in with my google's account or facebook's account,0

"It's good that reminders wake the screen up. But why do they wake the screen when the phone is in my pocket? On top of that why are the reminder ""descriptions"" that pop up, editable?? So what actually happens to me is that some reminder wakes my screen when in the pocket and since the screen is in touch with my body, all the reminder description get rewritten with non sense words.",0
"No doubt the app is good but one has to press a lot of buttons to add/edit a task, for e.g., selecting date/time, recurrence, list etc. It is too much of playing around with the buttons. Besides, when I mark the task as done, my phone freezes for a few seconds. And for the premium, the quick add ball is not showing on the lock screen. I reported these two issues to the developer but they never looked into it. I am now reverting back to Life Reminders which I had purchased long back.",0
"The app on android is so bad, that I can't compare it to the Mac app. The calendar integration is practically not working. The today list is listing all the events from the calendar while I am specifically setting all 3rd party calendar to show events only in the calendar. And there is no way to have different calendar settings between the app and the Mac desktop app.",0
"Features are really awesome but the app takes forever to open. By the time it opens up, I have already lost the task to be written. I opted out of premium after getting so tired of the app freezing on my phone and on the web. Again the app has really good features but the performance issue is a killer because the whole point of a productivity app like this is to get things done. Would give it a 5 star when this gets fixed. Please look into it and solve this churn problem to get your users back!",0
"After update, I couldn't log in to my Google account, the button Allow wasn't working. After applying the workaround and setting an email in web-version, my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts. I allowed it, the pop-up in the app did not disappear. After pressing 'ok' several times, it went away. However, now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud. I wanted to buy Pro, not anymore. You can't fix the bug with Google account for several months now. Embarrassing.",0
Everything was great until I added the Pomodoro widget which literally crashed my phone and required multiple restarts. So thanks for that. Uninstalled.,0
"It was working properly in the beginning.. later i could hear only the reminder tone not any notification on the notification bar or pop-up to check. All of sudden the music starts playing, i need to refresh and clear recent tabs every time to just stop that reminder tone",0
"My biggest problem is that there's no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but I'd like to try before I buy. Also, as a first time user there's a few issues: I downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesn't work well for all pages (especially the habit details page). There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet).",0
"I would like my appointments from calendar to appear on the ""plan your day"" notification, so I could properly plan my day considering every task I have to do. But it appears that this is a feature only for TickTick premium users. As a free user, I can only see my appointments inside the app, but do not receive notifications for it. It's a shame, I was enjoying the app, but it do not attend my requirements right now.",0
"This is a good app and it's premium subscription is helpful for me. However, the main page as well as it's widgets show today's overdue tasks in blue rather than in red. If a task is overdue by 2hrs, then that should be shown in overdue list and not today list. Same with widgets, there should be another filter to display only overdue tasks even if they are only overdue by 2hrs and future tasks should not get displayed in the list. Hence I am reducing the number of stars in my review.",0
Veery veery Nice,0
Everything is perfect except one thing: add timers in the watch app. I bought a smart watch thinking I could also track time in my ticktick there but to my utter disappointment that the watch app is the most basic app there is. Add just even a little bit of the functionality from the phone app to the watch app atleast! And to also note I am a subsriber for a year now. I also use the galaxy watch 4. Please add the timers there.,0
"Fantastic app. With the latest update though, it keeps crashing on me. üòï",0

"Started fine, deteriorated. Ap has taken itself to default adding a due time to any note added even if one is not wanted resulting in push notifications you also did not ask for but worse than that is incessant warnings the app is not up to date while trying to use it only to be told play store does not have an update while trying to get the latest version.",0

"You asked me to pay premium version but instant Google calendar sync still doesn't work, needs few hours for tasks to sync. This been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users. On the other hand the Gtasks app you have works really great.",0
"This is a good app and I transferred here from wunderlist, however one gripe I have is that you can only invite one person to share the list with. I can understand if the limit was, say 3 or 4, but for only one person to be the max is unreasonable to me just to buy premium to get 29 slots.",0
"This app is good. I even figured out how to easily add things to my shopping list using google assistant using IFTTT. Unfortunately their email feature is terrible. Todoist somehow is able to display attached emails, while TickTick just opens Gmail without loading the message. Unfortunately this makes it useless.",0
"Been using this app for a few years. But I notice a weird behaviour after the most recent updates. When I add a new habit, I don't see it added on the habit list anymore. It just disappeared after adding. It must be a bug! Please fix it. I would give 5 star if it's resolved.",0
"It was okay in the beginning, but it's shortcomings are becoming more glaring with use. Also recently the habits simply disappeared recently and the pop up for check in is annoying. I paid for the premium and won't be renewing for a second.",0

I went back to notepad and pencil after this update Devs still haven't fixed the issue with tags staying in the textboz even after hitting enter and submitting something to a list. Makes the app unusable or just extremely annoying to use. It was a nice app a while ago but not functioning well anymore.",0
"The removal of the calendar as a free feature? Who's idea was that? This app is now completely pointless for anyone who needs visual representation of what tasks they have to get done. Unless all you want is a digital checking list with hastags, do not try this app",0
"Some tasks do not stay saved on the day I completed them, so I can't keep of track them. I have the ""Show Completed"" option on. I don't like the new design, it's blocky and the theme I liked to use changed. The old design was more elegant.",0
"Please fix the habit section of your app. 1. I can't check the habits in calender view for days other than present. 2. In habit view, the days are fixed and stuck to 7 days that too from taday to last 6 days. I cant check the habits for days other than the days present in the habit view. I really like this app. This app has all the things that i needed. That is why I have took premium for this too. But if this issue is not resolved, I will have to switch to some other to do and habit apps.",0
"was great, but for the last few months the android app is not syncing on my pixel 3. Tasks entered on the pixel appear on the web, but not on the pixel itself - they seem to vanish. Alas, app is no longer useful for me.",0
The app keeps crashing in my Samsung m30s (android). I have sent email and feedback also on this but there has been no resolution. Some of my important items are written in the app but I am unable to access them now. Very disappointed.,0
"App is OK. I use it for some time already. Recently I have discovered Duckduckgo APP Tracking Protection.. And then I discovered how much data TickTick is sending out without my consent. It's contacting Google Firebase and also Bugsnag company. YES. I know it's probably ""aggregated anonymous usage data"" that ""helps you to find bugs and optimize your marketing stuff"". Nevertheless I think users should have some control: like ""help us improve"" setting which is common in other apps.",0
I absolutely adored this app until the most recent update. The task nesting feature is far too sensitive and becoming a real nuisance. I emailed the developers about this issue a week ago and sadly received no response. I'll be cancelling my subscription until this issue is rectified.,0
"I gave up trying to learn how to use this app. It's not intuitive. I can always find a ton of options, except the one I'm always looking for. Plus once I figure something out, I can't remember how to repeat what I did after a couple days. Today I downloaded a different app, and so far, it's a lot more intuitive.",0
Definitely uses 3rd party trackers and do not feel that my data is secured. I was even paying for premium but have uninstalled my app because I do not feel safe. I emailed them a few times to ask about this app tracking and they never responded with an answer. Told me to open an issue within the app. Uninstalled and unsubscribed.,0
"Eh....not great for an expensive app. One of my important tasks went missing. I asked for help but response hasn't produced the lost task yet... UPDATE: Well...a whole lost of undated tasks went missing. I asked for help but months later now, I haven't heard back from them. Since I pay >$30 a year for this, it is doubtful I renew...why pay for something you can't count on or get reasonable assistance. Find something that has a better history of reliability.",0
"Another crappy todo list app I have to delete. I dont understand, all I want is a simple to do list!!! I keep trying to add an item, and it automatically goes into my ""inbox""- whatever that means. I went to the ""help center"" to find a solution, but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless!!!",0
"The appsl was pretty bare bones for my needs. The only reason it's getting 2 stars is 1) everything useful is locked behind a paywall 2) they offered me a free trial, and when I signed up, they took my money straight away.",0
love the app but 2023 wrapped is freezing the app every time i try to go past the second screen.,0
"I was enjoying the app & migrating my tasks from a different app into this one on my windows pc. Windows security alerted me of a potential threat and recommended I ""immediately"" remove app. Detected and deleted ""trojan:script/wacatac.B!ml"" from program files. (ticktick.Ink) Said ""program executes commands from an attacker"" Can someone look into this... I was really enjoying the app though but if this isn't a glitch, it's a serious cyber security issue, given it's also rated ""editor's choice""",0
"I love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task. This app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work. ITS THE REMINDERS. I'm neverrrrr of my tasks. I never get the notifications. I tried everything that was wriiten in the ""reminders not working?"" But it still has not been fixed. Could u please look into it asap",0
"Pros: it has a ton of fancy features. Cons: it has a ton of fancy features. Too many unnecessary stuff. I paid for subscription to try calendar. It's nice. However, setting a task attributes is a frustrating process since they put so many stuff in the menu. It's like instead of manging tasks alone, now you have to manage the app also. They use their web app for subscription to cause you some obstacle to not unsubscribe the service Dear productivity seekers, I would recommend to try Focus To Do.",0
Allowing only 5 habits adds a lot of stress.,0
"Loved TickTick - great interface and the widget was perfect. Unfortunately I had to move on to Todoist. TickTick doesn't have Alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker. For a while, IFTTT and Gmail provided a good workaround, but recent changes to Gmail rendered that functionality inoperable. TickTick, get on board with Alexa and I'll come back.",0
Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.,0
"I really liked a lot of the features but I couldn't get the focus timers on my laptop to play a start and stop sound so I kept working through my break. I went in and gave notification permissions as was suggested. And when I went to cancel there was no place to do so, not even in the play store. But in PayPal it was listed as an active recurring payment.",0
"Used to be great, but so many features are locked behind a paywall it's no longer worth it. I don't mind paying a one-off fee for an app, but a subscription of $30 a year to maintain a to-do list app is highway robbery. I can't even see a calendar view without paying. Not to mention it can be fiddly as hell, and I'm a UX designer... I'm uninstalling.",0
"As it gets more complex, it gets worse. User for 3+ yrs. It has gone from a useful, quick checklist to one begging for integration with email & social media. It now disallows long checklists within a task (e.g., packing list). Free functions I enjoyed are now behind a monthly subscription.",0
Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.,0
"The integration with Microsoft To Do does not continuously sync tasks. It just imports them one time. I use Microsoft To Do to condense and organize tasks from Outlook, Planner and Teams. I would like to have those tasks appear in TickTick as well, just as Outlook records are synchronized with To Do. Can a comprehensive integration be achieved? I submitted an issue about this in the TickTick app. Edit: no reply from TickTick devs.",0
"This WAS a great list app. Then something happened and I stopped getting notifications. I checked the app and it said I needed to allow permissions due to Android 6.0. I've been on Android 7.0+ since I started using the app, but regardless, I checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications. Still didnt work. I've tried resetting the phone, resetting permissions... nothing works. Now I'll try uninstalling it and using something else.",0
"I really love the design and layout of this app but unfortunately the Google Calendar integration isn't very reliable when compared with other apps. For example, if I change the time of something on my calendar it just duplicates the event with the new time in the app and if I delete an event it still shows up most of the time. I've stuck around for over a year hoping it would improve but it doesn't and support often doesn't even respond.",0
"I have been using ticktick for several years but currently having a couple of major issues. As other people have mentioned, I have a Note 8 and for the last month, every time I attend to a notification from Ticktick the app freezes my phone. I uninstalled it and tried other things but nothing seems to work. Sync between the desktop and Android is awful, and customer service is extremely slow at best, usually asking to place a ticket through the app but it never gets anywhere after that...",0
I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...,0
"I paid for the annual membership after trying the free version for a few days because I really wanted it to work, but after trying to use premium for a few days, I realized that this program was packed with features but has an absolutely unintuitive interface. I've tried using it here and there, but it's just frustrating and anxiety inducing. I advise using and loving the free version for at least a month before committing to membership.",0
"Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.",0
"They swapped the Snooze and Complete button, and my muscle memory is not adjusting. There is no way to swap these back. I normally really like this app, even with the occasional giant ""please pay for premium"" pop ups, but the latest update has introduced a random button swap for seemingly no reason and with no way to undo or swap back. This feels so ridiculously minor to complain about and yet it's affected my workflow enough that I may as well learn to use a different app.",0
Can't open tasks with the new update.,0
Cannot actually open (tap on) tasks anymore. The app just shows a transparent background and nothing gets shown.,0
"Please make it possible to get notifications on WearOS watches. Notifications show on the watch, but they don't wake it up (no vibration no sound) so they are basically useless. Any other apps on my phone can do this except for TickTick :(",0
Tasks are not synced in the background. You have to open the app to fetch changes from other devices. That's ridiculous,0
"Overall is a good app, but I'm annoyed by the constant tracking, which is constantly pinging to Google and other trackers, even when I pay for the app. This is not only sketchy but also drains my battery.",0
"Edit: I've rolled back to a previous version. V7.0 looks really nice, but you've broken the app (subtasks flying left and right, randomly deleted). Took less than 5 minutes for 7.0 to turn my perfect little schedule into a beautiful little Picasso. Please, for the future: Your ONE role, before anything else, as a productivity app is to be consistently reliable. Not sexy, etc. All else great, if number ONE is in place. So üôè don't test on your users. You're no video game. Test, test, then launch",0
Hate the latest update. Why did you have to swap positions of snooze and complete buttons in the notifications? I had developed the muscle memory for the complete button. Now I keep pressing the snooze button insted of complete ü§¨,0
After the latest update the app got terrible. The calendar is invisible. You need to check before making updates and changes to your app.,0
Usefulness app,0
"Something's going on with the popup messages with ""Complete"" and ""Snooze"" buttons - they keep swapping places which makes UX super frustrating, so many times I've ""completed"" instead of snoozing!",0
Reminders are now getting removed without my intervention. What's the use of a reminder that gets cleared without being addressed?,0
"Moved the location of the complete button super annoying, not user friendly",0
"Worst update ever! Do developers stop and think about the people that are using the app before they change things? Why swap the completed and the snooze button and change the pop-up all around? Before I didn't even have to look at it to snooze it. It's basically just muscle memory at this point, been using it for so many years. Now since the update I have inadvertently hit complete on dozens of alerts I was trying to snooze. I've had to redo them all several times. What a complete hassle.",0
"Edit: decreased my review because the app has become very slow/unresponsive. I've reported the issue through the app and emailed directly and the issue still hasn't been fixed. I'm using a paid version and this has become very unacceptable. This is the best todo list app I have used. I have set mine up using a modified version of the ""getting things done"" method. I don't pay for many apps but this is one I do. I can share tasks with my SO as well so it makes managing household tasks easier.",0
"The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?",0
"Just like Lynn Olson reported on 10/13/21, I also have a Samsung Note 8 and I had the same problems with freezing up. I last emailed with developer in June 2020, and many times before that. There was never any resolution, so I again uninstalled the app. I wish they would figure this out, since I think this app is better designed than Todoist. I gave 2 stars instead of one for that reason because it's so well designed.",0
"Glitches galore! Currently am unable to see certain options at all, as they are blacked out. Tried deleting & re-installing, resetting phone, & changing the theme to different colors. It's a shame because this is my favorite to-do app & was just thinking about biting the bullet & upgrading. :( If fixed, will definitely reconsider.",0
"Honestly the premium version is just not worth it, what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if, in every case, you can't see future recurring events? (The next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance) In order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next, this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 (as I'm seeing online) and nothing has been done, that not only shows poor hindsight (what's a calendar without planning) but also a strikingly deaf customer service. The app is probably just as good as its free version, the pomodoro timer is ok, but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version.",0
At first it seemed good. I paid a month subscription to try out some of the premium features. The habit tracker is annoying. I'll tick off that I completed one of my habits for the day and the app will still send me 1-3 notifications to complete the habit. Not something I would expect from a paid app. I suggest you add some piece of code that tells the app not to notify the user when they have ticked off their goal.,0
"I'm sure the premium might be fine, but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall. I wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone, but this surely isnt it. At first, it told me I just needed to sign up to do that, so I did, but then it said I needed premium! Very misleading, I immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me.",0
"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into.",0
"I really like the design and would even pay for premium. But what makes it unusable for me is that you cannot sort the Completed Items in lists. So, if you want to buy some item again, you need to search and scroll down the entire list of Completed Items to find it. This is really bothering. Alphabetically would be much faster and make more sense.",0
"Disappointing... I have been happily using this application for years now, but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed. One example: when you create an event that's further away than a month, the app will AT ALL TIMES change the date and time to incorrect ones. It has done this EACH time for me over the last months, changing the dates and times for no reason; you can imagine this is a deal-breaker for a planning app...",0
"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",0
"Had been very good. But now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue. On repeating tasks, sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1, 2, or even 3 days into the future as done, with no pattern behind the glitch. Has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed.",0
"So many great features. I loved this app until I managed to delete a large number of my tasks without realising and no check that that's what I wanted to AND NO way of retrieving them. I can't afford use an app like that. I don't know if using Cloud Sync would have stopped it happening but as syncing is not the same as back up, I doubt it. If they fix this problem, I'll be coming back.",0
Honestly this app is pretty bad. It's hard to use and sells out with promotional adds to buy a premium version and rate it five stars.,0
Their interface is boring and outdated. The tags and other info are at the bottom of the entire window/box on a computer. I use this as a healthcare director and while it's goodz it's not enough. They also don't have support that is responsive nor do they have enough beta slots. Canceling.,0
"Revoke my 5 star rating. Updated to android 14 and even before then, there's been issues. Got a newer update that makes things a bit better but the app is slow to respond most times and almost always ""stops working"" and I have to close app, making it borderline unusable.",0
"Liked it at first, but now that they have made stupid things something that has to be paid for, like the ability to see a whole month, I'm less impressed.",0
Greedy. No one time lifetime payment.,0
"It's okay, too bad you need premium to actually make it useful and calendar out tasks. Best to stick with Google tasks or MS To do list.",0
"This is so helpful, however, recently it has an issue where it keeps on crashing when I'm editing notes which makes me feel like I have to look for another app.",0
"The ""1 min tutorial"" plays LOUD music that does not respond to my volume buttons. I had to kill the app to stop the music. I haven't tried the app yet but this was so annoying I had to comment. For those wondering, there is a 7 day trial and then you are billed $35/year.",0
"At first was excited about TickTick as an alternative to Evernote. But after having spent many hours typing in and editing notes, only to find that they've disappeared a month later, with customer service being completely unresponsive, I'm very disappointed.",0
"Why oh why or WHY does everyone feel the need to rehash a perfectly good interface just to be effin different??? I don't CARE about ""lighter breezier marketingier version""; what I care about is that I now have to retrain my muscle memory just because you had nothing better to do in the new version beyond moving and shifting interface elements around and changing the font just enough to be annoying! I knew updating was a mistake.",0
"Strange bug, repeating event that is on Mon, wed and fri is showing like today, even though today is Sunday. Also no way to backup/restore data without creating an account.",0
"I went back to WorkFlowy because it's simply too slow to work with TickTick in a PC Browser effectively. Other reasons are the limit of 4 sub levels, the occasionally resorting and the disability to stay in focus of a sub task.",0
"After the recent update, on the lock screen ticktick reminders pop up and I can't see what time it is until I deal with the reminders. Super annoying.",0
"Update: The widget show completly wrong stats for your task, also the color of stats in the App and widget are not the same and it make confusion. Disappointing to see this bugs after buying the premium.",0
"It took me a while to realise what was jarring about thi app to me. The app is ugly. There's no design language, every page looks like it was made by a different company. The icons and typography is all over the place. Nothing is consistent.",0
Edit: now crashes often when window is resized! ----- Please let the sidebar be set to appear all the time on large/foldable devices. Good app otherwise but both app and web interface are very resource intensive for what it is.,0
Everything is perfect except one thing: add timers in the watch app. I bought a smart watch thinking I could also track time in my ticktick there but to my utter disappointment that the watch app is the most basic app there is. Add just even a little bit of the functionality from the phone app to the watch app atleast! And to also note I am a subsriber for a year now. I also use the galaxy watch 4. Please add the timers there.,0
"Started fine, deteriorated. Ap has taken itself to default adding a due time to any note added even if one is not wanted resulting in push notifications you also did not ask for but worse than that is incessant warnings the app is not up to date while trying to use it only to be told play store does not have an update while trying to get the latest version.",0
"After the last update, the widget stays empty. this is already now for 3 months. 30/03/24; very often, the home screen widget stays empty after returning out of standby. problem still not fixedüòû 20/02/24; The problem is still there. Very often, when your device comes out of standby/lockscreen, the widget on the home screen is empty, or only shows a few items. While there should be more. Only when you open the app, things are okay.",0
"Fantastic app. With the latest update though, it keeps crashing on me. üòï",0
"use to be a great app, now it just doesn't work. i have missed all my task for last two weeks.",0
"Initially the app worked perfectly. Made my life easier. Suddenly, since past few days, despite ignoring battery optimization, the app doesn't give reminder, and as a result, I have missed out on a few deadlines. The application is failing to serve its most fundamental purpose. Also, didn't know that there is a limit on free tasks. Paying isn't an issue, but 1400 for one year is way too much, that too the tasks aren't unlimited even after paying",0
"After liking the free version, i bought the premium version. but the reminder stopped working. I liked the app because i work on multiple projects and the reminder ringing on the right time is very important. But after buying the premium version the app stopped doing its basic function, ie ringing the reminders or notifications ! I messaged the app through various communication channels, posted the issue on twitter tagging their handle but no use ! really disappointing experience :(",0
"Ok good to know, thanks! It still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock. I'll put some on and it will take them off as I add more.",0
I like the idea. I want to use it. But it's hard to navigate. Improvements can be made. If you are interested I can sit down with you guys,0
"I hate that you have to use Google calander with this. I may as well just use Google calander. Looking for a better planner to replace it, not exist alongside it. Uninstalled.",0
"I like the idea, but it's not working with Outlook calendar properly. This a big drawback for me.",0
"I can't see the pie chart style, just markers in the begginning and in the end of events.",0
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar,0
"Not syncing. No matter what I do, including the steps in FAQs and found online, my Google Calendar isn't syncing with this app.",0
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.,0
"Please make the Wear app an actual app instead of a watch face. I have a different watch face I want to use; I just want to be able to open sectograph, look at it, and close it.",0
I really like how amazing it is on my phone. But I'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch...,0
Not easy to use quite complicated for just adding a lunch break ect. Sets events from your calendar might as well use that instead,0
"Hello Team, I am not able to set different colours for different sectors. Could you please help me show how its done?? I purchased your app in light that It will give me option for above.",0
It would've been better if it had it's own calendar for adding events and other stuff instead of using Google calendar.,0
"I love this app! I can no longer install it on my WearOS watch. The app says ""installing"" on the WearOS play store, but never completes. Please fix this!",0
"I have sync my google task, event's with this app but didn't able to show it on pie chart eventhough I have added widget to home screen. Only watch is shown.",0
"Cool concept, but unusable for Google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and there's no bulk ""deselect all"" button.",0
Can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me. I'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar. Pointless.,0
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.,0
"Buggy! It freezes on the home screen, at times for even a day! To unfreeze it, you need to manually go enter the app.",0
I don't get it.. I bought the pro version and before buying it shows very nice picture how it looks on the smart watch. And? Nothing! I paid for nothing! Such a disappointment. Please explain yourself.,0
"Unfortunately free version no longer can add any calendars, useless as a free app. Was great when it was usable, but no point now.",0
"I have problem with purchasing the pro version. When I click on ""Buy Pro"" button, it says ""Already purchased. Please restart the app"". I have not yet purchased it though, and nothing happens when I restart the app.",0
"i love the ideia but the executation is not good, i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that, this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone, this need a every day reminder, routine and stuff",0
"I like that it now has an in-app calendar, but please make it stop asking to access mine every time I use it. I don't want to have to use my calendars.",0
"After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling.",0
"Reasonably useful but needs more work. To do items have to be created as calendar items in order to appear which is not ideal. Also, why is the iOS version only A$4.49 and the Android version A$12.99?",0
"It's just a widget. They app description made me think it had a lot more features. And don't get me wrong, it might be the best widget I've seen for my calendar. I really think that the description sets the wrong expectations.",0
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments,0
Not a fan - liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder - daily. I started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for i.e 7pm!!!!! -i mean what about task i have for this day ahead!!! i don't need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine - seriouslyü§Æ,0
This is a good app if you don't mind having to put things on your calender. It's just not for me. I don't want things going on my calender. You don't even need this app at all if you have to put things on your calender in order for it to show up on the app. If you don't allow the calender then nothing will show up on the app. It will just go on the calender only. I'll see if I can find an app that I can just put things on the app without it going on my calender.,0
"No graph showing - shows the task sector on phone app, but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted.",0
So nice this is very good,0
It's not showig events in watch Samsung Galaxy watch 4 classic,0
"I like that it now has an in-app calendar, but please make it stop asking to access mine every time I use it. I don't want to have to use my calendars.",0
Horrible to use ...complicated for nothing and just delete everything you write ...don't download,0
"The app worked properly until I couldn't use the function ""Add Reminder"" to set more than one alarm. Please fix it because the app was really wonderful",0
"I REALLY want to try this app. It looks so awesome and helpful, and I must have downloaded it 4-5 different times thinking it might be fixed. Apparently, there's a bug, and the app closes whenever I hit the + (add task button). Please fix this, because the app looks pretty perfect!",0
Best app for maintaining my daily activities. I recommend this to everyone that you can use it .,0
I used to really like this app but now I can't get it to sync to my Google Calendar. I followed the instructions in the FAQ but found them to be written in an unclear way and nothing I tried doing in my phone settings worked to make the calendar sync. If I can get this fixed I'll change my review to 5 stars lol because I really did find it to be helpful when it was functioning properly.,0
App is very good but please add alarm to the events....it will be very useful if you do so,0
"Should be a 1 star but I did like it. So 2. I enjoyed this for the 1sr 12 hours.. then I noticed what should pop up, didn't. What should have an alarm.. didnt... then I woke up today and .... nothing.. everything I spent time doing is gone. Then as I'm trying one more time to add the events and then work changes to sleep.. even changes the time. And it doesn't work for 3rds shift. Lots of bugs, but such a fantastic idea!",0
There should be an option for sharing schedules. A lot of time goes into setting up a timetable. It makes no sense that it then has to be repeated by everyone using the same timetable.,0
Doesn't seem to show the correct time,0
The reminders of my Samsung calendar are not showing on Sectograph (only the events). Any idea how to fix it? Thks,0
"No option for reminders, it doesn't show reminders of my google calendar. And i dont wanna create events for my daily habits LOL",0
"Doesn't work on it's own, you need to link it with another calendar app which is fine if that is what you are looking for but it's not what I wanted.",0
Paid for full version awhile back. I installed it again and it doesn't restore paid version. Please help,0
Doesn't seem to show the correct time,0
App is very good but please add alarm to the events....it will be very useful if you do so,0
"Update 3/8/21: They won't respond to my inquiry. Update 3/3/21: Won't let me change payment method. While trying to do so, I finally got to a link that would allow me to ""manage or cancel my premium membership,"" but the link doesn't work. Evidently, then, I'm not able to cancel if I want to either. I also went to the Help menu, but there's nothing there to help with this either. Works very well and as expected so far. 7 months later: It's still working great.",0
"Sync is broken. Before purchasing the app, I troed this feature and it worked. It does not anymore.",0
Keeps asking for money. I have purchased the premium. But the app shows me only the free version.,0
"There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now",0
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....,0

the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.,0
not exactly useful. was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable.,0
"I did love this, but now I notice it is not syncing with my Google calendar. I have tried lots if things but can't get it to work. I will have to stop using it unless sectograph can tell me how to do it. I' m about to uninstall and reinstall it.",0
"At first I liked it so I wanted to unlock the Pro features, but this can only be done via In-App purchases which means I'd have to pay over and over again for my family group members to have access to Pro. I hope the developers consider releasing a separate Pro version that can be purchased outright and shared with a Family Group.",0
"Only seems to work when connected to Outlook. Not what I wanted, but will work fine ig if youre looking for that. If you dont already use Outlooks calendar this wont be useful to you.",0
"I liked the app and I really wanna put better rate, but I've got a problem with it.. It has been an hour since I downloaded it,yet I couldn't lay my scadule! I wish there is an option to fix the time region, cuz when ever I forgot to set the zone to my zone, everything is missed up and I have to edit every item again, it is frustrating üò¢üò¢üò¢",0
"This app doesn't show all the activities of my Google Calender, so to me the app is quite useless. I even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right. However, the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda, but since it has no use I unfortunately had to delete this app.",0
"This app has a lot of potential, and it is in some real need of polish. It feels like a prototype app, concept works but things are messy (i.e. word wrap, settings). Function is good, I hope the devs work on fashion. Especially the Watch App, it has the potential to be the best watchface there is",0
"Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style.",0
Not in sync with my google account. Bad in regards to automatically getting what I planned and plus I can't use it when i am using my PC!!! But thumbs up for this Sectogragh the idea is brilliant. Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!! It should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on PC. PC is really perfect use for this kind of app!!!,0
"I've was really hopeful this app could work as I really liked the layout + how I can organize my day. But I can't figure out how to get notifications to work...making all my work of planning my day out pointless. It doesn't work even if I make an event with the alert set to '10 minutes before' or 'at time of event'. There's no way to edit notifications within the app or in the notification section in my phones settings, as if they don't even exist. If there's a solution, I would appreciate it!",0
"Update 202207 - taking 2 stars off as I don't see the Dev doing anything anymore. Last update was from 2021. *** I wish the size of the circle is adjustable, even of that's only in the Pro version. I keep downloading the app to my phone's and watches hoping the circle is much bigger already or adjustable and after realising that I still need my glasses every time I look at the watch, I'd uninstall it. A couple of complications would be awesome.",0
"I love the app I used it every day but now it's not been working for a couple of months. It doesn't show the events of my google account, no problem with local events but I want to have everything on the cloud and not have duplicate events offline. The review would easily be 5 stars if this problem wasn't there but I tried everything in the faq and more to solve it and couldn't. Please fix it I want my app back",0
The reminders of my Samsung calendar are not showing on Sectograph (only the events). Any idea how to fix it? Thks,0
There should be an option for sharing schedules. A lot of time goes into setting up a timetable. It makes no sense that it then has to be repeated by everyone using the same timetable.,0
"Should be a 1 star but I did like it. So 2. I enjoyed this for the 1sr 12 hours.. then I noticed what should pop up, didn't. What should have an alarm.. didnt... then I woke up today and .... nothing.. everything I spent time doing is gone. Then as I'm trying one more time to add the events and then work changes to sleep.. even changes the time. And it doesn't work for 3rds shift. Lots of bugs, but such a fantastic idea!",0
"Man I was hopeful. Turns out you can't link Proton Calendar. Bummer. The widget is unresponsive, also bummer. Without those two things, I have no purpose for this app. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I do like the idea and the UI is pretty simple. I paid the subscription fee too. Maybe in the future you'll be able to link Proton Calendar and the widget will be stable, and then I'll gladly use this. Til then...bummer.",0
"Requires you to link your device calendar. Doesn't actually store your schedule, just provides a fancy UI for the calendar for some is the calendar features you're already using. It even opened your existing calendar to create events. I don't want to clutter up my existing calendars, or risk breaking important things, to try this out. It really needs to stand alone unless I choose to integrate with my existing calendar.",0
"I REALLY want to try this app. It looks so awesome and helpful, and I must have downloaded it 4-5 different times thinking it might be fixed. Apparently, there's a bug, and the app closes whenever I hit the + (add task button). Please fix this, because the app looks pretty perfect!",0
"I love this app. Paid for the pro package. Would be 5 stars, but the widget (primary way to interact with the app) refuses to display the current time without manual refresh from me. Have reinstalled twice and whitelisted the app for battery usage, still won't stay current. Hoping for an update to fix this. Nothing else out there like this app (I've definitely looked), or I'd be trying it.",0
The idea for this app is fantastic. But I can not get my Google calendar to show up on the app. I selected it as the calendar to use and when I click on add event it takes me right to the calendar. Once I create an event it does not show up on sectograph. I've waiting 24 hours to see if it was syncing weird but nothing shows up on this app but everything is showing up on my Google calendar. Not sure what I am doing wrong?,0
"It was decent at first, but it stops working completely when I wanted to put a custom time reminder, and it did not sync with my Google calendar. I ended up deleting it :/",0
"Doesn't sync reliably, and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app.",0
It wouldn't let me in,0
"You know, with so many features, it fails at the most essential, simple, basic use case for people like me who struggle with remembering routines. I just want a list that I can check off every day with the stuff I need to do each morning. I don't want the recurring item to show up immediately after I hit complete; I need the satisfaction of having completed them to last more than a friggin second. If Google keep automatically unchecked my stuff in the widget it would be perfect.",0
"Worst update ever! Do developers stop and think about the people that are using the app before they change things? Why swap the completed and the snooze button and change the pop-up all around? Before I didn't even have to look at it to snooze it. It's basically just muscle memory at this point, been using it for so many years. Now since the update I have inadvertently hit complete on dozens of alerts I was trying to snooze. I've had to redo them all several times. What a complete hassle.",0
"Went from good to bad. Recent upgrade to my phone force me to the latest version. I would have to pay all over again. The easy swipe to change list was gone, can't change it back. And worst of all the reminders pop up on top of the screen whether locked or not and I can't do anything else until I clear it. Dug through the settings but couldn't find any fixes. It was a simple to-do list and now it's just a chore. Uninstalling",0
"The PC version is still unusable and the mobile version still struggles. After some use, both seem to get stuck in some kind of processing loop or grind that prevents it from loading tasks and events. Randomly, it will load quickly, other times it will load some and not others for a seemingly random amount of time from minutes to eternity. Another huge headache is the random pop-up of dozens of permanent notifications for far-past uncompleted tasks. Moving events is buggy. I reported all.",0
"I've used this for years and years... Always using inbox display so I can easily rearrange the order of my tasks for the day. However, the newest update has a glitch where, after I arrange my tasks, half of them jump back about a minute later. I'm now handwriting my to-do lists and will switch to a different app if this bug isn't resolved. The app has been great and I am appreciative but please fix this issue. I'll update my review then. Thank you!",0
"running on Android 13 with a pixel 6, the app crashes pretty much every time I start typing a new task or if I assign a data to an existing one, both of which are obviously core functionalities. I've reinstalled, cleared app cache, and contacted support team several times over the past few months with no resolution. what makes this worse is I'm paying for the subscription to unlock certain features that I find helpful and aside from these crashes I do genuinely find the app helpful.",0
"They double billed me for my premium subscription and wont respond to any refund requests. I have been a premium subscriber for over a year, and changed my payment method from Paypal to Google Play subscription, but ended up being billed twice at my renewal (once through each method). I've reached out to their support email address (4 times), and haven't even gotten a response. This app is a good app, but you cannot trust them with your financial information or expect them to respond to you if you have a problem.",0
"1st I want to say, I love this app, I'm a subscriber and have been using for 3 years now. But it really needs to be updated for bugs and issues like that. When I make a checklist, the list ends up deleting items itself, or doesn't update the changes, or the app just crashes. I have the latest version of android. I loved this app and would hate to have to cancel my paid subscription and look for another app, but there are so many bugs and glitches in it that need attention.",0
"I had it installed for about a month, but didn't find it any easier to use than a normal calendar - in fact I missed a few appointments through using it. It's surprisingly easy to do that as for some reason it doesn't show the whole day or make it clear which party of the day you're looking at. Nice idea, just doesn't provide the at-a-glance info I was hoping for.",0
"this was a great idea in theory, but I want a standalone app that doesn't pull calendar data from some other app. for me and for how I wanted to use this app to manage my schedule, this just won't work. I think it could also be more user-friendly. a shame, since this really is an amazing, unique idea. devs, I hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism. I would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar.",0
"The design is on point. However, on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, there is no way to make the automatic (""every 5 minutes"") synchronization work. Sadly, this completely defeats the purpose.",0
"The app would be awesome if it had the ability to add items right from the application without having to enter the information into calendar first. Think items like Gym, lunch time, or any general event/task that someone has in their life but wants to keep just on the sectograph - even better if it has a reoccuring function.",0
Really fantastic concept. There is a bug involving Google calendar events and the septic graph remaining empty. And I do not wish to manually input seven steps per event. 49 steps for seven events... No,0
"When an event is set, it doesn't appear on the clock (as a sector) immediately. The event fetching is very slow. But app is good.",0
Very cool presentation and concept but requires google calendar for events and will not allow you to add events with the app itself. This was redundant to me so I ended up uninstalling,0
"I'm a fan of this, the functions are great however the time has stuffed up recently. I have to double tap all the time for it to show the correct time. Fix it please",0
"The app is good and i liked it a lot, but it consumes a lot of power when u have the widget on. My phone will run out of power within a single day of use. After i uninstalled the app, my phone went back to normal.",0
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock.",0
"Does what it says and has a nice calendar sync function but it is a nightmare of visual clutter, very difficult to comprehend and use at a glance.",0
"The app worked properly until I couldn't use the function ""Add Reminder"" to set more than one alarm. Please fix it because the app was really wonderful",0
"Great concept, love the look amd feel but needs a repeat option for multiple times a day in 1 minute intervals and daily/weekly intervals. Figure that out and I'd buy it!",0
"This nifty take on the personal efficiency problem and the circular, rhythmic nature of time offers a quite beautiful and intuitive way to juggle your day (and drop fewer things?) {They've got THREE ways to support them--pretty cool!) More to say for it when I've tested it in use.",0
"I really like the app. But in spite of adding reminder 10 mins before the event, it's not sending notification. I don't know why. I have added exception to the battery saving too. Otherwise, i would give 5 stars",0
"I'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths? That's not standard and just annoying. Second, why can't I add events from the app? It ALWAYS redirects to Google Calendar, so what is this app even good for? I'll just use my calendar, AND it will be easier......",0
"Events won't show up on the clock after I adjust the time of the event. They show up, and then I change the time and they disappear. So, so frustrating. :( I wanted to save time, not waste it. :( Why? Why?? ? ?? :( Why?? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è :( ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock. Why?",0
"Though it was a great app, and I used it alot for over a year, even payed to show my support to the developer. I seem to have problems after the last update, and i can't use the app, tried everything i could think of. I ttied to reach for support, no answer for more than two weeks, I am little dissapointed.",0
This app is really difficult to navigate and the language used is unnecessarily complicated which hinders the user's ability to use the app. I honestly haven't been able to use the app yet because of how hard it is to navigate but if I am ever able to use the app than I will probably improve my rating.,0
Nothing appears in the widget and in-app doesn't update added calender events. Years later the problem still persists. Maybe i overlooked something in the cluttered tutorial. But so far...the rip-offs of this app work are more user friendly. I'll try again in another four years.,0
"A rather bad clone of owaves (why is it number 1 suggestion). I can't add anything without spamming a google calendar. I don't want to mix this app's activity with ANY account calendar. Blocking calendar permission goes in a loop: ""you failed to grant permission please do"". I don't want to mix every tiny detail from his app into my calendar, that's why I press no. I guess the app has to patronize me that I'm wrong. App is crippled to hell to force you to buy the full version. Just... why?",0
"I love it BUT! To use this app on your smartwatch you have to make it your watchface. I do not want my calendar on my watchface. I'd prefer to have a ""slide"" on phone that I can swipe open to view my daily planner. Or even an app to open. But I do love this app. I'm trying to manage my time better so I will leave this on my phone. Since I cannot use it on my watch I deducted 3 stars for this smartwatch app. I just wish it worked on my watch without taking over my watchface.",0
The app no longer updates it's clock correctly. I'm forced to open the app to see the correct time to be updated. I've been using this app for over two years and it's something that's been introduced in one of the updates that's made the app unable to self update the clock.,0
I have not been able to get this app to work. I bought the upgraded version and that didn't change any of my abilities to sync calendars. Right now it gets a 2/5 stars because it is virtually useless. I will update after I reinstall.,0
"Love the idea but the clock feature is not functioning on my S21 now at all. If there's no solution available I will be uninstalling the app. It's a great setup,and I love the functionality it offers, but if I have to manually update the widget every time I want to look at my schedule it defeats the purpose of the widget being installed at all. Hoping for someone to reach out and give a viable solution, otherwise I will be removing it.",0
"This app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account. P.S. In my Google calendar, the desired calendar has got Sync enabled still the issue exists. P.S. 2- In the My Calenders menu, it is not even showing the second calender which I have made for the same google account.",0
"It only displays my all-day events. I didn't mess with any settings except to link to my Google calendars (I have 2 accounts that are linked to my Google calendar. It displays all day events for both, but not appointments. No idea how to fix it.",0
"Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement",0
"I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this ‚Ä¢could‚Ä¢ be awesome. The design is great.",0
"When I tap on the events (in the widget) to see when they are going to start, it doesn't respond or don't show anything. Everytime I have to first open the sectograph app and then on clicking the events in widget it responds. It is very time consuming app. I mean if we have to open the app every time to see the details of events then what is the benefit of this widget.",0
"Though it was a great app, and I used it alot for over a year, even payed to show my support to the developer. I seem to have problems after the last update, and i can't use the app, tried everything i could think of. I ttied to reach for support, no answer for more than two weeks, I am little dissapointed.",0
"Too complicated for me. Hope the watchface is more simple, like have two version of watchface maybe. First for 0am-12pm and second for 12pm-00am. And there is just one line in the watchface, just to show up the recent time or recent schedule. Today version, have one or two lines or maybe three lines I dont remember it, have grey or hidden area. That confusing enough for me, I must be remember all the function, and sometimes I dont understand the way it works. Make simple, some people will like",0
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...,0
Vidget size doesn't work correctly. It's changing its size from time to time,0
"My Watch won't sync I have a Galaxy watch 5 and no matter what I look at, I couldn't find why it wouldn't sync",0
Not sure if it's working,0
the app is a great app but customer service is terrible!!! I paid for premium service but my app still runs as the basic plan and I've emailed them multiple times and they finally fixed it but once again this month after i was charged again for subscription the app went back to basic plan vs premium. I've emailed them twice and still no response!!!,0
"Drag-and-drop totally unreliable for 3+ months (multiple items would randomly only drag but then stay in old list position), and no way to export if you don't like!

I've input over 1,000 TickTick items, many recurring over a wide variety of dates & folders using OnePlus9 Pro & Key2, waste of time. Would've paid triple if it worked.",0
Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.,0
"This app was working perfectly on my phone. I recently got a Tablet (Samsung A7) and added the app on it and logged in with the same ID. Now its a mess. Few tasks are showing up in the phone while few are on Tab. Logged out and logged in couple of times from both devices. Still didn't work. Another issue is the time. For almost a minute, I am not able to use the app on Phone if I used it on the tab and vice versa. How to get this issue fixed?",0
"I tried it briefly and found it mediocre, no better than competitors or a spreadsheet. I didn't use it for 10 months. Subscription was set up to auto-renew by default, I didn't get any notification of an incoming payment, and after I was charged for an extra year of premium by surprise the company never responded to my request for a refund. I hope my $28 was worth the 1 star review: you earned it.",0
"I uninstalled it. I was hopeful. I thought this would sync with my current calendars, etc... nope. I wanted to used the widget(s), but they either didn't work, loaded a blank widget, or most of them required an upgrade to the premium version. Again, I was hopeful, but turned out completely useless. Uninstalled.",0
"Crashes my phone everytime a notification pops up to ask if I did a task. Shame because I like feature of building a habit but they can't even get this one feature right. This is just a guess but I believe it's because of the second pop-up after you hit ""yes"" to rate your mood. Pretty useless additional feature.",0
"When it works, it might be the best reminder app, but it freezes my phone 20-30 times a day, for upwards of 2-3 minutes, during which you can't use your phone at all. You might have an app you are using (like YouTube) that suddenly can't be stopped (or the volume turned down) while TickTick freezes the phone's user interface.",0
"it was pretty hard to set up a task. I wanted to set a task that would happen tommorow, but I couldnt do it because it was 1 in the morning?? it also was very challenging to set up tasks in general. I couldn't for instance make a task that repeated and set the time of the task. it was also very hard to customize. I usually learn how to use apps very easily. it's like they went out of their way to make it as hard as possible. don't waster your time with this.",0
"As others have noted, the app is now ""asking"" permission to associate you with your personal info on Google, but it won't accept Deny. The request always pops back up half a second later, ad infinitum, making the app effectively unusable. I had to be quick and try multiple times to even open up the Settings to try to make a report through the app, but, of course, the report won't send. I get a message saying ""Something wrong. Please try again later."" So, I'm complaining here instead.",0
"This used to be a 5-star review from a top 10% premium user (by app's metrics). Unfortunately, the app started to fall short on the basics. Some time ago both myself and my wife have stopped getting push notifications from the lists we share. This functionality is super critical for us. Tried all the guidelines with no luck, support hasn't been very helpful yet as well. I'll revert this back to 5-star if the problem is somehow resolved, otherwise I'll have to cancel my plan.",0
"No way to integrate with google assistant on a pixel. It's great app by itself, but unless developers figure out a way to make this happen, this gets one star. At the moment todoist has a work around, but ultimately, im just looking for something that allows me to get thoughts into a task list without needing to search for my phone and get into the app. Sorry devs.",0
"I loved this app. I used it every day. But suddenly it won't share attachments! I get emails with pdf documents attached, and I used to open the pdf and share it with Tick Tick, and the app would be so awesome it would create a new todo with the pdf attached to it. Now not only does the app look different, which is fine, but I can no longer share the pdf files from my email to the app. That was the whole point of using it for me. I'm really unhappy. I also sent feedback through the app.",0
"Great app with lots of features, I even subscribed for the full version. However, I just can't seem to open the app. Whenever I open the app, it closes down. I have to open the app 10-15 times for it to stay open to add my tasks or check my calendar, which just sucks. I'm not sure if this bug is being worked on at the moment but it's definitely making me want to delete the app and get a refund on my subscription.",0
"Overall, the app isn't too difficult to use. I haven't had issues with too many ads. However, once you create/sign-in to your account, YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR LISTS FROM YOUR PHONE. YOU WILL HAVE TO LOG BACK IN EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR LISTS. Due to how often I get logged out of my accounts because of spotty connection areas, this has made this app incredibly annoying to use, enough to dock 4 stars from my original rating. Until this issue is corrected, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP.",0

"An awesome app. Best in field. But expensive at $30+ subscription for EVERY single year that you want to use the premium feature and yet ZERO way to contact developers for support other than a fairly useless ""Help guide"" that has every question under the sun except the one that you need answered. I would expect much more from an app that cost $30+ each and every year!! Very poor, and a pity because its fundamentally a great app.",0
"Hides too much behind the subscription. The day views are an example of this. You'll need to pay each month for the ability to see your data displayed in month, week, 3 day, etc. The app feels broken with all of buttons you can press that nag you to pay monthly for features that should only be paid for once.

The app won't let me login despite having an account. It gives random errors that don't make sense.,0
"Something's going on with the popup messages with ""Complete"" and ""Snooze"" buttons - they keep swapping places which makes UX super frustrating, so many times I've ""completed"" instead of snoozing!",0
Hate the latest update. Why did you have to swap positions of snooze and complete buttons in the notifications? I had developed the muscle memory for the complete button. Now I keep pressing the snooze button insted of complete ü§¨,0

"Despite reporting issues and downloading the updated TickTick app, my powerful phone still experiences frequent freezing and lagging when I use the app. As a premium user, the persisting problems make me reluctant to continue using the app, and uninstallation seems inevitable due to its sluggish performance. It's very sad!",0
"My gf has an iphone and she recommended ticktick as a habit tracker. She actually showed me the app - a milliom of icons, promts, categories, functions, and so on. She paid for her premium. Then i download this app on my android and its nothing but a to do list for $35 a year! Why android users always end up with the short end of the stick?? I couldn't care less about to do list, i want a fully functional habit tracker!!",0
Its buggy .. when i put something for daily .. everytime i check it jump to next day . In a way u cant have daily to do lists that can recreate by itself everyday . Cause if u check them it shows u one from tomorow and if u check that .. it shows from 2 days later . I installed this to overcome procastination . These little things just make it not work properly,0
It would've been better if it had it's own calendar for adding events and other stuff instead of using Google calendar.,0
Not sastified about the features of the premium version. Tried to be refund less than 2 hours after the purchase and Google refused to refund me. Very dissapointed about this purchase.,0
"It is almost impossible to use. The user interface could not possibly been developed by someone who has ever used the application. There is no way the developers have ever tried to use the application. At the very least, they have never listened to the feedback from a single tester that was not a part of the development team. Before you pay for this, try to create a calendar event, give it a start and end time, save it, then try to move it to another day/time. Good luck.",0
"I understand updates so the app works with new devices BUT ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" As others have stated things have been moved, doesn't replace the old version so now I have 2 programs giving notifications, didn't keep the custom notification sounds. Like the program, don't like this update.",0
they swapped around the snooze and complete option even when I press snooze now it completes them and I have to Go back into the app and fix it,0

It's not the first time that theyve responded in nonsensical ways, wasting my time for no reason. I'm a paying member too.",0
The fact that the length of an entry can't be changed from the 1 hour default unless you subscribe to their ridiculously expensive service makes the free version DOA. I'd rather use Google Calendar.,0
"Edit: I've rolled back to a previous version. V7.0 looks really nice, but you've broken the app (subtasks flying left and right, randomly deleted). Took less than 5 minutes for 7.0 to turn my perfect little schedule into a beautiful little Picasso. Please, for the future: Your ONE role, before anything else, as a productivity app is to be consistently reliable. Not sexy, etc. All else great, if number ONE is in place. So üôè don't test on your users. You're no video game. Test, test, then launch",0
Notification does not work. Edited 4/1/24: Notification still does not work on wear OS. Pretty much useless on wear OS if you dont recieve any notication for tasks and due dates. Using Samsung Galaxy watch 6 classic.,0
This app used to be a great until they took some feature to premium such as constant reminder feature....now it sucks cause you miss you reminders because the app doesn't ring constantly it only ring once for two seconds. I've deleted the app now.,0
"Needs an option to set reminders for multiple times a day (ex: taking medicine every 8 hours). The Alexa app even has that option, don't understand why this wouldn't. It seems like it's a very desired option on reddit and many people have suggested, but no update.",0
"It's okay on PC, but the mobile app is brutally slow. Also, marking a task as completed from the notification shade will send your phone to a 1hz refresh rate if you have an LTPO display. It's like nails on a chalkboard after the smooth 120hz.",0
"Always loved this app, solid 5*. But now it changed font settings and the app's font is tiny - even when increasing the font in the app (that changes the list's font, not the app's font). Mind, it also means it doesn't follow my OS font settings because they're larger. So, accessibility fail.. I gave this a 2* review a few days ago, now 1* as the font decreased even further. Now need it at 'extra large' and even then the font is nowhere near large in the body. Rest of app's font is TINY. Absurd.",0
Why my task moves to completed when its done. I mean I get the idea of completed but I want my sub task to stick to section for me to recognise how much of a section is completed. If there are multiple task/section and multiple subtask how can I recognise which sub task belong to which task/section after completion. This is the basic thing...!!!! Would have bought it.,0
"Strange bug, repeating event that is on Mon, wed and fri is showing like today, even though today is Sunday. Also no way to backup/restore data without creating an account.",0
Dislike that you have to add everything to your phones calendar first.,0
"Awesome app! So much attention to details. Bought the paid feature just to support the developers. Thanks Update 02.2021 - unfortunately automatic sync with Office 365 doesn't work for a year now. The Widget is kind of useless without it. Have tried to contact the developer a while ago, but he couldn't help and told me it will be fixed sometime in the future. But nothing has happened yet..",0
Nothing appears in the widget and in-app doesn't update added calender events. Years later the problem still persists. Maybe i overlooked something in the cluttered tutorial. But so far...the rip-offs of this app work are more user friendly. I'll try again in another four years.,0
"Reasonably useful but needs more work. To do items have to be created as calendar items in order to appear which is not ideal. Also, why is the iOS version only A$4.49 and the Android version A$12.99?",0
Love the idea and layout but it won't sync with any of my calendars....,0
"Only seems to work when connected to Outlook. Not what I wanted, but will work fine ig if youre looking for that. If you dont already use Outlooks calendar this wont be useful to you.",0
"I love the app I used it every day but now it's not been working for a couple of months. It doesn't show the events of my google account, no problem with local events but I want to have everything on the cloud and not have duplicate events offline.

"I have sync my google task, event's with this app but didn't able to show it on pie chart eventhough I have added widget to home screen. Only watch is shown.",0
"I did love this, but now I notice it is not syncing with my Google calendar. I have tried lots if things but can't get it to work. I will have to stop using it unless sectograph can tell me how to do it. I' m about to uninstall and reinstall it.",0
Far too complicated for my liking,0
"Not syncing. No matter what I do, including the steps in FAQs and found online, my Google Calendar isn't syncing with this app.",0
"Man I was hopeful. Turns out you can't link Proton Calendar. Bummer. The widget is unresponsive, also bummer. Without those two things, I have no purpose for this app. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I do like the idea and the UI is pretty simple. I paid the subscription fee too. Maybe in the future you'll be able to link Proton Calendar and the widget will be stable, and then I'll gladly use this. Til then...bummer.",0
Really fantastic concept. There is a bug involving Google calendar events and the septic graph remaining empty. And I do not wish to manually input seven steps per event. 49 steps for seven events... No,0
Widget not comming in my home screen please let me know how to add,0
"I love this app. Paid for the pro package. Would be 5 stars, but the widget (primary way to interact with the app) refuses to display the current time without manual refresh from me. Have reinstalled twice and whitelisted the app for battery usage, still won't stay current. Hoping for an update to fix this. Nothing else out there like this app (I've definitely looked), or I'd be trying it.",0
Good idea but it requires many improvements!,0
Confusing....,0
"Unfortunately free version no longer can add any calendars, useless as a free app. Was great when it was usable, but no point now.",0
"Amazing, and the extra features are totally worth the price. Thank you! Edit (5 stars to 2) -- within the last year, the widget has stopped keeping time. That's what it's for, the widget. A clock. Now to see the (accurate) time on the widget, I have to wake it up, kind of. I generally do that by long pressing. This is new, and it's pretty critical. YES, I have checked and double checked the Android settings for this app. It's not sleeping, it's not prevented from running in the background. Et",0
Felt too complicated to use,0
"Great concept, love the look amd feel but needs a repeat option for multiple times a day in 1 minute intervals and daily/weekly intervals. Figure that out and I'd buy it!",0

"It used to works perfectly,but suddenly I have problems synchronizing my calendars... It's empty now",0
"Still need more choice in colours for sectors, eg yellow for work, mint for vacay, teal for exam deadlines, pink for exercise, red for birthdays etc. From my previous review a few things have been fixed: 24hrs shouldn't be extra cost: fixed, can't import from my Google calendar: fixed and too many left and right arrows, confusing: fixed, too few colours for the sectors, needs more work.",0
"I really like the app. But in spite of adding reminder 10 mins before the event, it's not sending notification. I don't know why. I have added exception to the battery saving too. Otherwise, i would give 5 stars",0
It's showing as malicious app on my avg app,0
Paid for full version awhile back. I installed it again and it doesn't restore paid version. Please help,0
"This app has a lot of potential, and it is in some real need of polish. It feels like a prototype app, concept works but things are messy (i.e. word wrap, settings). Function is good, I hope the devs work on fashion. Especially the Watch App, it has the potential to be the best watchface there is",0
"The design is on point. However, on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, there is no way to make the automatic (""every 5 minutes"") synchronization work. Sadly, this completely defeats the purpose.",0
"Sync is broken. Before purchasing the app, I troed this feature and it worked. It does not anymore.",0
Liked the idea. But I had issues syncing so it turns.out it didn't meet my needs,0
Keeps asking for money. I have purchased the premium. But the app shows me only the free version.,0
"It only displays my all-day events. I didn't mess with any settings except to link to my Google calendars (I have 2 accounts that are linked to my Google calendar. It displays all day events for both, but not appointments. No idea how to fix it.",0
Not So User Friendly ...The Interface Is Hard !,0
"Que triste que una app tan prometedora fracase tanto, promete mucho, pero es demasiado dependiente del calendario, lo que hace bastante mal a la app",0
"Please make the Wear app an actual app instead of a watch face. I have a different watch face I want to use; I just want to be able to open sectograph, look at it, and close it.",0
I hope there are ways I cant sync it in on my calendar,0
the app was very confusing and not really that good I hope u do better next time,0
The idea for this app is fantastic. But I can not get my Google calendar to show up on the app. I selected it as the calendar to use and when I click on add event it takes me right to the calendar. Once I create an event it does not show up on sectograph. I've waiting 24 hours to see if it was syncing weird but nothing shows up on this app but everything is showing up on my Google calendar. Not sure what I am doing wrong?,0
"A rather bad clone of owaves (why is it number 1 suggestion). I can't add anything without spamming a google calendar. I don't want to mix this app's activity with ANY account calendar. Blocking calendar permission goes in a loop: ""you failed to grant permission please do"". I don't want to mix every tiny detail from his app into my calendar, that's why I press no. I guess the app has to patronize me that I'm wrong. App is crippled to hell to force you to buy the full version. Just... why?",0
"Too complicated for me. Hope the watchface is more simple, like have two version of watchface maybe. First for 0am-12pm and second for 12pm-00am. And there is just one line in the watchface, just to show up the recent time or recent schedule. Today version, have one or two lines or maybe three lines I dont remember it, have grey or hidden area. That confusing enough for me, I must be remember all the function, and sometimes I dont understand the way it works. Make simple, some people will like",0
This app is really difficult to navigate and the language used is unnecessarily complicated which hinders the user's ability to use the app. I honestly haven't been able to use the app yet because of how hard it is to navigate but if I am ever able to use the app than I will probably improve my rating.,0
I like the idea. I want to use it. But it's hard to navigate. Improvements can be made. If you are interested I can sit down with you guys,0
"I used it for 3 days, but had to uninstall because it doesn't show the entire day. I have to pay for a 24-hour view featured.",0
The app no longer updates it's clock correctly. I'm forced to open the app to see the correct time to be updated. I've been using this app for over two years and it's something that's been introduced in one of the updates that's made the app unable to self update the clock.,0
Colors and syncing issues on the paid version started 2 weeks ago - can you help me resolve please?,0
Setting is very complicated,0
Hard,0
"Buggy! It freezes on the home screen, at times for even a day! To unfreeze it, you need to manually go enter the app.",0
"I'm a fan of this, the functions are great however the time has stuffed up recently. I have to double tap all the time for it to show the correct time. Fix it please",0
"Love the idea but the clock feature is not functioning on my S21 now at all. If there's no solution available I will be uninstalling the app. It's a great setup,and I love the functionality it offers, but if I have to manually update the widget every time I want to look at my schedule it defeats the purpose of the widget being installed at all. Hoping for someone to reach out and give a viable solution, otherwise I will be removing it.",0
"The app is good and i liked it a lot, but it consumes a lot of power when u have the widget on. My phone will run out of power within a single day of use. After i uninstalled the app, my phone went back to normal.",0
"Blech! Yuck colors, Can't operate independent of calendar, phone app not customizable. Just yuck! Wish I could get a refund.",0
Ok I'll wait then,0
"Doesn't work on it's own, you need to link it with another calendar app which is fine if that is what you are looking for but it's not what I wanted.",0
"I've was really hopeful this app could work as I really liked the layout + how I can organize my day. But I can't figure out how to get notifications to work...making all my work of planning my day out pointless. It doesn't work even if I make an event with the alert set to '10 minutes before' or 'at time of event'. There's no way to edit notifications within the app or in the notification section in my phones settings, as if they don't even exist. If there's a solution, I would appreciate it!",0
"The app would be awesome if it had the ability to add items right from the application without having to enter the information into calendar first. Think items like Gym, lunch time, or any general event/task that someone has in their life but wants to keep just on the sectograph - even better if it has a reoccuring function.",0
This is a good app if you don't mind having to put things on your calender. It's just not for me. I don't want things going on my calender. You don't even need this app at all if you have to put things on your calender in order for it to show up on the app. If you don't allow the calender then nothing will show up on the app. It will just go on the calender only. I'll see if I can find an app that I can just put things on the app without it going on my calender.,0
"Update 202207 - taking 2 stars off as I don't see the Dev doing anything anymore. Last update was from 2021. *** I wish the size of the circle is adjustable, even of that's only in the Pro version. I keep downloading the app to my phone's and watches hoping the circle is much bigger already or adjustable and after realising that I still need my glasses every time I look at the watch, I'd uninstall it. A couple of complications would be awesome.",0
Need to improve,0
The clock time not working,0
"I love it BUT! To use this app on your smartwatch you have to make it your watchface. I do not want my calendar on my watchface. I'd prefer to have a ""slide"" on phone that I can swipe open to view my daily planner. Or even an app to open. But I do love this app. I'm trying to manage my time better so I will leave this on my phone. Since I cannot use it on my watch I deducted 3 stars for this smartwatch app. I just wish it worked on my watch without taking over my watchface.",0
VERY GLITCHY!,0
"Transitioned over to Tick Tick from Wunderlist over a year ago and loved it. However in the last few days a new pop up has appeared asking for permission to sync with my Google account. When I press deny it pops up again less than a second later and continues indefinitely. On the rare occasion I was able to access this app I tried to get over to settings and log in a complaint, only to be met with ""something is wrong please try later"" when I hit submit. This is unacceptable, please fix this!",0
Honestly this app is pretty bad. It's hard to use and sells out with promotional adds to buy a premium version and rate it five stars.,0
"I don't understand this app. Have been trying all my best to set it, but it not turning up to my expectation, I wasted money and data to download and buying of pro . No alarm, it just appear on the screen without notification.",0
"Useless app. It doesn't show progress, does not show whether task was completed or not. It uses my Google calendar and what I receive is notification from the calendar. That's all. So what's the point.",0
Why do u have to use external calander app can't i just add stuff in the app itself as it is more easy for the user as my calendar app sucks you could add in app system to add tasks with a simple interface like time and task. Plus I have to add repeatedly the same activities for a whole week or month,0
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. üòï. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless,0
"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.",0
"Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating.",0
Installed and then uninstalled. I simply tried to segment and blocks of my day but was not trying to set event schedules or reminders. I just wanted a visual pie of my daily hour breakdown of where I would be or what I would be doing. That sounds relatively simple but simple was not my experience with the user interface,0
"Seems like a good idea, but I have to enter everything in manually. I don't use Google Calendars. Been using Jorte Calendar for years. It isn't found by looking for local calenders. Shouldn't it be looking for DEFAULT calendar? But I really want to connect this app with productivity apps that have more detailed activity than a simple calendar, such as Time Tune.",0
"it shows you all the features, very helpful and everything and as a final blow... it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase. This is very very misleading for someone who have given their time, signed in with google, synced their events etc. frustrated.",0
I bought the pro version a while back and tried to put it on several different phones since I bought it and I have never been able to get the pro version that I paid for on any other phone again. So eventhough I paid for it I can't no longer use it because I now have a new phone. Horrible and very disappointing.,0
Worked fab until recently then I noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when I went into the app it had the time right. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when I tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise! Very disappointed.,0
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.,0
"It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!",0
tried to make my class schedule and only 1 event saved and showed up in the list for me....everything just disappeared. I kept remaking them and going over the details of each to make sure I got it all filled in correctly and it still didnt work.,0
"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management.",0
"Updated: Still no watch faces in 2023 for Samsung Watch 5 or others. I would pay $5 for a watch face. .....Why even make a program like this if you're not going to have something practical and usable on a daily basis like a digital smartwatch. This app is a 5 min use install for novelty alone. Years after first installing, there are still no watch faces. The potential of this is great but wasted without the addition of digital watch faces.",0
I paid for the updated version and I cant seem to access it even when going into settings üò¢ If anyone else has this issue and or has had it but fixed it I could use the help! I wanna give this app a fair chance before giving a rating. (If I can fix this ill change my rating) üëå,0

I don't use Google calendar or other invasive software and I wanted to try this one out as paper-free replacement for my physical bullet jounral that uses the same 'clock' system. Very disappointed. Why would I need to give it permissions to a calendar, why can't it have local storage ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0
"cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.",0
"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode.",0
"I cannot get it to show the most current events. It is showing me something that starts at 1:30 pm. But nothing else. I sent the events up exactly the same except starts time at 8am and another's at 12:30. They show correctly on my Callender but not on the app. In addition, it will only display one view of the app, not the view that shows how time remaining until the next event. I purchased t h e pro version yesterday. If there is no fix I need a refund please.",0
"Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only. It doesn't even show that any event has been set on the app itself. I was using this app as sort of a time table but if I'm not able to see my plans for the day, then what's the use. Pls fix it",0
"NOT user friendly Words like ""arc"" and ""sector"" are not intuitive words. The ""time between events"" part is a complete mess. Unnecessarily difficult language, for example: ""configuration of arcs between sectors"". What the heck does that even mean?! Then there is an ""event list settings"" with one possible selection of ""striped list""..... If you want to change the language and format of your instructions then message me. I can help you make the instructions far far faaaaaar easier.",0
"Need to about to change the Events colors thank you, other setting has the color plate to select, why is the Events that controlling the whloe widget background but only having 16 colors? And it doesn't shows the color that I chosen... they are not the same color, the magenta shows up light purple... not matching with my phone setting... and my widgets, and I hope there has a setting that can one click and the whole app color hue would be the color I like or choose, I don't like blue.",0
I don't know why I can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly. when I updated the time to wake up at 7.30 am but the app keep displaying I'm to wake up at 6.30am...what's wrong? wasted my time keep trying to update it. This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.,0
I'm so excited when I was installing this app because it looks nice but when I learned that you have to sync it to google calendar.. I need to uninstall this!! I don't want to be bombarded by notifications from my gmail account. Just made a separate app that does everything not relying on other apps. Kinda lazy move from the developers.,0
"What appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen. However the settings doesn't offer that option... Now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up... I liked the idea I could just turn on my phone and bang! the clock would just simply show me my schedule... Idk if it's a bug or just a false promise, either way it's disappointing.",0
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.,0
"The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle. This has potential but make it simple and functional. I was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going. Make it that 7 years old kid can use it.",0
Exactly what i was looking for. But i have to sync it to my calendar? Why? I just want to put in 3 things that repeat every day and thats it. why do i have to sync it to other calendars for that? I cant even make a new event if i havent synced it to another calendar on my device or online? That doesnt make sense.,0
"Was hoping to be able to create a daily schedule with this app, without having to add everything in my own calendar, which would be incredibly annoying. This app just visualizes your calendar events",0
"I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately.",0
"For Daily occuring events it is showing next day event today, this is ridiculous. I have sent emails they didn't respond even though I took pro.",0
"After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go.",0
Couldn't figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour. Also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle. Looking at a regular calendar is still easier.,0
Wanted it because I thought it would display better what's in my calendar. Added an event that was to start 5 hours after the current time. It was not shown in the graph. What do I need it for if it does not show me what's coming up within the next few hours?,0
The app itself is very glitchy and hard to set up. It starts to not work when I set it on repeat and re-edit it.,0
There is an issue in syncing and the events are lost in few mins post adding it. The app could have had their own calendar without syncing to android calendar. Please improvise,0
"It's pure discriminating to have to BUY an extension to be able to use 24-hour mode! Either make it free or let EVERYONE pay for the app! I would love to try this app because it really looks like it has a really nice concept, but since the devs choose to make just SOME people pay for it, then I'll gladly give it a bad review instead..",0
So it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app. It says it does this so you can learn how to use the app. BUT it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo. So it's really hard to tell if I like something if I can't do anything on it. Something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app. Just saying. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm trying to save time.,0
"Good on paper, tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items, wish it had an option to at least input items directly. Either way didnt work",0
"If you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all, then this app is for you. This is NOT a user friendly interface . Does not play well with 9.0 pie (but not much does).",0
No matter what I do I can't get it to look like the images. When I add my work schedule it just shows as a line with a triangle and not a complete wedge as shown in the images.,0
How has this got such high ratings? So difficult to understand. It won't see my Microsoft calendar and insists on linking to Google even though Google lags... half hour later and still no entries. Annoyed as paid for it to try to get it to work.,0
Great idea but doesn't show all events for the day; doesn't show events in designated colours (all look the same); doesn't show repeat events! No use really. I'm removing it from my phone.,0
"installed, looked like what I was looking for, loved the design. but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in, and I HATE the calendar on my phone, thats why I came here... to bad",0
"It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created",0
The point of additional app is to avoid cluttering google calendar with menial tasks. What's the point if I cannot input directly in the app but just sync with other cal.,0
"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?",0
"Not sure how this app received such high ratings. It is just making you add events in your Google calendar to create a pie. I don't want to add daily tasks to my Google calendar. I thought this app was going to be more efficient, but it's not.",0
I wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch. I spent hours trying to get it to work. I emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3.,0
Downloaded because ibthoughtvit would be useful but I haven't been able to manually set events. Seems it had to run off of your calendars. I don't use them.,0
"Doesn't provide accurate time. Even it is 1 to 2 minutes behind the system time after turning on the phone. Later on, it becomes even more slower. 12 hours later it was 40 minutes behind the system time.",0
Honestly would have been perfect if it simply displayed the entire schedule on the circle display. Having to go through hour per hour to see the tasks are a bit ridiculous. Uninstalling because of this.,0
Have tried every thing to get this to synch with my Google calendars that they sugg3sted. Worked for first 2r hrs then suddenly no longer will synch. Beautiful visual concept but disappointed it doesn't work.,0
"I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.",0
Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!,0
"BESTApp ever super useful the only reason for the bad review, is because I already paid for the pro-version of this app because it's that useful*!!..BUT it's very disappointing This app is not supported by my Google watch its not compatible with my Ax Armani connected smart watch please fix ; it would be very useful to see my appointments and errands displayed on my watch. without having to open my phone to view than thanks alot I'll removed the bad feed back onces its fixed- 5 stars!",0
"I just wanted to enter items manually. If constantly asks for calendar permission, and the best part is if you don't grant access then it crashes when you try to add an item.",0
"I wanted to love this app. I read all I could find on it and noted that it used Google calendar to create events. I guess I didn't process just HOW dependent on Google calendar it is. Even the five-star reviews didn't make it seem like such a big deal, so I figured it couldn't be that bad. Other than an appealing look, the app is essentially useless as everything, including notifications, are filtered through Google calendar. I may as well have just used Google and saved my $$. RE: YUP! USELESS.",0
"Shows you everything except for what you look for. I bought premium because I was very interested in a 24 h feature, but it is only available for the widget. The simplest things are constantly being displayed differently all over the app. While you can customise tons of color settings in premium, there is just no sensical priority to what gets shown big. It is difficult to find anything, like just a list of all events put into the app. Cool idea but insanely unintuitive execution.",0
Can you please advice on how to enable only next two pipeline/queued task on the display instead of showing entire thingon the display.,0
In the first place I knew that some apps don't give you notifications when you want a reminder app. But when I used this the notification actually worked the first time I tested out then about 3 days after I put on a reminder task and no notification I went in it into the settings and try to think about how I can fix it and stuff but still no notification so I really don't recommend this app at all or can you guys fix it so it may be better for other users but it was not good for me.,0
"Even though I set a task list to repeat (daily, weekly, monthly) it doesn't present a new checklist with the same content or new reminders. I checked off everything the first week and the due date in the corner changed but every item is still checked off and no new reminders are coming through which defeats the purpose IMO.",0
"I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.",0
"I removed this paid app. I missed about a dozen events over the few months I owned this. I would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up, and it showed that it had missed. I'm trying out Simple Calendar, which testing seems to work better.",0
"Wanted to love it, I like the interface and the categorisation of the tasks but it's yet to actually work. None of the reminders or alarms have actually popped up for me (all app notifications are enabled) whenever I go on and manually check off a task the app stops responding ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0
"This was clunky to use and despite both my wife and I paying for premium it did not share our lists correctly nor was the sync of data completed in a timely manner which could have resulted in something being done twice... cancelled, uninstalled and won't be going back. Much better options available for shared lists.",0
Once quite a decent app has become a mess. Subtasks can be corrupted. Some of subtasks may be overwritten by other ones. You may end up with duplicated entries. Some of subtasks are not getting synchronized. Those who value their data integrity are better to avoid this app,0
I bought the new pixel 8 and this app no longer works. It constantly crashes and doesn't even do notifications. It's a real shame because I really enjoyed this app and now need to find a new one.,0
Just downloaded the app. The calendar only takes just 1/3 of the screen (which is unusual) and there is no option to make it fill up the screen with the entire month. Hopefully you could improve on this. Got a sarky response from the developers! Changed from 2 star to 1 star. Uninstalled the app immediately!,0
"Lost two of my lists and cant seem to get them back ... annoyed. Response to their comment ... well ... two different lists were lost and can't seem to be retrieved. If you are saying that they are Not Lost then there is a flaw in your app when it is easy to ""lose"" lists and then even harder to not be able to get them back ... lol ... just saying.",0
"It stopped syncing after a day of use. Support button doesn't have a valid email address. EDIT: Go to ""Settings->About->Send feedback->Report an issue"" there is the bad email. I think it stopped syncing because I have two Google accounts on my phone, and I removed the one that I was checking on the web, just to be clear, removed from the phone, not the app, since the only way of achieving this would be deleting the account. I think the app should let the user know that it has problems syncing, so it's easier to figure out the problem. EDIT2: Hmmmm... lack of reading comprehension... I'm done... LAST EDIT: Hey developer, I know it must be difficult for you, but try to understand what you are reading.",0
"I was so happy about this app. To my big disappointment, after I lost a lot of time to set my tasks and to prioritize, I had the very unpleasant experience to have all the tasks deleted, also the name of the list and no possibility to recover. I do NOT recommend it.",0
"There is too much going on. I only want a simple reminder app. Only need name of reminder, date and time and a notification with a snooze I can set, this app would be better for me if you could disable attachment, sub tasks, tags, priority, highlight. Would also like to see the date in the reminder fully (Monday 26 December 2022) broken up by 'Today', 'Tomorrow' and so on.",0
"Bad idea to change the game rules while in the game: the game is, as long as this was a free app with the critical feature of allowing local backups (the json file), you don't sneakily remove that with an update (v. 1.3 still worked, I didn't had automatic update on)! Yes I know there is the donation option, but because you didn't warn me before update, you only deserve one star, and I will manually copy almost 400 entries to another app.",0
"Confusing as all hell. A simple diagram explaining the various labels (subtasks, lists, etc) would be very helpful. When first installed and open, it guided me thru adding things. However, when I returned to put in more items, there was no help. So things where I did not want them. Should not have to watch a YouTube video to understand this mess! Save your sanity. The authors reply to this, mentions that most users find this very easy. So therefore, I must be stupid. Good going ...",0
I'm struggling with this app. I'm trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that I want it to do that it doesn't seem to be able to do. 1: It doesn't seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day. Instead I seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that I would have alarms going off all day. That would drive me insane! 2: It isn't possible to contact the developer through the app. Quite bizarre!,0
"If the Mobile screen is off, the reminder doesn't work at all. As soon as you switch on the screen the reminder appears. This is disgusting. How can I always switch on my screen. I also gave all the permissions including accessibility, run in background. Still not working.",0
App is no doubt good but i was using free version of it on one phone. My phone crashed and I had to install the app on other phone. It did not allow me to restore all my important tasks which I had created earlier. That was only option if I buy premium version. I have now lost all my previous reminders and tasks.,0
"Importing data from your old phone is behind a pay wall. Very frustrating, especially since switching to a new phone is stressful enough. I considered financially supporting the app to gain import access, but then I saw the inappropriate responses to negative reviews. I'll find a new app.",0
"Ever since the last update, the app isn't doing right. I go to ""snooze"" a task & it used to clear from the notifications, now it doesn't. And there's 2 ""tasks"" notifications that happens for one task. This is weird.",0
"Keeps closing when I check off a task. Then I get the notification that the app has stopped. This started after I paid for the subscription. I hope that it is not connected. Thank you for the nasty little snarky response to my concern about your app. I understand that this is just a little side hustle for you, but I am not very familiar with the way it works. I didn't know to contact you directly to help me with my problem. But now I don't want to. Thank you for sharing your vitriol with me.",0
"App is not intuitive at all! (and I'm a software engineer of 30+ years!) Created a list, spent 20 minutes adding ""subtasks"" to it, saved it, never saw the subtasks again. Wasted 20 friggan minutes of my life I'll never get back.",0
Have been paying for premium each month for several months now and now it's not syncing across devices and its telling me to upgrade to premuin on both fone and 2nd device when iam paying for premium (pathetic)... Canceling subscription and uninstalling!,0
"Thought this was a great app until I realized it doesn't get rid of the ""checked"" daily tasks to remind you of the new daily tasks... and that is exactly what I was using this for... DAILY tasks I need done. When I check ""remove checked tasks"" it does NOTHING and those checked tasks just stay there. :(",0
"Couldn't get the notifications to stop showing up on my phone lock screen. Edit: the notification is an ""add task"" notification that will not go away after adding a task and will not swipe to clear. There isn't a setting to stop this in the app.",0
"Use Google Tasks! It's much better and FREE ü•≥ You have to subscribe ¬£1.50 a momth to get full use of this ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ It's a basic reminder app. Had it have been a one of payment of a tenner then I'd have brought it but I hate it when you have to subscribe, especially for something so basic as this. They do it so you subscribe and forget about it. Just greed.",0
"Inconvenient, the design is flawed, you should be able to see everything in one screen, I feel it's a lot of clicking and going around just to make a couple lists. I already deleted the app.",0
The persistent alarm doesn't work on my android phone. I only get one notification. Don't put the problem back on me! Shame on you!,0
"I uninstalled the buggy app because it never worked as intended. I am extremely frustrated. Kindly, please do not ask me to send an email for assistance. I prefer using TickTick and Scheduleify apps for my needs. I have lost faith in your app. Having your app on my phone feels like a total waste of storage.",0
"Signed up for premium so I could share to do lists with my colleagues, however all my colleagues also need to be signed up to premium in order to access. What looks like a reasonably priced subscription is actually extortionate once it is at a stage that is worthwhile to use amongst colleagues. Frustrated that I can't get a refund after paying and only using for a few minutes, thankfully only paid a month and not a year as recommended. Other app can do the same job for a fraction of the price.",0
"Hi, Alarms/Notifications sound does not work when on vibration setting. Is there a way to fix this - I would like to get the alarm in that case too .. like the clock alarms!? Edit to clarify: Android phones have a three level setting - ""alarms only(DND)"", "" vibration"" and ""sound"" setting, right? Tasks App alarms and notifications sound works only when your phone is on ""sound"" setting. It does not work on ""vibration"" nor on ""DND"" setting even when ""ignore do not disturb"" setting in Tasks App is on. You just hear nothing.",0
Randomly stopped showing the one calendar that I needed at 4:00 and so now my purchase is pointless.,0
NOW ONLY SYNCS ONE CALENDAR - Great concept but various errors and slow event customisation need to be fixed,0
My Microsoft Exchange Calendar is not syncing on my Samsung Smart watch while it is correctly seen on my Samsung S10 mobile phone. Pls resolve.,0
"It doesn't work at all with automatic rotation on home screen. If I turn my phone sideways and then back to portrait, the widget is tiny.",0
Installed it on my phone for my Pixel 2 watch but it wouldn't transfer events on my calendar the the watch so I uninstalled it but it stayed on my Pixel 8 Pro Phone despite all efforts to get rid of it. I sure don't want to do a factory reset for this malware.,0
"I'm a long time paid user of it. Used to work well and was my first widget on the screen. However, it no longer syncs new events and only shows old events. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing has worked. Have mailed the developer, but received no response.",0
"Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers.",0
"Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.",0
"Horribly confusing, menus got stuck on top of other menus, it puts WAY too much unnecessary visual clutter that makes it hard to focus and figure out what is when. It kept things on the list highlighted long after they were over instead of fading them out... If only it was simplified, maybe a 24 hour clock but with AM/PM designations would be less intimidating than the weird wrap-around thing going on. Just lose all the weird background numbers & triangles so only the events at their hours.",0
"The alarms and notifications don't go off unless your phone is OPEN with the APP open as well and obviously you're not going to be on the app 24/7, it make this thing absolutely worthless. Seriously if I have to check my phone all the time to keep it on and make sure the screen doesn't close or lock AND be on the app ALL the time, then what's the point of even having it?!? At that point sense I'm watching my phone all the time I'll see what time it is and not need the app!!! 0 stars if I could!!",0
"The repeat function doesn't work. I'll tell it to repeat the reminder every 12 hours, but it'll go off once and then never again. Edit: No, I will not waste my time emailing you when there are other apps on the store that actually work as advertised. The fact that you're stalking me on other websites and sending me messages to try and scare me into taking down my review is absolutely pathetic! It's staying right where it is, and I hope everyone sees it and decides not to download your awful app.",0
"Love the configurability, aesthetics, and the features. I strongly dislike the free limit of 3 tags and would happily pay a reasonable one-time payment for the premium app to unlock this alone, but the prices asked are absurd. Also all sync options are locked to premium, which I wholly expect to be free from experience using others. A solid example of one of the worst subscription asks I've ever seen or heard of; this is not a subscription service and there is no good reason to treat it as such.",0
"It is bad , and not useful",0
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all.",0
"EDIT... *Creator leaves condescending, incredibly rude replies on even slightly poor reviews, not just mine. I'd give zero stars if I could.* The most unintuitive thing I've ever used. Directions are scattered and I just wanted to go from start to finish. Things are grouped oddly, behave oddly, get mixed up and have titles that don't really help identify what they are. You should be able to get on there and make a parent list and put stuff on it. It's much more complicated than that.",0
"Mostly works great, but is occasionally glitchy. Sometimes if I miss checking off a daily task, it'll just jump to tomorrow, while others will stay red till checked. The inconsistency can throw me off a little. Edit: Buddy, if you thought a 4 star review with some slight frustration with how it works was ""poor"", you're gonna love the 1 star I'm giving you for this condescending nonsense. Also, for future reference, the auto increment it was off.",0
"Terrible experience. If you forget to acknowledge a recurring task when it reminds you, it will no longer send reminders for that task. Randomly changes ""remind me when due"" selection to ""do not remind me"". In one week, with 4 tasks per day, it has failed to remind me 9 times. Absolutely useless! ETA: AFTER THE DEVELOPERS REPLY, I checked my power saving and HAD NONE ACTIVATED. DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. DO NOT BUY! ETA: Two years later (07/22), still doesn't work.",0
"Terrible initial usage. I was downloading a few different task/list organization apps and this was one that looked promising in the reviews. Unfortunately, if you're just trying to get a feel for the UI and learning how to use the app in the free version, they make the app an infuriating experience. Between the unremoveable/ever-present notification, and the ridiculous number of ads, I now have zero interest in buying this app. I gladly would have. Now, you couldn't pay Me to use it.",0
"The dev is a piece of work. I contacted him with an idea that may be helpful to users about an archive feature, not ""hidden"". Similar to how Google Keep has a drop down menu with an Archive section. Here are two of his statements: ""How you organise yourself is up to you. You can make it messy or keep it organised. The choice is yours."" ""If they are hidden how do you find them again? Hopefully you see the obvious issues here."" Not very professional and frustrating. App=Regret$",0
"Notifications don't work, even with permissions and no battery saving restrictions. My 1 star is more for the Dev's attitude I'm seeing on other reviews. Tends to lash out and seems a bit arrogant. I get you're proud of your work, but grow from criticism and be more professional. Also he blames a lot on the user/phone for legit issues. My tech issue isn't my phone/me, notifications DO NOT WORK. But yea, I can't get behind an app with a dev that's reactive rather than supportive. Never works out",0
Be careful. This app recently started making calls to googleapi and youtubeapi which it never has before. Not sure if the developers were incentivized to or sold the app but this is NOT appreciated. Ensure our data security or we will leave this app in droves just like Wunderlist. I am objecting to and reporting this app. Stop doing sneaky background reporting immediately!,0
"This is kind of funny, I've never written a negative review before. I usually try and look at the positives, but unfortunately I wrote all those down in the Tasks app so they are gone forever. Edit: I'm sure you all take pride in your work, and I understand the frustration my review may have caused. I came in hot; I'll own that. Your app manages personal recordkeeping. If your reply to a frustrated app review is a frustrated review of someone's character, maybe don't get all personal, instead",0
"Too many odd nuances that make the UI a clunky mess. A few changes could make a big impact. It's an almost there product, but just enough issues to make it a no.",0

"Previously rated 5 stars.... but a task & list app that deletes / clears sub-tasks while one is still editing is poor quality control. There are two distinct actions that cause tasks to clear all sub-tasks for an active list that has not been saved and is being worked on: 1. Screen times out or turns off Or 2. Switch from portrait to landscape Both of those can happen for several reasons, and neither should EVER cause tasks to be deleted. These bugs need to be fixed ASAP.",0
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.,0

It doesn't work at all. I added my events and daily plans but nothing happened.,0
Installed and then uninstalled. I simply tried to segment and blocks of my day but was not trying to set event schedules or reminders. I just wanted a visual pie of my daily hour breakdown of where I would be or what I would be doing. That sounds relatively simple but simple was not my experience with the user interface,0
The app itself is very glitchy and hard to set up. It starts to not work when I set it on repeat and re-edit it.,0
I couldn't even edit or add tasks or anything,0
Honestly would have been perfect if it simply displayed the entire schedule on the circle display. Having to go through hour per hour to see the tasks are a bit ridiculous. Uninstalling because of this.,0

I bought the pro version a while back and tried to put it on several different phones since I bought it and I have never been able to get the pro version that I paid for on any other phone again. So eventhough I paid for it I can't no longer use it because I now have a new phone. Horrible and very disappointing.,0

Would love this to work. It says it is working (ticks against my Google calendars). Shows a few. Doesn't show most. Disappointing.,0
The wigit doesn't come with the free version. It does the same thing your Google Calendar can do. I was looking for something for time blocking ... this is time flopping,0
Won't show events I add to it. Makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason. Really annoying.,0

The potential of this is great but wasted without the addition of digital watch faces.",0
Exactly what i was looking for. But i have to sync it to my calendar? Why? I just want to put in 3 things that repeat every day and thats it. why do i have to sync it to other calendars for that? I cant even make a new event if i havent synced it to another calendar on my device or online? That doesnt make sense.,0
Doesn't work,0
Is this app for smart watch???????,0
Is not stand alone. Wants access to my calendar,0
Downloaded because ibthoughtvit would be useful but I haven't been able to manually set events. Seems it had to run off of your calendars. I don't use them.,0

"Can't access sub-list once the list is created I've tried each of the dropping options & I can't find any help section. Initially, the app seemed great. Going back in to edit later has proven to be problematic. Also, reading unfavourable reviews & seeing the responses was an...eye opener.",0
"Developer Steve: Per your request at stating my observations were false or ""mistaken,"" the rating had been adjusted from 4 stars Cheers. 1. Overall excellent. 2. It resets several times throughout the day forcing one to remember what one is already checked off. For some this can defeat the purpose of having a list . 3. The day always changes at midnight. It's fairly easy to work around but if you are in a job where you're typically working very late.....",0
"Looked at the reviews for a solution but The app dev just blames the phone (it's never the same phone) for causing the app not to work. I'm having the same problems of the alarm for a task not going off, not even a notification. Blaming the phone when you so it's not just one device is lazy.",0
"I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars.

This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...",0

I can not do a voice transcript task without being on a network or data. Not cool. I also don't want to Have to give my email to join your app.,0
"Pros: it has a ton of fancy features. Cons: it has a ton of fancy features. Too many unnecessary stuff. I paid for subscription to try calendar. It's nice. However, setting a task attributes is a frustrating process since they put so many stuff in the menu. It's like instead of manging tasks alone, now you have to manage the app also. They use their web app for subscription to cause you some obstacle to not unsubscribe the service Dear productivity seekers, I would recommend to try Focus To Do.",0
Definitely uses 3rd party trackers and do not feel that my data is secured. I was even paying for premium but have uninstalled my app because I do not feel safe. I emailed them a few times to ask about this app tracking and they never responded with an answer. Told me to open an issue within the app. Uninstalled and unsubscribed.,0
The display is simple and user-friendly. There are also known necessary ads which is great. My suggestion is maybe you should add an log in feature so that all data will secured and to linked my data to other device.,0

A bit more of a learning curve than anticipated but all good now. I am rating it lower than the app deserves because I paid for it and it kept nagging me to rate it before I had hardly used it.,0
Most the important features (that make it stand out) are hidden behind a steap pay-wall.,0
"Disliked the fact that they locked weekly and monthly schedule view behind a paywall, would rather just use my phone's in-built calendar app",0
While using application my phone lag,0
"App is OK. I use it for some time already. Recently I have discovered Duckduckgo APP Tracking Protection.. And then I discovered how much data TickTick is sending out without my consent. It's contacting Google Firebase and also Bugsnag company. YES. I know it's probably ""aggregated anonymous usage data"" that ""helps you to find bugs and optimize your marketing stuff"". Nevertheless I think users should have some control: like ""help us improve"" setting which is common in other apps.",0
"Been using this app for a few years. But I notice a weird behaviour after the most recent updates. When I add a new habit, I don't see it added on the habit list anymore. It just disappeared after adding. It must be a bug! Please fix it. I would give 5 star if it's resolved.",0
"App is good, but when you need support, just forget it. Apparently no one is taking care of that part. So maybe better consider some other solution. I subscribed and now that I have an issue I cannot get in touch with anybody!",0
It puts new tasks under old and I can't fix Whoever said its not true let me just say it may not be true for you but still has the newest under the oldest so one of us is wrong and I'm looking right at it. So rather than argue with whomever you are (if developer you could have tried to help me figure out the problem / if individual what makes you think it can't be true when you don't have access to what I see) l'll go ahead and just uninstall.. I was looking for help not to be criticized.,0
At first it seemed good. I paid a month subscription to try out some of the premium features. The habit tracker is annoying. I'll tick off that I completed one of my habits for the day and the app will still send me 1-3 notifications to complete the habit. Not something I would expect from a paid app. I suggest you add some piece of code that tells the app not to notify the user when they have ticked off their goal.,0

It seems like usability doesn't come natural to ticktick any new feature generally gets implemented poorly or are missing basic functions. I can't complete a timer early it won't track it. I cannot set a timer for less than 5 minutes (I should be able to use seconds if I wanted) I cannot use multiple timers at once. timers aren't linked to tasks, they're separate. Smaller apps do timers better, especially Tusk...HOW?",0

"Not sure if it's Oxygen OS that's the issue, but I often don't receive notification reminders. Couldn't get it to work by adjusting battery settings or anything else.",0
"This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall.",0
When I update to mi 14 tick tick don't work What i can do for this .. I will lose my progress??,0
I used to really like this app but now I can't get it to sync to my Google Calendar. I followed the instructions in the FAQ but found them to be written in an unclear way and nothing I tried doing in my phone settings worked to make the calendar sync. If I can get this fixed I'll change my review to 5 stars lol because I really did find it to be helpful when it was functioning properly.,0
I have not been able to get this app to work. I bought the upgraded version and that didn't change any of my abilities to sync calendars. Right now it gets a 2/5 stars because it is virtually useless. I will update after I reinstall.,0
"Keeps closing when I check off a task. Then I get the notification that the app has stopped. This started after I paid for the subscription. I hope that it is not connected. Thank you for the nasty little snarky response to my concern about your app. I understand that this is just a little side hustle for you, but I am not very familiar with the way it works.

The authors reply to this, mentions that most users find this very easy. So therefore, I must be stupid. Good going ...",0
"Inconvenient, the design is flawed, you should be able to see everything in one screen, I feel it's a lot of clicking and going around just to make a couple lists. I already deleted the app.",0
This app has tons of features for managing your work. You can add links to websites and important tasks from an internet article. Easy to use and as sophisticated as you want to get.,0
App not working ....,0
This app is TERRIBLE!! It almost never works in reminding me of the tasks I set reminders for until literally hours later. I do not recommend.,0
I think that the person who is replying to all the negative/constructive feedback is honestly childish. It's like he is mocking and getting all up and arms about them and being ignorant to people. Like he's defensive over the small constructive criticism that is actually good for him to make it better for those who are paying you...if you want anyone to stay you may want to stop being rude and focus on improving what you can and it's not professional at all the way you are treating them...,0

Disappointed with ticktick windows app. windows app is buggy.,0
Notifications/reminders are not showing on lock screen after recent update (Samsung f62 Android).,0
To be honest it is a great app. All of the features are great. Very helpful. But the reason I give the 2 star is that it only allow me to make 5/6 list!! I khow you will tell me give the premium. But I will tell that you should at least give some flexibility in this place. If i can't make some of the lists then why should i use this application!!,0
Latest versions are laggy,0

"As it gets more complex, it gets worse. User for 3+ yrs. It has gone from a useful, quick checklist to one begging for integration with email & social media. It now disallows long checklists within a task (e.g., packing list). Free functions I enjoyed are now behind a monthly subscription.",0

"So many great features. I loved this app until I managed to delete a large number of my tasks without realising and no check that that's what I wanted to AND NO way of retrieving them. I can't afford use an app like that. I don't know if using Cloud Sync would have stopped it happening but as syncing is not the same as back up, I doubt it.

It's a bit of a mess for something that's supposed to be simple and straightforward,0
"The ""1 min tutorial"" plays LOUD music that does not respond to my volume buttons. I had to kill the app to stop the music. I haven't tried the app yet but this was so annoying I had to comment. For those wondering, there is a 7 day trial and then you are billed $35/year.",0
"At first was excited about TickTick as an alternative to Evernote. But after having spent many hours typing in and editing notes, only to find that they've disappeared a month later, with customer service being completely unresponsive, I'm very disappointed.",0
"Update: The widget show completly wrong stats for your task, also the color of stats in the App and widget are not the same and it make confusion. Disappointing to see this bugs after buying the premium.",0
Need paid version for month view? I understand we all want to make money but that's like taxing looking at pictures lmao. Plenty of other apps out there.,0
"It took me a while to realise what was jarring about thi app to me. The app is ugly. There's no design language, every page looks like it was made by a different company. The icons and typography is all over the place. Nothing is consistent.",0

"After the recent update, on the lock screen ticktick reminders pop up and I can't see what time it is until I deal with the reminders. Super annoying.",0
"Liked it at first, but now that they have made stupid things something that has to be paid for, like the ability to see a whole month, I'm less impressed.",0
"It's okay, too bad you need premium to actually make it useful and calendar out tasks. Best to stick with Google tasks or MS To do list.",0
"The appsl was pretty bare bones for my needs. The only reason it's getting 2 stars is 1) everything useful is locked behind a paywall 2) they offered me a free trial, and when I signed up, they took my money straight away.",0
Edit: now crashes often when window is resized! ----- Please let the sidebar be set to appear all the time on large/foldable devices. Good app otherwise but both app and web interface are very resource intensive for what it is.,0
"I went back to WorkFlowy because it's simply too slow to work with TickTick in a PC Browser effectively. Other reasons are the limit of 4 sub levels, the occasionally resorting and the disability to stay in focus of a sub task.",0
It was a great app but after the latest versions there is a lot of problems in the app and the biggest one is that i can't log in with my google's account or facebook's account,0
not working well on my miui phone often misses notifications,0
"A new version is worse, more uncomfortable and doesn't work properly!!!",0
"They swapped the Snooze and Complete button, and my muscle memory is not adjusting. There is no way to swap these back. I normally really like this app, even with the occasional giant ""please pay for premium"" pop ups, but the latest update has introduced a random button swap for seemingly no reason and with no way to undo or swap back. This feels so ridiculously minor to complain about and yet it's affected my workflow enough that I may as well learn to use a different app.",0
Something this app is doing is hijacking the alarm notification tray tile in Android 13. It should open the Clock app but it instead opens a TickTick Habit.,0
"I really liked a lot of the features but I couldn't get the focus timers on my laptop to play a start and stop sound so I kept working through my break. I went in and gave notification permissions as was suggested. And when I went to cancel there was no place to do so, not even in the play store.

"There is too much going on. I only want a simple reminder app. Only need name of reminder, date and time and a notification with a snooze I can set, this app would be better for me if you could disable attachment, sub tasks, tags, priority, highlight. Would also like to see the date in the reminder fully (Monday 26 December 2022) broken up by 'Today', 'Tomorrow' and so on.",0
"The widget doesn't check or scorethrough when you tick the box from the widget, it just sends it to the bottom of the list and leaves it present and unchecked as if you haven't completed it yet. This is with ""show completed"" setting being OFF too. So can't tell what's been done or not.",0
Not very intuitive. Used for years and still not sure how to backup online or if that is even possible.,0
"Needs lot of improvents UX wise 1. If the all the lists are only accessible from the menu which only shows up in the first tab why not make that on the bottom bar like evernote, todoist, google tasks, etc 2. Also, Note editor is not good..it is buggy. Note flickers when scrolling Plus, that shortcut to make note bold, italics etc are very annoying. Copying the note to google docs is so hard because of those ""*"" and ""#"" which also get copied and the format also changes",0
Notification not coming on galaxy watch four please update,0
Reminders don't work..can't rely on it,0
"This is a good app and it's premium subscription is helpful for me. However, the main page as well as it's widgets show today's overdue tasks in blue rather than in red. If a task is overdue by 2hrs, then that should be shown in overdue list and not today list. Same with widgets, there should be another filter to display only overdue tasks even if they are only overdue by 2hrs and future tasks should not get displayed in the list. Hence I am reducing the number of stars in my review.",0
No widget,0
Sadly i could open this app only once when i first installed it and but since then it keeps crashing like there is no tomorrow. Probably could be something to do with me being on AOSP rom,0
Notification does not work,0
An improvement would be to not collect data on paying customers. Great idea of having the Eisenhower matrix. Would be worth buying if connected to Google calendar.,0

I submitted an issue about this in the TickTick app. Edit: no reply from TickTick devs.",0
Their interface is boring and outdated. The tags and other info are at the bottom of the entire window/box on a computer. I use this as a healthcare director and while it's goodz it's not enough. They also don't have support that is responsive nor do they have enough beta slots. Canceling.,0

"I paid for the annual membership after trying the free version for a few days because I really wanted it to work, but after trying to use premium for a few days, I realized that this program was packed with features but has an absolutely unintuitive interface. I've tried using it here and there, but it's just frustrating and anxiety inducing. I advise using and loving the free version for at least a month before committing to membership.",0
Ugly,0
This app has tons of features for managing your work. You can add links to websites and important tasks from an internet article. Easy to use and as sophisticated as you want to get.,0
"Update: Consider creating a widget for this application as I originally commented that this app seldom reminds me, likely since it has to be opened and running to do so. A widget should resolve this issue.",0
ive tried this app 2 times. Its great but everytime i use it it installs pop up adds all over my phone. As soon as I go to open one app their is an add...not cool. I deleted it for the 3 and final time.,0
Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.,0
"First I thought it was a 5 star app, but then it would not let me change names of lists, so I dropped my rating to 4 stars, and then it would not let me add new lists, so I dropped my rating to 3 stars and then it would not let me delete lists, do I dropped my rating to 2 stars, and then it would not let me move items between lists, so I dropped my rating to 1 star. Besides all that it seems like a nice app.",0
Can't restore your backed up tasks on your new phone unless you pay for the premium version. Nowhere in the description does it state that.,0
"I actually only downloaded the app to put a message out there for the developer and to potential users. No app is perfect. There are ALWAYS going to be suggestions for improvement and subsequent lower than 5-star ratings. People have a RIGHT to give their honest reviews. This developer seems to only want 5-star ratings and if he doesn't get them, he tries to shame people for their honest reviews. Not the best way to do business.",0
I have tried this app a few times. It's garbage. I have yet to be able to use the lists. Can't find notes for a tasks.,0
"after few months it started not checking the task. I mean I check and few hours later it is unchecked. it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed, example: task 1 to date 01/jan/2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01/feb/2019. after checking the task for January the task for February should be displayed, but after some time the task for January is unchecked.",0
I hav installed just a day ago and you see how when I set alarm for today it didn't even work and ring üòë... It's just a normal app with no alarm..I hate this app üòë,0
Can't rely for reminders. No alarm comes even if I select Alarm. Because of relying on this app I missed an important task.,0
"It does'nt work at all. No alarm,no notification nothing at all even after going thru all the settings. Just wonder how your app get its 4.7 rating.",0
Nope doesn't work for me. Don't like the format or structure. Too restrictive. You have to fit yourself to this app rather than have it fit your needs.,0

"Need offline apps. Looked for offline apps. Thought this was an offline app. It's not, so bye-bye!",0
Rubbish,0
Complex,0
"The dev is a piece of work. I contacted him with an idea that may be helpful to users about an archive feature, not ""hidden"". Similar to how Google Keep has a drop down menu with an Archive section. Here are two of his statements: ""How you organise yourself is up to you. You can make it messy or keep it organised. The choice is yours."" ""If they are hidden how do you find them again? Hopefully you see the obvious issues here."" Not very professional and frustrating. App=Regret$",0
"This is kind of funny, I've never written a negative review before. I usually try and look at the positives, but unfortunately I wrote all those down in the Tasks app so they are gone forever. Edit: I'm sure you all take pride in your work, and I understand the frustration my review may have caused. I came in hot; I'll own that. Your app manages personal recordkeeping. If your reply to a frustrated app review is a frustrated review of someone's character, maybe don't get all personal, instead",0
"Notifications don't work, even with permissions and no battery saving restrictions. My 1 star is more for the Dev's attitude I'm seeing on other reviews. Tends to lash out and seems a bit arrogant. I get you're proud of your work, but grow from criticism and be more professional. Also he blames a lot on the user/phone for legit issues. My tech issue isn't my phone/me, notifications DO NOT WORK. But yea, I can't get behind an app with a dev that's reactive rather than supportive. Never works out",0
Be careful. This app recently started making calls to googleapi and youtubeapi which it never has before. Not sure if the developers were incentivized to or sold the app but this is NOT appreciated. Ensure our data security or we will leave this app in droves just like Wunderlist. I am objecting to and reporting this app. Stop doing sneaky background reporting immediately!,0
"The alarms and notifications don't go off unless your phone is OPEN with the APP open as well and obviously you're not going to be on the app 24/7, it make this thing absolutely worthless. Seriously if I have to check my phone all the time to keep it on and make sure the screen doesn't close or lock AND be on the app ALL the time, then what's the point of even having it?!? At that point sense I'm watching my phone all the time I'll see what time it is and not need the app!!! 0 stars if I could!!",0
Too hard to figure out,0

"The repeat function doesn't work. I'll tell it to repeat the reminder every 12 hours, but it'll go off once and then never again. Edit: No, I will not waste my time emailing you when there are other apps on the store that actually work as advertised. The fact that you're stalking me on other websites and sending me messages to try and scare me into taking down my review is absolutely pathetic! It's staying right where it is, and I hope everyone sees it and decides not to download your awful app.",0
Junk,0
"Has no sign in option only export and the file won't open, so unless you have an IT friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff I put in tasks has gotten lost. If the developer revolves this is I will edit this review.",0

App is very buggy. Completed tasks keep showing up as not completed. Notification alarm won't work. Uninstalling.,0
it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks. guess there is bug who can't handle long task list. not recommending.,0
"This app is ridiculous. You can't delete tasks, move the sub tasks around, modify, or makes notes as the project evolves. It's not intuitive. Essentially I had to write out my list on a piece of paper to build the order. Once it was correct then enter it to this app, which makes this app pointless. Must be the free version's nuisance features driving you towards the paid version.",0
"Needlessly compicated for a to do list app. try to add a new item to your list and youll accidentally add a new list. try to swipe to switch between lists and youll remove an item from your list. What did you just remove? Hard to say, cant seem to find an undo option among the numerous other options.",0

Well it's broken now. I haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm. It just vibrates. I checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder. Why do these reminder apps always break?,0
"Developer Steve: Per your request at stating my observations were false or ""mistaken,"" the rating had been adjusted from 4 stars Cheers. 1. Overall excellent. 2. It resets several times throughout the day forcing one to remember what one is already checked off. For some this can defeat the purpose of having a list . 3. The day always changes at midnight. It's fairly easy to work around but if you are in a job where you're typically working very late.....",0
"at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority don't even showed me, if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking... sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i don't have iphone anymore so? came on please make this one work",0
Sir plzzz ad some more option like Upcoming task and DONE TASK SO THAT I CAN SEE ALL DETAIL ABOUT MY UPCOMING PROJECT AND HISTORY IN SEPRATE OPTIONS OBOUT THIS And add repeat option until i will not stop or snooz the task Some time i m not able to see my mob.

"## You ""reaching out"" has not, in any way, addressed the question I asked, I'll uninstall. Thanks anyway. ## * Rather disingenuous response.

"I gave this app a higher review, 4 stars, then the developer commented why not five? I politely responded via email that I think there is always room for improvement. I then got a very long winded passive agressive email about how I'm dragging his app down and I should really appreciate his many hours of hard work more. About how I'm basically making it easier for big corporations to over shadow him. Apparently for Steve the customer is not only not always right, but actively wrong.",0

I think there are a few things it's missing, one I think they should add some way to link it to your contacts, and or maybe it's own form of contacts, if it can't be linked. Another thing I think should be added, is a way to Link your emails, So you could just view them from the app, or have it's own email system. Lastly a way to organize, and add files/photos, add them to specific dates.",1
"Easy to interface with option to add details if require, thanks",1
"The name of the app is a little misconceiving. This is NOT the ""Pro"" version. You'll get asked repetitvely to upgrade to the pro version. But I still give ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© because it does it's job well. + you don't get bombarded with a bunch of random ads. They only periodically ask you to pay for the premium/pro version.",1

"I prefer an andoid phone (that may change at some point, lol) and I have this on my phone and am in the process of installing it onto my laptop. I have used it for over a year and LOVE it. I have tried several different apps before finding this one and hope it is always available to me. Have had ZERO issues with it so far. THANK YOU developers for a tremendous product that does exactly what its supposed to do!",1
Notifications are not sent to remind me of my tasks deadline.,1
Hubby and I are able to share our calendar appointments! I am the one who enters all the Dr appt and medical care along with birthdays.,1
"Very good app for planning my studying and care of my pets! The only thing is that you have to pay for premium to have a reoccurring task, but I don't really mind because I will just manually repeat all my tasks! Other than that it is amazing!!!",1
I would like to be able to import my contacts to it. I would give 5 stars for that.. Can't import photos,1
Love this app and how easy it is to use. It has features that work for my family unit real well. I wish I could use more without having to pay for the subscription.,1
Need to have broader range of selection for repeat tasks such as repeat every third Tuesday or every last Tuesday month,1
Good,1
Greatly improved comment from me. MUCH better than when I started using 2+yrs ago. Most updated lead to improvement. Only concern - The weekly widget becomes unseeable sometimes. It's there but all the text/lines become black & I always use dark screens.,1
"It really could use more functions like an alarm or a scratch off for events completed just like task. However, it's still useful in keeping track of things needed done through out the day.",1
Useful and simple. I like how it has notes and tasks as well as events.,1
"I like this app!! It's easy to use and economical. It has good widgets. I like the Weekly Calendar widget and the Task Widget a lot. One thing I would request is to have a Notes widget, please. Then it will be absolutely perfect! Thank you for creating this !",1
"Very close to the Franklin Covey Planner, but less expensive. I get the Franklin Planner experience without the cost. The main advantage is that I don't have to carry that large binder!",1
Keeps me organized right at the top of my fingures and very memorable have photos added.,1
A very useful app when trying study and to get things done and in time.,1
Like it easy to use.,1
"I tried about 15 task manager apps and this is the only one that has a useful functioning prioritization of tasks. Prioritizing A1-A99 through C1-C99, along with dates and times. I used a Franklin planner software on my Palm pilot 20+ years ago, and this is the closest I've seen to it in all the years I've been searching. All the others (including Microsoft and Google's products) are garbage. The only point against it is the widget doesn't show very many rows.",1
Excellent in parts. A project management feature would be ideal as I thought that's what the projects folder was but it's just another folder for tasks. Would prefer if the monthly view wasn't just little dots on the days and you could get some information from them at a glance. Widgets are very good and look well. Pulling from other calendars and different devices isn't as seamless as it should be. I had to download Google Calendar for it to work 90% (phone to tablet but not vice versa),1
Great app !! love that timed reminders can be set multiple times. Great if you work with color coding schedule. A must for proper time management . Love the option of checking off tasks completed.,1
"I have been using Planner Pro for several years . I absolutely love it. Its simplicity, the task list carrying over each day and the overall functionality suits my needs for managing my daily tasks and events.",1
I Love the ability to prioritize your lists and put due dates. You can also do reoccurring tasks. So far it's my favorite app that I've tried and I've tried several.,1
"Planner Pro is awesome for reminding you of those things that we may get too busy during the day to remember. It's like a ribbon around your finger to remind you to make a business call, shopping lists, etc., etc. Keep up the great work!",1
"Best planner out there! I love the ability to take notes, journal, track projects, schedule events and to-dos all in one place. Excellent!!!",1
Keeps me on track with my appointments! Great app!!,1
This Planner Pro is exactly what's needed to keep me on track of my daily activities. Easy to use. Reminds me of each upcoming event. No longer rely on paper generated planners. Highly recommend. No change in my original rating.,1
Simple. Easy to use. Serves my dIly planning perfectly.,1
"Love it, wish the notes were better and supported s pen",1
The best digital planner I've ever used. I like it because it's integrated and can be used across devices. Easy to use as well. Highly recommended!,1
I love the way it is organized and puts equal emphasis on project management and time management.,1
Fantastic and easy to use,1
"clean, easy-to-use, dark mode.. not bad",1
I love this app. It syncs on my phone and tablet!!,1
"Extreme useful, love that you can share the diary. Simple and straight forward. And no annoying notifications. So far faultless",1
Best app ever!!! It helps my productivity immensely.,1
"Planner Pro helps enhance my organization and productivity! I especially love that I can add tasks, events, and notes. The features and layout are very clear and accessible. This app helps motivate me to plan.",1
Easy to use and versatile.,1
"Super useful tool that integrates with pre-existing calendar info you have. Allows you to coehesively plan your day to day tasks and worklife in the priority you determine. Notes, dates, appts., calendar, tasks, projects; this is really an all in one!!! After 2 days of use, I bought the lifetime one time purchase. Cheap, worth it!",1
"I love it. Easy to use. Make my life organize. I love the way I can put photos, location and description in my notes. Tasks are good. And I love that I can chose diferent colour for events.",1
"I am a Franklin Covey planner user and I finally found an app to replace the basic functionality here on my phone. Great app and worth the full price to eliminate advertisements. It also syncs with my Microsoft family calendar, and Samsung and Google calendars.",1
"The Organizer I'm looking for. It has tasks, events and notes and user interface is simple yet comfortable. I hope it can be opened in web someday.",1
"Not the best but helpful for the majority members. Most recommended for this category. Lastly thank you to the developers, from my opinion: all tasks must be achieved by the initial deadline, any postpone mustn't be allowed. If we the users achieve all the deadlines, there will be a reward with 10% off on monthly/yearly membership, etc.... once again thank you....",1
"This is my go to planner app. I've never been disappointed except, I have the pro version which I purchased years ago and there is an annoying banner asking me to purchase the pro version which is the one I'm currently using.",1
"So far it's exactly what I'm looking for! My short term memory is shot, this app send me reminders of my daily tasks and syncs to my calander so I have everything in one place.",1
I love this planner. Helps keep all of my life organized. some other digital planners don't offer notifications and/or reminders ... this one does!,1
Easy to use and caters to all my needs. Love the tick boxes - this motivates me daily to do all on my to do list.,1
So far this planner has been great. I like the ease of use and that I can color code my stuff. I also like how it inergrates with my Google calendar,1
"In any ways just another Calander, everything is just fine that way but when you add in the notes with photos, this really doubles as a fantastic journal as well. I love the searchability.",1
"I am loving this app! My organisational skills have certainly waned in recent years but this app is keeping me on track where many apps have failed before! As soon as I started using the app I knew this was exceptional, so much so that I bought the life access immediately! It's that good!",1
I've been searching for a digital planner for a long time and haven't found one that I liked until now. I've just started using Planner Pro and so far I'm loving it. It's perfect for my personal and business use.,1
Love this app which connects to my Google calendar. To do list and calendar visible to give you an overview of your day. Easy to use and syncs between my ipad and chromebook.,1
"Has everything I need in one place in terms of notes, to do lists, and scheduling! Plus it syncs across all my devices!",1
"Most perfect planner ever! User friendly with daily, weekly and monthly views, tasks and notes. I have it on my phone, so my calendar is always with me and I can take notes.",1
Love this app. I've been looking for something that looks and feels like a physical calendar book but for my phone to maximize my productivity. This hits the spot. It is simple and gets the job done.,1
This is an amazing app for planning all of my stuff. It is so easy to put something on my schedule it takes like twenty seconds to add anything like a reminder or a new task. It is just a really nice app to use.,1
I have used this App for years now and really find it helpful. I like that it is synched to my email and also the fact that it is very easy to use. It also doesn't have any adds so there are no interruptions when in use.,1
"I've been loving this app, its pretty similar to google calendar but with a notes page and rollover tasks to the next day. You can see what you've done in the days b4 and what you need to finish up the next. I love the format",1
Supper easy to use and having everything simply organized with task and addition notes helps me stay on top of things. Only thing I wish the app had was more customizable colors and icons for event management.,1
"Simple easy to use, great product. Definitely would think about buying the ad free version if i start using this more.",1
"I love your app. But it is not support on window, it can not edit the motto daily, because I would like to add my targets in my everyday in order to remind my mind. Another suggest, it should have tags in note, easy to find my note or add folder for this note",1
The best cash manager here in PlayStore. Very easy and very convenient to use.Backing up of files for the purpose of changing phones is super easy too.Hoping to have this one on Apple Appstore also.,1
"Clean UI and the developers are very helpful and were very quick to respond to my inquries. Thanks a lot. I hope they will never abandon the app, coz I just bought the lifetime subscription.",1
I've been looking for a planner like this for years. Would be good if there are more integrations with other note taking apps and has handwriting function too.,1
"Good Job üëç! The app is a whole lot better than we I first had it. Now it acts more like a Planner so I don't need to deal with the book form of a planner. I wish that you can add Goal Setting, like in a planner. This is now my one-stop shop for planner my day-to-day life. I even convinced my Sister to let go of the paper planner and switch to the Planner Pro.üôÇ",1
"This app is really good, i use it to manage Events like my friends birthdays and other events. Its really good, i totally recommend, my friends love it too, i am very disorganized so this helps me a lote, i think it would be good for everyday use!! 5 stars from me!!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",1
"I used a Franklin Planner, this is a great alternative to going the digital route. This is used daily for me in taking notes troughout the day and setting up tasks that need completed.",1
"This has been a really good app to help me stay organized, I love being able to have my itenerary Imy tashall in one view. The only down side is that it doesn't connect my account on my word Andriod devices to my personal apple devices. Although I was able to work around that.",1
"I was prompted (begrudgingly) to download this app because the 1 I had been using for years was apparently ""not safe"" anymore for privacy reasons. After about 10-15 min of using Planner Pro, however, I was pleasantly surprised! This app actually has more options than my last, making organization efficient & fun. Yes, if you enjoy organizing your daily, weekly, monthly lives this app is for you. Easy to use with simplified actions & alphabetical, numerical ladders. I would recommend it to anyone!",1
Great for what it does. Any number of ca!anders that you can add event meetings etc to and add notes as well as tasks. Simple to use. Not complicated. Just like the old paper diary.,1
This app is absolutely amazing! It helps me keep track of all things going on in my life. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who's overly busy or to anyone who just needs a reminder when an appointment is or something along them lines! Thank you planner pro for such an amazing app!,1
"I installed many notes, planner app but still app is for me the best, no annoying ads, they continue to add features.. will purchase pro version for unlimited photo upload and project creations.",1
"As a FranklinCovey consultant for 23 years, I can arrest that this is the most faithful app I have ever seen if you're a former planner user. It also ticks all the boxes for me as a digital tool, like recurring tasks and recorded notes. In addition there is dark mode which is a must for my waning eyesight. I'm thrilled with this tool.",1
"Great app But it forces you to sign in to something to use it, which is garbage. You should be able to use this without signing in. Backup and restore doesn't have to be via online accounts only, it can be ""export to file"" thing, which I preffer 100% of the time. Edit: I tried it again, and we can now use it without an account, great work!",1
"I've only been using the app for 5 days, but I love it! I've been using a Franklin copy planner for 3 years and I love the concept behind the Franklin planner, however it's so bulky to carry around. And the ease of opening the app on my phone is wonderful. It has almost every single feature that the Franklin planner does.",1
"I absolutely love this app. I'm a college student and this really helps me organize my college life, my things from home and work. It's user friendly. You can add repeated event like my classes for the rest of the semester, add tasks for the week, month, and year. You can get a notification for events and tasks, prioritize tasks, and you can have them in different colors. I do wish they had more colors for the events and tasks. I payed for the annual fee and honestly, this is the best planner!",1
"Can't get iPad and Android to sync info. As I read through reviews this seems to have been an issue for years now so I doubt it will be fixed. This syncing issue is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. It's otherwise a great app but damn I have 32 more tasks on my IPad vs my Android and the calendars do not sync at all since it will only sync off of IOS, which does not help me and makes the android version virtually useless. As a stand alone app on the iPad, it's great.",1
"I paid for the premium and I really enjoy the app! Its really nice as you can have notes, tasks, and events all in the same place. It allows you to see either the day, week, or month which is very nice. Im not someone who usually pays for an app as I dont usually continuously use it. But for school and personal life, this really helps me keep track of things! My family and I, we all have very busy scheduals and this allows the whole family to communicate with their plans.",1
"No nonsense Planner PIM software. I like the sync features, ability to lifetime purchase, speed, and the use of the ABC123 Task ordering system. I wish it had a backup database to file function and more sync options, like to a home server. I'm currently using it with a Galaxy Z Fold and it works well. The Widgets look quite good in the OneUI launcher screen.",1
"I started using it two weeks ago and so far it's working great. I needed something integrated that I could just take notes with for the day. *update* beware if you sync across multi devices that when you add an event, make sure you are consistent with the calenders. I have multiple emails and then for some reason, I have 2 ""family"" calendars. If you add an event, make sure you're aware what calendar you are using! I'm still happy but it caused me some issues before I realized what was happening.",1
"I use the free version and it is absolutely amazing. it syncs to my google calendar so I don't have to bother entering events to both apps. I love the notes feature, I use it to plan out my entire schedule for the day, and what I especially love is that I can see my events and my notes in one page. super easy to use and is the perfect visual schedule that I need.",1
"Great app! SUGGESTION: 1. It would be nice if the widgets and the in-ap UI display the time for tasks just the way it does for events. 2. The widget can also make events faded when the time has passed, giving an idea of what's left for the day. Thank you.",1
"This has been my go-to planner for a few years. I use it for everything, and it has never failed me. I love that you can set multiple reminders with notifications or emails at particular timepoints before an event. You can add a location to each event or task, invite people to events, and set priorities for tasks. The app also has a ""notes"" feature...I can't say enough good things about this app. It keeps me put together. Thank you to the developers!!! üíØüíØüíØ",1
"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",1
"only discovered this app a few days ago, but I wish I had found it ages ago! it is exactly what I need to keep myself organized. I have some neurological stuff that makes it easy to forget everything. I love that I can quickly tap on the task widget and get my thoughts down before they disappear. THE WIDGETS ARE AMAZING! I was happy to see that you can purchase this outright and not just the subscription options, which turned me off some similar apps. Ads are well-placed and not distracting.",1
"So far a great app! I love that my google calendar and daily tasks show up on the same daily view! It's so close to being perfect for me... However, I wish they had a web version. You can install it on a PC through Bluestacks but it's not ideal. Also would love a weekly task view and monthly task view. (I know what tasks I want to get done this month, but I don't always know when I'll be able to do it.)",1
"Have had this app for years and it's great. Syncs up easily with my other calendars. I use it daily. I've liked all the enhancements except the recent Notes enhancement. The delete button is on the top right now (used to be on bottom of page), and the save is on the top left. In other apps I use, the save button is always on the top right, so there have been a couple times I've almost deleted my notes accidently. Minor inconvenience. Overall the app is really intuitive and a great planner.",1
"Used to keep a paper planner. Been looking for a digital planner for a long time. Discovered THIS! It has notes, schedule and a to-do list in one app. Integrates with Google. Every thing I need. And does it well. The only thing that would be icing on the cake. Would be the ability to change the colors of various things in the app",1
"I like this planner. It has almost everything that I would like in a planner. I've been trying to get onto a digital planner for a long time and this is the first one that fits the bill. In addition to all the normal planning stuff I can insert pictures, sketches, and take notes and have appts. Entering the pictures and sketches are things that I couldn't enter before and kept me on a paper planner. It works efficiently with the camera and it's easy to add the pictures and stuff as a result.",1
Quite useful. Great for the price.,1
Useful for daily take a note.,1
Love it,1
Great app for beginners at organizing,1
"If you are bipolar and seeking something to help you keep track of events, tasks, projects, even the day... I've been using this thing for years and wouldn't recommend anything more. Take the leap on this one. The ads aren't awful even in unpaid version but the full is only $5 and well worth it. The ability to organize things by priority complete with alarms in unparalleled to everything else I've ever tried. Hope this helps, and thanks Planner Pro team, for creating something so dependable",1
Like this app. Do not like that you have to purchase before you can add repeated tasks.,1
"This is by far the best Day Planner App I have found, and I have tried most of them! Having your Tasks and Calendar all together in the one place really suits the way I like to work. It also means you are less likely to miss something because you didn't check you Task App or Calendar that day. Sure there are a couple if things I'd like to see added, but you can say that about almost any App!",1
"Update: 2 yrs using it, STILL loving this app! ‚ô•Ô∏è Best support team if you have any questions or need any help.",1
"Wonderfully simple yet effective calendar. I swear I've downloaded every calendar in the play store trying to find one I like and this is the only one I could tolerate, now I love it! The free version is great and the paid version is extremely affordable.",1
"I love it. It helps me stay organized with my day. My only wish is that I could use it on my Chromebook. This is a major. Update: This program continues to be my daily organizer. It works well with my Surface Duo. I keep it open on one screen, leaving the other for other apps.",1
"I have been using Planner Pro for several years. I like this organizer much better than others I've tried. I don't like the ones that come with the phones. Planner Pro works better, for me, with my Samsung Notes than with my LG's. The calendar is clean and well organized. I can have several different calendars all working together or separately, ie work, family, personal, groups, and volunteer. I definitely recommend the Planner Pro. Plus it works well with my Gmail calendar.",1
"Love this app. I started with the free app, looked it but went for the pro version. I especially liked that it syncs with Google mail. The classic theme version is colorful and yet business like too. I have very much enjoyed using it over the last couple of years! Well done and thanks ! üëç",1
"Looks good, easy to use, wish there was a way to make the whole calender show up as a widget with the events written out instead of dots. Once you click it it pops up, but would be so convenient to glance and see what I have on the calendar. Still worth the money for a year.",1
"I have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar+planner app. Easy on eyes, strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity (Google and Microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this) and ... just great. When I start earning I'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude :)",1
I like how I can use this across multiple platforms and devices. Runs smoothly. Would be nice to customize the widget a bit more as well as some color schemes in app because I don't care for the main daily colors but other than that it's amazing! The pro vs is worth it üëå,1
Literaly the best planner i have ever used. It is easy to use and have every feature that you need without being overly complicated to a point where it is distracting. I have been doing all my highschool studying plans in this app and will use it in college if it keeps up the good work.,1
"Love it. As a Franklin planner user since '84, this is the closest app that I have found to that format. Only wish I would have is for a windows version that I could use on my office desktop that would sync across to my android phone and tablet.",1
Wonderful application. I love the way it saves my events and tasks to my Google and device calender. I am interested in the application and it assists me in my daily and long term endeavors. The restrictions in the Demo alow alot of flexibility. Thank you to the creator/s.,1
"Franklin Covey planner replacement. I used it for years. It has task priorities. It has a section for your projects. You can backup your data. It has a day, week, and month view, but it's best viewed on landscape mode. It has the capability to access multiple calendars. This app hasn't given any reason to look elsewhere for a new solution. It does what I need it to do. As such, I recommend it.",1
Great app!!! Super simple to use. Straight forward and to the point. Doesn't make you go thru hoops to get something done. You can sync your Google account calender so you don't miss any thing you had down and makes the transition between your old calender to this one super easy I highly recommend this app.,1
"I love it. A calendar, note app, and planner all in one. Other features as well that just make it so much more effectiant. I dont have any problem with adds, and as far as that I really can't say I've experienced anything bad while using the app. It's awesome.",1
"I had this app 3 years ago. I could not sync my tablet and phone. Also, include important appointments and events. I think it was to understand how it worked and I did not use it. This year 2022, I needed a good Planner, all I tried would not fit my needs. I finally took a second try on my old Planner Pro. I am very happy now that after trail and error it is working just right for me.",1
"This is the best planing app I could find on the play store. It syncs with my Google calendar enabling it to be an all inclusive planner, but also has lots of personal orginazational abilities. I am very impressed with this planner and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be very well planned.",1
Love the app 100% We use it to put loads we have to deliver . We add material name number address Everyone in the company can access the info and check it off once it is complete The free version is just as good as the paying one. No need to pay . I didnt notice to much a difference between the two options,1
I am enjoying this app and love many things about it. The only thing I would add is to be able to write in the daily tab without adding a whole event so I can just jot down my timeline of more minuet things.,1
This is he only planner I use. It has improved over time and does an excellent job of keeping me on track.,1
App is really simple to use yet has everything I need in one place. I don't use the notes section but for planning and organizing much of my life this is fantastic,1
Back to being amazing! I'm so glad you provided the flexibility for the week layout to be either vertical or horizontal. Thank you so much!,1
Great feature-filled planner with customizable project and to-do lists. Upgrading to pro was well worth the price.,1
"It has everything I need and since I upgraded, it's even better. I can set reminders, manage my calendar, make projects and I finally have my notes all on one App, which I can have access to from various devices (Phone and Tablet). All in all, a really well done App with all things necessary included and not cluttered with other needless gimmicks.",1
"I love it! I wish there was integration between decvices. I have to use a different app that then ports to both planner pro apps, one for my phone and one for my tablet. It doesn't make me pay twice, I can sign in and reintegreate the calender I import in. That is nice.",1
"I am very new...about a week! I love that i can see AP on all devices (even an OLD ipad!). It is taking me along time to get it set up, to figure out how i want to use it. I am SO greatful for this app!!! i have spent too much money buying other digital planner apps that i was unable to figure out how to use. I am so happy with Artful Agenda Plus! i looks like something accomplished! the Admins are super friendly, the communnity is very friendly and cheerful!!! I am quite happy i bought this",1
"Works great, even on the free version. Love that you can put the task lists as widgets on the home screen. it works great as a grocery list. It's definitely worth the buy of lifetime premium when you can use it across devices, too! Only nitpick when swiping through the app, I'll accidentally delete tasks and other times struggle to delete them cause the swipe option fails to recognize my finger. It's not a huge deal since you can easily undo things.",1
"Thus far, enjoying the app, cross-device use, connectivity, and ease in adding the multiple personal and business accounts I monitor. One product suggestion which was submitted to tech support, have Samsung Galaxy Tab 6Lite and the pen to text does not work. Will this be a future feature.",1
I use this app in place of the calendar. It is fantastic and more user friendly than other similar apps.,1
"flexible, customizable, lightweight, and ad-free. Just overall a solid app. I highly recommend watching/reading the tutorials to use this to its fullest.",1
I have been using tasks for over a year now and having used many other task managers over the years this is without doubt by far the best.,1
"Very easy to use. Organize in multiple categories or titles. I will definitely consider the purchase option. Excellent app, well recommend.",1
Love this app. Super helpful for staying organised and upto date with tasks and goals.,1
Well organized,1
"Simple. Efficient. Free. What more can you ask for? This app completely changed how I approach the things that need doing in life, and it has been integral to my professional development. I ended up buying Premium and I'm never looking back! Onto the next task. :)",1
Thank you üòá,1
I am getting used to it but so far so good!,1
Helps keep me on task,1
"Easy to use, and it works. üòä",1
This app is great! It's choc full of options even with the basic version. The pro version is great but some options I don't really need. I'm happier with this task app than with any others I have tried. Good job!,1
"Excellent, well designed and easy to use app. Customer service is top notch. Had an issue with the widget not refreshing, and got a response from Steve in under an hour with a suggestion that fixed the problem. Couldn't expect more.",1
So easy to use and customise with bright colours,1
I love this app for remembering what to pack for trips! 10/10,1
Best has everything,1
Such a handy and easy to use app. Brilliant!,1
"I was looking for a to do list app where I can insert a task in a task in a task. With this app I can create subtasks, tasks, categories, lists which is perfect for me.",1
"I love it because of the widgets and the colors, it's very useful",1
"Great app to organize things, keep my tasks on track and get notified when it is due.",1
Good so far,1
I love the quick add features because I am so ADHD sometimes I'll have a task in my head for only 20 sec. This aids me in getting everything done.,1
Awesome üëå,1
"I use this app several times a day. I'm retired, but I still have lots of different responsibilities. I have a grocery list, and as I buy each item, I hide the item. Then when I'm ready to go shopping again, I can bring the item up to the list again. And I'm constantly changing my priorities with ease. I Make use of the background colors for each chore. Morning shores is the lightest orange. Outdoor chores are green. Driving to errands are purple. That way, it's easy to regroup them.",1
Brilliant app!!,1
So helpful as a widget on my homescreen! Super easy to use. Works perfectly for my ADD brain üòÖ I love the priority options.,1
"very useful, just what I need. You can add sublists to a list, good for organizing any project and keep track of a project",1
"This app is really useful for planning all sorts of stuff. With the premium option I update my task list from my phone, tablet and PC. I have sent in a few suggestions, that have all been implemented. A very well written product.",1
It's easy and simple and help me stay on the top of my game,1
Works great,1
Nice,1
Very useful and straightforward,1
I like the ability to create multiple lists and easily move tasks between lists. The option for subtasks can help make tasks more manageable.,1
Very easy to use and quite useful!,1
It's really helps,1
"Only just started using, really liking it so far. Sub lists are excellent for keeping my adhd in line as I can just add something to the random things sub list and then go back to things without the worry that I'll forget about it",1
"I really like the ""cancel event"" and ""hide cancelled event"" functions since I subscribe to three different school calendars for my kids, and not everything applies to my family. However, the events keep reappearing, which is a little frustrating. I also like how easy the attachment function is; I can just snap a picture and add it to the event.",1
"Excellent app, with many different options. I bought it for the Agenda widget, and have customized it extensively (because I could). However, Android 9-12 versions have very clean designs, and different is not always better. Some of the apps screens (such as defining a new calendar entry) are much too cluttered for my liking, as well as missing some native features like resolving the location using the built-in Google Maps search.",1
"I've been using the pro version for four years and loved it until recent year-end. During the holidays, daytime sync with Google Tasks stopped. When I wake each morning, I find that many or even most tasks have synced, but can't force any more syncs for the rest of day. I've reset and reinstalled the app without success. With the holidays over, I need to resolve this and get back to work, and find that I can download other competing apps that work great. Please fix.",1
"I previously gave this app 5 stars based on several years use. But when I accessed it today all my data was missing, including many appointments & events extending out to August 2023! The last time I used it was to add an appointment and I definitely haven't messed with settings, or deleted any data. It seems the recent app update may have failed...(?) üò¨ UPDATE: I started to rebuild my known Calendar entries. As soon as I saved the 1st one, all my info for the year reappeared!! Spooky. üëÄ",1
"Having problems. The app is not syncing anymore with my Google calendar. I double-checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync, still no good. It is set to auto sync every 3 hours. Edit: changed from 3 to 4 stars. I appreciate the suggestion to try and help. It didn't fix the issue. However with my new phone the app is working seamlessly. Very easy to use, lots of customization, visually easy to read. Thanks.",1
"Love the program and it's definitely an improvement over Google Calendar. Just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book. It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a",1
"Very nice calendar app, unfortunately seems dependent on Google. I don't use goolag's calendar, but had to link a dummy G account. Can't find a way to unlink the dummy account and don't want it to sync. If their is a way to eliminate Google from the equation, it'll be a keeper, else I'll eat whatever I paid and go back to simple calendar. I've only experienced issues with widget disappearing or widget calendar appearing blank. If I open the app, it seems to right itself.",1
"What happened to the setting for choosing how far in the future to sync calendars? The app on my phone is only showing events for 1 month in the future, and then the calendar is blank. There are many events much further out than this, that I can no longer see on the app. I've been through the entire menu tree and no longer see the setting for length of time to sync.",1
"I've been using BC for several years now and I really enjoy how powerful it is, though it can be cumbersome to use until you take the time to learn how to use it. I used to only use the basic functionality and was actually quite frustrated with some stuff until I sat down and played with it. There are some things I would improve like tasks, but for the most part it's great. I usually only use the free version of apps, but this is one I paid for. My biggest complaint was one that I have read from other users about the default notification for all day events going off 30 mins or an hour before (11pm or 11:30 pm) while you're sleeping. I was about ready to uninstall this app because of this, but I couldn't find another app that addressed this problem (I tried a few). I did some research and found there is a setting in your Google Calendar you can change to fix this problem. First, go to the settings for each calendar you want to modify. Under settings you should find a section for 'Event notifications' and 'All-day event notifications'. I removed the values that were present in both sections. I do have a calendar that I share with my family that everyone can add events to. Sometimes I need notifications for items on this calendar and sometimes I don't. What I did was setup an email notification that whenever anyone adds an event to this calendar, I get an email notification of the new event. This setting is found under the 'Other notifications' setting. The benefit here is it's another method to alert me to new events and then when I see the email, I can decide if I need an alert or not. If no alert is needed, I move on. If an alert is needed, I can open the item on my calendar and add the appropriate reminders through BC2. I am no longer woken up in the middle of the night by all day events that my wife added to our calendar and I didn't remove the default notification for. This solved my biggest gripe which ended up not being a problem with BC2 at all. I'm still not thrilled with the task settings as I believe there's room for improvement here. I would really like to be able to remove my other reminder app, but there's some things it can do that BC cannot. For example, I can setup my other app to play an insistent sound (repeat) until I acknowledge it. I've also found it a little difficult to schedule reminders to call people in BC2. I can link contacts fairly easily, but not individual numbers that are not in my contacts. Also, sorting tasks based on priority (yes, that's what the 5 little boxes at the bottom of a task are for) would make it even better. Making these changes would make BC2 amazing!",1
I happily pay for this app. It does the normal notifications which most calendars do. But I really like the icons that I can add (and the different colors) so that I can see at a glance what type of appointment I am adding. I also like the ease with which I can copy or change recurring appointments. It's also very reliable -- another must for calendar apps.,1
"I've used this for a long time. Great calendar app. Also, the widget is super handy. Always on my home screen. I've set it up this same way for four different phones. Edit 4/23/2022 Still going strong. Clean monthly interface. I honestly don't know what I would do without a calendar on my phone. This one is leaps and bounds better than the android default. Edit 1/8/2023 It would be nice if they had a way to fix duplicates. Happens all the time with Holidays. My only complaint.",1
I've been using this app for 5+ years. Just absolutely amazing and very customizable! One feature I've waiting for is the ability to reorganize the bookmarks at the bottom of the calendar. It is extremely annoying having to remove all from favorites and re-add them one by one. Some kind of setting to move them would be appreciated!!,1
"I love the app! It has great options. The task list is amazing and has a great selection of things you can choose to do and tasks to preform that make your calender very detailed. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would like to see more tasks, and personalization options for those on a very tight budget such as myself who cannot afford at this point in to purchase the pro version. Other than that it is an amazing and awesome app and I will continue to use ur ob a daikt basis.",1
"This is my preferred calendar over the stock calendar. If it didn't randomly put in a 1130p reminder notification on its own on ""all day"" events, I'd give it 5 stars. It puts it in after it's saved and you don't know it until it's buzzing at 1130p! Annoying, since I have to have calendar events override DND. It automatically puts a 30m reminder in sometime after you save it. I only want reminders if I put them in.",1
"I really, really love this app when it works and syncs. The problem is, I have 6 accounts with Google... and every now and then it would stop syncing or disappears my recurring appts on one of the calendar. All I can do is add a new recurring one. Problem is, if I go onto my web browser or anywhere else, it'll show 2 entries!! If I delete them, they'll be removed from this app. It gets super annoying when one is fixed, and then the other disappears. I've had this issue on my prior phone to now.",1
"I have only used this app a couple of weeks and it has helped tremendously. it has more versatility/flexibility than the many other apps I've tried, which is what makes it work so well.",1
"The app has a lot of features that I like and use in a calendar, e.g., search, go to, repeating appointments, and the list goes on. I knocked off a star because I would really like to zoom in on the calendar. Otherwise, it works for me. I purchased the ad free option. 9/4/2023 UPDATE - After using the app for 2 years, my review remains unchanged. I would still like to be able to zoom in on the calendar instead of the small window that opens to see the events of the day.",1
"Been using for 3 years, first with Android 6.0, now with 8.1.  For the last few months it stopped syncing regularly to my Google calendar. As of last week, it won't sync at all.  If these issues were addressed, 5/5 for customization, widgets, and value.  Edit: 4/5 for customization, widgets, value, and prompt developer response and assistance. Minus 1 star because I'm still unable to sync it between calendars automatically.",1
"Amazing app. I've been looking for such an app for quite some time. The only thing I miss is a way to set ""all day"" as a default.",1
Very useful and keeps me moving forward,1
One of the best time management app I have used till now. Amazing interface and the powerful editing environment make this product a unique and personalised experience. I hope in future updates we'll be seeing a more accessible interface. Nonetheless the pro version deserves the price and feels absolutely stunning. Nice work guys! Keep it up.,1
"I keep all my appointments on this app. I use multiple calendars & colors or emoji to highlight events. I like the itemized description function. I use the recurring events & tasks. My only negative is that I wish there could be a dependency on tasks function, where a task start could move depending on an uncompleted dependent task. I sync this calendar with family members so that we can all keep up with each other.",1
"Generally, the best calendar app in the playstore, no doubt... BUT, there has always been this one bug that drives me insane, which prompted me to buy a different calendar app. The bug: Some calendar items do not sync or disappear should you make any changes to it. I'll have to resync, setting to private then public, or worst case, create a duplicate on google cal and delete the old one. The event shows up fine on all other calendar apps, just not this one even after trying to ""fix"" it.",1
"Best calendar app out, liked it so much I paid for the upgrade which I normally will not do on any app(s). I have already rated your app!!! Please stop the pop-ups to rate your app. Acting quirky with Android 13. Can't get my highlighted colors to show up and what I had colored no longer works. Not sure what to do anymore, seems I've tried everything.",1
"Was my goto calendar for years. Easy, intuitive, configurable. It's issue for me is using the Android calendar sync vice directly syncing with Google. I need to have access to historical and distant future events. If the developers can change the sync option, I'd come back in a heartbeat and rate it a 5! **Just noticed reply ... Yes I did try this work around and others from my research. Did not work unfortunately. Still unusable for me. Sorry.",1
"After the last update I had to clear the cache & data, clear the cache partition, then lose all my events to stop the double notifications/reminders. This has been a great app for many years and this is the first time I've had trouble with it. It was a pain to go through all that to fix it but that's how much I like this app. I have a Galaxy S9+ with latest IO update. UPDATE: No matter how I set my reminders, the maximum # I could get it to alert was two. I gave up & went back to BC Pro. Ugh!",1
"Love the app and use it as my main calendar and to-do list. However, it would be nice to be able to view the tasks sidebar while on week view, particularly on wider displays such as tablets or laptops. Also, the Windows interface is poor (relies on Windows Subsystem for Android). Another minor suggestion: allow custom week numbers. Useful for students who operate on an academic calendar, with week 1 usually being somewhere in September.",1
"I love the app. Will give 5 stars if it can sync automatically directly with office 365. Right now, my company is so secure with so many securities, Microsoft exchange is not syncing automatically. I need to select the sync button. I think if it gave me the option to sync with Microsoft 365 instead of exchange, it would work.",1
"great app! love how easy it is to move an appointment if it gets rescheduled. one thing I would love or perhaps I just don't know how to work it, but tasks that I forget to do, I wish would remind me that I still need to do it. I have a recurring task to replace a filter but I forgot one month and it was never completed so the next three months I never did it because the task wasn't there!",1
"Very pleased with the app overall. However we are experiencing syncing issues from unit to unit where there is a huge delay, if it syncs at all. And if the other units receive the appointment, it is altered, and comes through as an ""all day"" appointment when it was entered with specific times for notifications and meeting times.",1
"I really like how tasks are handled. You can be very descriptive, see them all in one view, and move them to the next day easily. Though l, I did pay the pro price to get recurring tasks. The day view is good too. It's like an agenda, but without the details, it gives a good view of the time you'll be using. The pop-up on the monthly view to see the day and add to it is also convenient. If you sync it to Google Cal, it is a full sync. What you do on one shows on the other.",1
"I like that it will let me switch my calendar of origin, and the pro homescreen widget looks like a planner page! A couple things aren't intuituve for me, like having to remember to tap üìù before I edit an event or task and remember to save before I back out or my changes will be lost. That's the #1 reason this is only a secondary calendar app. And I need to scroll (not swipe) for next month. If I swipe it gives me that number of days on my view. That's a cool feature, just not used to it! üò£",1
"Seems like a stellar calendar app, but the entire reason I downloaded it was that I was hoping to have something fully disconnected from Google Calendar so I could have a clean separate app for work. Instead it forced me to link them and automatically imported all the personal events that I don't want to deal with in this one. This is fine for people looking to switch, but I really wish there was an option not to sync them.",1
"I have used this app for years and love it! Giving it 4 stars though because my widgets don't work anymore after the last update. Every time I restart my phone, the widget stays in ""loading"" mode and I have to remove and re-do it to see my calendar. I'm also having issues linking Exchange accounts even though the accounts are synced with my phone. The pros: easy to use, a million ways to personalize and the ability to use separate widgets for individual calendars is incredibly useful to me.",1
Simple and easy app to use. Already installed in a couple of devices.,1
Does everything I need for this application,1
Using it for a week now so far so good still learning all it has to offer.,1
It's nice that I can write long tasks. Notepad doesn't show long entries.,1
"Excellent overall. I wish tasks could have subbtasks recursively. One iteration subtasks are useful, though.",1
Easy and effective!!,1
Straightforward and easy to use,1
A+,1
Auxiliary Memory Enjoy using this app daily to make sure everything on my todo list is done. I also installed it on my husband's phone for the same purpose. Thank you for this app. It is making us more productive. I have one suggestion. The reminders should be listed in priority order. God Bless. Heather,1
Best,1
"Easy to use and edit, love all the colors to make it fun. Super simple.",1
Does everything and more .lots of shortcuts,1
"This app is fantastic. The list features are awesome. You can add list items to your calendar, share your lists, and there are many great feature for each item on the list. You can also add the list as a worker on your home page. I have several lists as widgets. This is by far the best list app I've ever used.",1
"It would be better if it was free, but for everything you can do without paying, it helps me out wonders!",1
Super,1
I use it to organize my days and its very user friendly,1
Just wonderful!!,1
"As a retired IT Consulting Infrastructure Engineer Project Manager I found To Do List Tasks: Tasks by Pocket Brilliance impressively intuitive. Adaptable to major projects or simple task lists. Easy learning curve like paper & pencil. Add subtasks, notes. Drag & drop reorder to prioritize. Set due dates, reminders. Share Tasks with Premium upgrade. Try Free. Premium gives PC and web features, task. Exemplary support. Monthly Premium or save with Lifetime. Highly recommended!",1
"10/10 I can make lists, and lists in those lists, and then lists in the lists for my lists!!! ADHD managed!! üòä",1
"I use it daily, I love this app - thank you!",1
"I discovered the Tasks app by Pocket Brilliance on Christmas Eve and was completely amazed with its functionality, features, and design. After only a day of playing around with the free version, I knew that this was the app for me, so I purchased a subscription as a Christmas gift to myself. It's the first app that, in my opinion, really ""gets it"" in blending power, simplicity, speed, and the Getting Things Done (GTD) concepts of David Allen. The filtered lists and tags are great!",1
"I've been downloading various to do list apps all day long and testing them out, and this is the best one I've tried so far. Very clean and easy to use. a very well made app. i technically have this 5 stars, but it's probably a 4.75 for me (fwiw). One thing: I wish there was a way to duplicate lists. I can duplicate sublists within a list, which is close, but I would love to be able to duplicate a list entirely so that it shows in the left hand menu and not as a tab within a list.",1
Works well. No problems so far. I'm well pleased. It started giving me a reminder that I could not stop. On Saturday morning I had a reminder set and when it went off I marked it done and the alarm continued. I even went through all settings and could not make it stop. It continued for at least 5 minutes. The next week same thing. I had to go through and delete all reminders to make it stop. Thank you for your response. I deleted and reinstalled. Is working perfectly now. Thanks!,1
"I absolutely love this app! I'm picky when it comes to tasks app, because most free versions are chaulk full of annoying ads. However, this Task app has exceeded my expectations! There's no annoying ads. It doesn't glitch. And it's very user-friendly. There are so many ""Pros"" to this app that I can't list them all. Here are my top ""Pros"": - Create separate lists (work, home) - Customize colors for each list - Unlimited subcategories for tasks - May attach pics to tasks - Add reminders to task",1
"I love this app so much. I've tried them all and Tasks is like my second brain. It's beautiful to me that the developer offers it for free with no ads because after so many failed task apps, it really lessened the barrier to trying yet another new one. Take some time to adjust the settings and find your groove with nesting and organizing tasks and you will never need another task app. Seriously, I love Tasks so much. Thank you for finally creating something I can stick with to organize my life.",1
"Great app. Easy to use and customize as much or as little as you want. Lots of flexibility; sub-lists, sub-tasks, color coding, reminders, sorting, and more. The ability to create a list that is a combination of other lists (filtered list) is fantastic. One wish list item: I listen to music on my phone and when an alarm goes off, it stops my music so and i have to turn it back on. It would be great if the alarm just paused other sounds (like other apps i use) rather than stop them.",1
Very useful and easy to use,1
"Moved my personal to-do list to Tasks recently from another app that wanted a sub before certain basic features were unlocked, and have been pleased with the decision. Better widget implementation, sublist possibilities, and possibly my favorite feature, filtered lists -- I use tags and due dates with filtered lists to bring the most immediate tasks to the top of the pile. The repeating feature is a little non intuitive to set up, by the dev offers a great video to walk you thru if needed.",1
"This app really is amazing - I'd have lost my head without it. No ads, easy to use, and the reminders - so much stuff wouldn't get done without the reminders. Such a life saver, and by life I mean grades. Only real thing I wish that I could have with it was tye ability to attach something to a task. That, and I never remember how to delete a category, but that's more on me.",1
"I absolutely love and depend on this app daily. I tried a few different ones and didn't like the functionality until I discovered this one. My favorite feature is being able to have multiple lists, and sub lists within those. This allows me to organize my related tasks together instead of a single massive list. I also love the reminders, since I have a hard time remembering to do things when I intend to. Definitely the best Task app.",1
"great app , thanks so much",1
Best to do list app I've found.,1
Love the simplicity of the app. Easy checklists with custom colors. It's so satisfying to cross things off.,1
"Having used numerous task/reminder apps, this is the best I have come across. The developer also replies incredibly quickly. Think I have finally found the one for all my needs.",1
"I've tried many many notification apps (even paid for them and deleted them.) This app is very people friendly, multiple options to set a reminder, the alarms are visually appealing (not obnoxious). Only issue is the soonest repeat notification option is daily, not (min, hrly). So a new separate notification has be set. But seriously how lazy does a person have to be if they can't take 2 mins to add another ?!? So 5 stars all the way. KUDOS to a awesome app!!!",1
Very helpful for organizing and jotting.,1
"Easy to use, well laid out",1
Great app.... Really useful,1
I absolutely love this app im so glad I decided to try it,1
"This is a really excellent Task/To Do app. The feature I particularly liked is the Calendar view so that you view the day's tasks without the clutter of yesterday, tomorrow etc. Developer response is fast and very helpful. The premium version has a web mirror so you can you use the app on your laptop or tablet or both.",1
Have used for years and is excellent.,1
Very nice,1
"Early days yet but so far I really like this app. Especially the simplicity and flexibility. It can be used for just about ANY To-Do List. I really appreciate the bright, colourful design and additional features that can make important items 'Pop' like free tailorable tabs and highlights. Also impressed with the rapid feedback and help from the designer.",1
great app,1
"This app is still quite new to me, but so far it is the easiest to use and the most customizable, all for free!!!",1
"I enjoy being able to quickly add tasks, schedule them, etc. (a lot to play with, if you want). Love the opportunity of color coding.",1
"Best list app out there. Love how easy it is to use, quickly add tasks and subtasks, can add lots of details and reminders, looks great. Seriously the best balance of simple and complex. Love love love it",1
Very helpful in scheduling bill payments.,1
This App is absolutely awesome! And the support is even better. Thanks for a app that is a really useful tool.,1
‚ô•Ô∏è,1
The app is really helpful in creating quick reminders.,1
Very helpful for us disorganized but driven people!,1
very easy to operate,1
"Great so far, easy to use.",1
No issues or bugs,1
"Easily accessible, all tools and settings are intuitive. Makes my life easier through organization.",1
Does the job,1
Loveee! Exactly what I want!,1
Love this. I keep a running list of work items and check them off when completed.,1
"After trying enormous amount of different apps this one is the BEST, user friendly everything can be easily organized, really good job done here. Highly recommend. I'd like to ask if it's possible to add more then one attachment, and also a share button as well. Thank you",1
Very good app. A lot of flexibility.,1
Easy to use and so helpful,1
Good stuff,1
Very helpful,1
Highly responsive developer. Google disabled persistent notifications unfortunately.,1
Best app for managing Tasks,1
I have used this app for a few years and I absolutely love it.,1
"Really like the widget for keeping track j of my day. I like being able to add bigger project and then have sublists. Would like to have repeat option for daily tasks. Very helpful for ADHD. I now understand. Use the help videos, their is a lot of capabilties. Great customer support also.",1
"I've just started using this app. So far, I really like it. I originally gave this app four stars but changed it to five after using it multiple times yesterday.",1
"Made My life very easy. What a app this is. Works perfectly, very easy to use and systematic, Thank you to app developer",1
The best task organizer!! Very easy to use.,1
"HIGHLY recommended this app, especially for neurodivergent people who are easily overstimulated by the other task apps. this app has no distracting ads, is very intuitive to navigate, and easy to customize for your individual sensory needs. it has everything i need in a task list app, no more and no less. @ the developers: thank you for making a task app that actively makes my life feel less overwhelming.",1
"I use the free version and find it very user friendly with just a short learning curve. I'm very happy with the app. I used to use Google calendar and was very frustrated with it's inability to be able to change days of previous month and next month colors. My Wife and I sync our mobile calendars so we don't double schedule. Business Calendar does everything we want it to do, I won't go back to Google calendar.",1
"Works well a vast majority of the time but have had two instances of it not saving a created appointment. I use the widget in my home screen to enter appointments and have missed an appointment that I entered. When checked, it wasn't to be found. Another instance I checked 5 minutes later and my appointment was missing. Overall great, easy to make entries, and many color options.",1
"Love the app, but I am unable to search for a location. I have to have the address when creating an event",1
"Great app - with plenty of features and customisation. Just one question: in the description, it says ""includes watch app, tiles and complications for your watch face"". I have installed the app on my watch (Galaxy Watch 6) and have found the tiles, but why don't I see any specific complications for the watch face?",1
"Love the calendar app on my android, has it for years now, but I have no idea why I can't sync it with Google anymore. And yes, its enabled on my phone, as far as i know",1
"Generally, the best calendar app in the playstore, no doubt... BUT, there has always been this one bug that drives me insane, which prompted me to buy a different calendar app. The bug: Some calendar items do not sync or disappear should you make any changes to it.

Super,1
It's nice and simple to use,1
"Been using this as my default calendar for years. Best layout, in my opinion. Still four stars because they don't cache changes made when offline. This has resulted in a number of lost notes when hiking - the best time to freethink. I have to notice if I'm online and use Google calendar when disconnected.",1
Good and beautiful but the widgets are sometimes not refreshing automatically.,1
Decent for what I need it to do.,1
"Have experience a seemingly technical inability to change colors for my event themes. Also, experiencing duplications when I edit repeat events. I haven't found a solution to either glitch.",1
Good calendar for setting appointments.,1
"Best calendar app out, liked it so much I paid for the upgrade which I normally will not do on any app(s). I have already rated your app!!! Please stop the pop-ups to rate your app. Acting quirky with Android 13. Can't get my highlighted colors to show up and what I had colored no longer works. Not sure what to do anymore, seems I've tried everything.",1
Looks nice. Easy to use.,1
A very useful app,1
Seems good. Tablet version on chromebook is hard to make a new appointment.,1
"The app is great. I'm currently using it as a driving instructor to keep a private diary of when I'm taking learners on lessons. The only thing I'd love to see is the ability to automate an SMS template like: ""Hey [Name], just a reminder that your lesson is at [date/time]."" and have that send automatically a few hours before the start time would be phenomenal ‚ò∫Ô∏è I used to use Goldie for that, but they want ¬£30 per month which is extortionate!",1
great app needs weather needs saving,1
"Love it - wanted an app to combine Apts & Tasks from Google, with good widgets - does that & more üòÅ",1
"I keep all my appointments on this app. I use multiple calendars & colors or emoji to highlight events. I like the itemized description function. I use the recurring events & tasks. My only negative is that I wish there could be a dependency on tasks function, where a task start could move depending on an uncompleted dependent task. I sync this calendar with family members so that we can all keep up with each other.",1
"Good clean intuitive interface, unfortunately like most calendar apps, the widget doesn't always update automatically.",1
Sufficient for my needs. Rare ads are at an acceptable level for a free app.,1
Easy to use... + good 'widget'...,1
"Now with outlook support, the best organizer ever! I just wish we could set shorter sync periods. Now the shortest in the settings is one hour. Tasks have a long delay to be shown (sometimes until I sync manually)",1
Good app,1
"Great calendar with vertical scroll. However, it is annoying when an app changes it's icon.",1
"Good app, would be great to have the ability to display a few lines of event description in the agenda widget.",1
"Excellent app. Never an issue until today, while at my medical appointment, I was making the next appointment for the first week of July. Inexplicably, my monthly widget showed July 4th as being on a Tuesday, the girl making the appointment for me said no, it's on a Thursday. I verified it said July 2024, showed it to her, she said yea, it's wrong. Opened app, month view was correct. How can this happen? The widget was showing the 2023 day/date info? I wish I grabbed a screenshot.",1
"Other than the ads, I'm happy with this app. Keeps me organized!!",1
No issues easy to use,1
"It's a great app but, when adding a new event from the wigit, it often saves it as occurring a day earlier than intended. As long as you're aware of this and double-check every time you add an event it's fine, but it would be even better if this issue could be addressed by the developer.",1
"I love this app! However, holidays are tripled for some reason and I don't know how to fix it other than nothing holidays",1
"Could you please create a watch face (watch face is NOT a watch app) with events and tasks? Reference: outlook, sectograph.",1
Need help. App keeps saying Dropbox not configured right when I try to attach a Ln item to an event. I tried unadding and reading Dropbox.,1
Wonderfull tools to put together all your needed information in one board..!,1
Very good App. I especially appreciate the App and Widgets. An issue for me is the event colors are not synchronized with the Google web calendar.,1
"I love the app. Will give 5 stars if it can sync automatically directly with office 365. Right now, my company is so secure with so many securities, Microsoft exchange is not syncing automatically. I need to select the sync button. I think if it gave me the option to sync with Microsoft 365 instead of exchange, it would work.",1
"When I reset my phone and synced my tasks from Google, it loses all the dates and recurrences. All the tasks default to the same date and if I want them changed, I have to do it manually. Can this be fixed? I have to use local tasks as a workaround and then I have to back them up often or risk losing them. The app has a lot of great features. It has several widgets. You can change colors of each day. It is good other than Gtask integration.",1
Please implement material you theme-ing,1
Its OK.,1
"Despite the flaky looking icon, this is the best calendar app for power users. Lots of configurability means you customize it exactly to your liking. I wish it were available on desktop/laptop computers. (-1 star for the flaky icon.)",1
5 star because it does what is says and is a really good calendar. I purchased it but no longer need it because I already have the Samsung calendar already installed. I thought it'll be better but I think I'm just used to the samsung app that I default to it. It's a great app and very good at organizing. I recommend even though I don't need it. I do not regret purchasing it in the first place.,1
Clear easy to follow and apply your request and dates.,1
"After the last update I had to clear the cache & data, clear the cache partition, then lose all my events to stop the double notifications/reminders. This has been a great app for many years and this is the first time I've had trouble with it. It was a pain to go through all that to fix it but that's how much I like this app. I have a Galaxy S9+ with latest IO update. UPDATE: No matter how I set my reminders, the maximum # I could get it to alert was two. I gave up & went back to BC Pro. Ugh!",1
"This app is great! Please allow voice recognition for other languages when adding tasks, events, such as Brazilian Portuguese",1
Don't like new Icon,1
Ver helpfull,1
"I've just installed this otherwise great app to my phone after factory reset, it connected to my calendar with no problems, but for whatever reason it says in tasks ""You don't have any tasks. Good for you..."" But a quick glimpse to tasks in my Google Calendar on PC reveals I have two overdue tasks. So there is a glitch with tasks apparently. EDIT: I had to explicitly connect to my Google tasks, now they show up. But that is a glitch anyway, that should be default.",1
"I've been using this app (and its predecessor) for years. Tried the others - none of them compare. This is full-featured software. Still the best. 2020 UPDATE: Can it be updated to synchronize easily with calendars beyond Google Calendar, without cumbersome multiple-step CalDAV tinkering?",1
"Would like to see more attention being given to separating ""birthdays into more realistic categories",1
"Generally a very nice app. However, I am disappointed that the""filter duplicate events"" feature is no longer working for me, and it was that feature that I got it for in the first place.",1
It keeps my life on track. I would be lost without it. I don't understand why more people don't utilize the calendar.,1
"Tasks time doesnt work correctly. Tasks created in Google Calendar/Tasks show as all day in BC2. And tasks created in BC2 do not have set time in Google Calendar. Otherwise the application is OK, i like widget where you can choose which calendards are shown",1
I quite like this calendar Still figuring out all the quirks,1
"Seems like a stellar calendar app, but the entire reason I downloaded it was that I was hoping to have something fully disconnected from Google Calendar so I could have a clean separate app for work. Instead it forced me to link them and automatically imported all the personal events that I don't want to deal with in this one. This is fine for people looking to switch, but I really wish there was an option not to sync them.",1
"it's a pretty good app it should be easier to find templates though, for editing/deleting them",1
"Very pleased with the app overall. However we are experiencing syncing issues from unit to unit where there is a huge delay, if it syncs at all. And if the other units receive the appointment, it is altered, and comes through as an ""all day"" appointment when it was entered with specific times for notifications and meeting times.",1
"Wish BC2 can show Samsung tasks and Ms ToDo, and add Ms Outlook account... Thanks!",1
I like it,1
Nice and great app,1
How do I add subtasks? I have the paid version.,1
Great!,1
"Tasks auto-sync is mostly problematic, even tapping sync button in widget does not solve it. Tasks sync works only if I manually open the calendar, go to sync menu, and tap the sync menu (with minimum 3 tappings in total). Features other than tasks sync work very well.",1
Really nice,1
"This app is more customizable than anything else I've found, which means I can make it actually work for my weird brain. There are some parts that are not intuitive, but once I figured out workarounds, it's totally worth it for me.",1
Excellent,1
"Good, but I don't like the pub",1
"Very nice addition to have this on the watch as well. One more feature would give it a 5 star, and that is seperate selection of calendars to show on the phone and watch.",1
"Best app calender ever installed, and I directly buy it... But I found one problem. This app can't drag a event which include different days... For example, make task ""sleep"" between 23:00 - 07:00. If I want to drag (change) this 8 hour sleep become 22:30 - 06:30, it's cannot.... Hope you could fix that, please...",1
"this app had been good to me for years, but this latest update messed up all of my appointments. the view is botched - making it difficult to see what's actually on there. once this weird view glitch is fixed, it's back to 5 stars for this app.",1
"I love the color bars for events. My only complaint is at the last update they took away the option to edit one day at a time. If I want to enter a change to one day one an event that is weekly, it changes every week. Then I have to go back and reverse all the other ones thereafter. It used to have the option to change just one day in a chain of weeklies. Please put that option back and the app will be perfect!",1
Decent free calendar app.,1
Good app but widget is working,1
"It just works like I expect it to. Look it's just a calendar app, but I love the interface and how it keeps my work and private calendars displayed. Support is really quick to respond as I had a question about calendar spam (not an app specific issue). I have had this app for years and upgraded to pro. My daughter switched to an iPhone and she said it's the one app she misses the most. Come on guys make an ios version! That's why I only gave it 4 stars... It really deserves 5..",1
"Generally a good application. However we were dropping certain entrys for unknown reasons for several weeks. I don't know if it was caused by my phone, the computer I synchronize with or the application itself or its sister computer program on my desktop computer. It did stop after an update and has not happened for several months",1
"Planners are the tools for success, wouldn't use anything else. I have found this app the best for my needs. Couple issues would make it better ( hence the 4 stars now) With the task side bar up in day view, it would be nice in my personal day planning if I could just 'drag and drop' the task into the day schedule calendar. Other issue: I can't get my Google account tasks to go into the day side window. ( They only show up on the full task tab) Anyways all the versitility is what's great!",1
I like how it works. Though one massive thing I can't either figure out how to do (which is more likely the case). Or you just don't have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day. Like eat 6 times a day. Supplements 8 times. I think you get it. Other then that it's perfect for work. Quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time.,1
Update: I had uninstalled google calendar (since I had BC2 & to free up space). Learned that this may affect sync. Reinstalled google calendar & it's now syncing just fine. Realize BC2 has little control over this but troubleshooting tips would help // I paid for this app and liked it a lot ... had no issues until the past year when it is not syncing properly with my Google calendar. I thought I had fixed it awhile ago with some settings adjustment but I am back to having syncing problems again.,1
"Follow up. What happened to the colors? Part of it, is your program does do some degree of muting colors. I disabled Material You, I have better things to do, than worry if my icon matches my theme. The display settings were in natural. Vivid is a bit intense for my likes, but colors come in much closer on vivid. Improved color match now, only part is the program.",1
"While not easily accessible to a rank beginner, the app seems semi-intuitive & could be very useful for someone (like myself) with experience of digital task-lists, computer calendars, or maybe anyone who's used a few Google productivity apps... I just wish it included clock-style alarms, altho for all I know, it might be linkable...",1
"Great app, the best time setting interface of anything. Only feature I don't like is if you change the start time of an event it proportionally changes the end time so you have to change the end back to where it was and if you change it enough to span the midnight hour now you have to change the days too.",1
"calendar works good. I have a lot of stuff in there that keeps me on track and there is some overlap- I can't open an event below another. I tried to click on where there is no overlap, and sometimes I zoom in, but at times I am forced to delete the event on top to get to the lower one.",1
"Fantastic calendar app. Lots of of customization options. Recommended. Unfortunately, the widget I set is not holding when in ""pop-up widget"" mode on some Android devices. I have to keep selecting the specific widget I want again and again. Has been this way for the last few updates. Please fix.",1
"Almost perfect. I wish that it had an alarm reminder instead of notifications. I don't like to set individual alarm clocks constantly. Please let me know if you guys decide to put an alarm on the app. I try not to look at my phone often, I wouldn't want to miss a reminder. I will purchase instantly then",1
I love the option of color coding events. Sharing calender is HARD. Doesn't always sync like it's supposed to. I really love this calendar but due to not being able to share and keep apts up to date I'm on the hunt again for a new calendar. If it was just for my use this would be perfect.,1
"I like the App. Wish there was a way (if I'm missing something, help) to lock settings once you customize them. Possibly hold 3 styles to reload once you set all the colors, calendars, fonts, designs, etc. I wonder if something like this would be possible for those of us who have paid for the App?",1
"Great app for keeping track of several different calendars/schedules. However, They started putting unskipable ads in while working on it so had to upgrade to the pro. Only took off one star for that because at least it's just a one time charge not subscription.",1
"Just paid for this app. Latest update, I've lost some events in 1 of the 4 Google calendars I view. Those events show up just fine in the Google Calendar, and used to show up o.k. My free Business Calendar. I see you did an update July 20. Maybe there is a bug in that version. I tried stopping the app, cleared cache, cleared all data, started over. Still missing some events in one calendar. Refresh/resync doesn't help. All events showing in Google Calendar. Shut down, restarted phone, not fixed.",1
"I'm not sure, but I keep getting these little hidden files in download folder but I believe they're from the calendar. I haven't checked since the update. But I do use this app every day especially for the widgets and the customization. You can get lost in it, but I'd rather have the option than not.",1
"Now it's reminding me however sometimes twice for same event. Not like before update. Used it for years always was dependable now sometimes I get reminder and sometimes not! Old reminders screen was on whole screen and would turn screen on when reminder was set off. Also when you selected calendar on notification screen it took you to reminder screen, now takes you to event and reminder screen disappears. So disappointed with update. Looking for new app. I also paid for this. :(",1
"Excellent task/calendar app but should work on IOS and windows 10 computers. Then it would be 5 *. Updated 9/2/2021: Really the best Calendar/task master I have ever used. Does everything one could want in a calendar and task manager with clean interface and uncomplicated actions. Linking contacts to tasks and calendar items is a real plus. Ability to use a ""local"" task list so one can have tasks which only show up on your device and not on a synced business application like Google. Get it",1
"This is a really good calendar app with few ads, but I have a small gripe. I was using this before the option to reschedule recurring events for individual days became hidden behind a paywall (presumably), and now I only have the options to either reschedule all of the events, or all future events. This is very inconvenient, but otherwise I like the app very much.",1
"Good app, great wodgets, almost perfect. Lost a star because the notification types aren't very customizable and it's very easy to miss them. I wish they could put notifications on the lock screen or have them more persistent. The best they do is slide down as a banner for a moment then disappear. if notifications were more robust and customizable, this would be the PERFECT calendar app, well worth the money.",1
"This is really well-designed and overall I really like it. My only complaint is that there's no option to sort tasks manually - the app only lets you sort by date, title, or priority, so I'm going to have to figure out some workaround to get my task lists organized the way I need them to be. Other than that, this app is just what I've been looking for. Really nice-looking widgets too (paid version only, though).",1
"I used to love this widget but the last update or so has made the lines smaller in the daily and agenda views. It now cuts off the very top of the event titles. I am able to read it but the events are so smooshed together it makes it more difficult and not neat looking like it was. There is no setting I can find to fix this issue. Overall the calendar is great, I just don't like the new widget updates at all.",1
Been using for years. Like the widget better than the Google calendar. Unable to delete a single post of a reoccurring event. I have my work schedule for every day of the week and if I try to delete one then I have to delete all. Waiting for developers response. Maybe I am doing something wrong. UPDATE: After installing google calendar and syncing then the ability to delete a reoccurring event shows up. Life is better and I dont have to find another calendar app.,1
"I would like this app better if it would distinguish between the days more definitively, if the graphics to do so were more bold. It is hard to distinguish between the days, and I can't find a way to make it better. The older version did this, and I liked that better, but the older version would not show ""no event days"", this one does. Otherwise, this version has some improved features, such as being able to set, for example, the 2nd Wednesday of every month, which the other version could not.",1
"I use this calendar mostly just because it offers me the ability to adjust the transparency of it as a widget on my android phone. I use the free version so I get the ads and popups when adding items to my schedule. Annoying but understandable. The only complain I have is that I can't edit the calendars in the app so I often get multiple reminders for one event. IE; FB contact birthdays & Gmail contact birthdays. I love that I can customize it to keep my ""to-do"" list and my agenda in one place.",1
I was looking for an alternative to google calendar and I think this may be it. My only issue is that it doesn't always display all calendars. I can go to accounts and see it has reverted back to sync off. It may or may not be a S9 flaw which got me thinking that was probably what was wrong with google. The rating is because I have to go pro in order for location to populate when entering appointment. Google i do not,1
"Honestly after about 20 calendar apps I just gave up and settled on this one. I wish it would stop applying changes to every calendar I have on my phone though. The overall lay out and interface is great, but the highlighted calendars applied at the bottom of the app decides what calendars it wants to add, and that becomes annoying",1
"The UI is the best of the calendar apps I've tried. There are full-screen ads though, which is quite annoying and disruptive. I dropped the app when those were introduced, but I couldn't find one I liked better so I'm back. I'm still salty about the full-screen ads, but if you can put up with them or don't mind paying, it really is a nice app.",1
"I really like this app but it has some weird issues. Set as a widget, it'll list multiple events on the same day. Example; 3 or 4 entries as ""Independence Day"", & no way to delete them. Not linked to multi-accounts, shows all no matter what. Very frustrating. Other than that it's good for quick calendar entries, that's why it's staying. ***edit*** Going to ""settings -> appearance -> filter duplicate events"" gets rid of them. Just don't have muliltiple, exact same entries on the same date. 4* now",1
I really love this calendar and use it daily. I love its many features. I like that it coordinates with TASKS which moves tasks automatically to the next day if not accomplished. The only reason I am not giving Business Calendar 5 Stars is that from time to time it will drop an appointment and that bothers me! I missed an appointment the other day because of it! It wiped out some birthdays last year. That really aggravated me! I don't know why this happens.,1
"I would happily give this a 5 star rating if somebody can please explain how to make the default reminder for event to always be turned on and always set to 0 minutes. I have already missed a customer deadline because the reminder didn't go off at the scheduled time due to the fact the reminder was turned off even though I didn't touch anything. I've done tests and the reminder is so weird, sometimes it automatically sets with 0 min, sometimes with 30 mins, and sometimes it won't even set at all",1
"Way better than stock Android Google Calendar. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the location field can't recognize websites. With all of us having meetings with video conferencing more and more, I'm often putting the Zoom or Teams or other Video Conferencing URL as the location, and when I click, Business Calendar 2 tries to open the URL in Maps. Ugh. Can a future version please recognize URLs and open them in a browser or video conferencing app?",1
"Just oownloaded then started using. Looks good so far. One thing it really needs is the ability to delete a custom reminder time. I accidentally created one for 15 days instead of 15 minutes. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app just to get rid of it. Also an option to swipe left or right to change the view to agenda, month, week etc would be good",1
It is very easy to make an appointments with color coding,1
"It's a great app but, when adding a new event from the wigit, it often saves it as occurring a day earlier than intended. As long as you're aware of this and double-check every time you add an event it's fine, but it would be even better if this issue could be addressed by the developer.",1
"Excellent app. Never an issue until today, while at my medical appointment, I was making the next appointment for the first week of July. Inexplicably, my monthly widget showed July 4th as being on a Tuesday, the girl making the appointment for me said no, it's on a Thursday. I verified it said July 2024, showed it to her, she said yea, it's wrong. Opened app, month view was correct. How can this happen? The widget was showing the 2023 day/date info? I wish I grabbed a screenshot.",1
Sufficient for my needs. Rare ads are at an acceptable level for a free app.,1
It is very easy to make an appointments with color coding,1
"This is a simple-to-use, efficient calendar app. My only complaint is that it seems impossible to stop reminders for calendar entries. I run multiple calendars simultaneously, and have tried everything I can find to stop notifications. My defaults for every calendar are set to no notifications, and I have tried everything I can find through Google, and it still creates 2 notifications on every new calendar entry. After a few minutes, notifications can be deleted but it's still annoying.",1
"I've been using this calendar for a couple of years now, and I'm satisfied with it. It does everything you need and more, and is very customizable. I have a few quibbles about interface behavior, especially the akward activity list pop-up in the monthly view (I'd prefer a separate panel instead, like the Samsung calendar has), and the drag-to-copy feature is clumsy and error-prone, but I can live with them.",1
"Other than the ads, I'm happy with this app. Keeps me organized!!",1
"An essential app for productivity. I use it as a calendar and a to-do list at the same time. Does everything I'd require. Though there are a few noncritical oversights, usually about widgets, like subtasks having colors different from the main task, or the widget still hiding completed tasks (but not completed subtasks) although ""Hide completed tasks"" is unchecked in its settings.",1
Very good App. I especially appreciate the App and Widgets. An issue for me is the event colors are not synchronized with the Google web calendar.,1
"indispensable, and worth the paid upgrade-- keeps my life in order. Sometimes the auto fill and auto correct does unfortunate things, but that could be the user. üòé I like the way it simplifies my life by integrating with Outlook and Google calendar. would like the 'task' concept to be more flexible, a wish list of activity that would carry forward if not marked as complete.. that would be useful",1
"Very good app. Helps me keep organized, and does not let me forget anything. Also, syncs with the google account so I don't miss any dates. I would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app, so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly, to achieve milestones and to track them. This app would become exceptional and dependable. Thank you, I know you will ponder my suggestion üôèüèªüòä",1
"Fantastic UX! This app became my main calendar app. I only suffer from poor integration with Outlook (in order of importance) : 1. No Outlook tasks appear in the task list. 2. All calendar folders from my account are displayed like single calendar, no separate visibility or colors (while Google calendars have them separated). 3. Categories assigned to events are ignored. 4. Free/busy does not support Tentative status. Other than that - good work! Hopefully Outlook will find smoother run one day!",1
"Love this app. It is almost perfect. The only additional feature that i would like to see is the ability to fold tasks. I like to see the tasks in the Day view. Currently they all tasks are shown in a single list, including sub-tasks. This soon becomes unmanageable and impossible to see on a single screen. It would be great to have the ability to nest tasks and fold up the sub-tasks so that only the parent is visible.",1
"The app has a nice amount of customization, a good variety of widgets and the notifications are very informative about the events. On the other hand, it lacks the possibility of setting standard reminders for each calendar separately (e.g.: reminders a week before for entries on a ""Tests"" calendar; reminders one day before at 10pm for entries on ""Doctor Appointments""). This could perhaps be done with templates, but since it's behind the Pro version I wasn't able to try.",1
"Quite usefull app, easy to use. The only serious issue I have is snoozing and discard options - no way to apply with single button, like 'unlock phone', had to click at least 3 buttons and it keep annoy when app play sound being on background. Also there is a bug when first notification happened than you change time but next notification play regardless.",1
Great app. Like anything new it took some time to adapt but I really like the ease of use. Would recommend I didn't need something designed with lots of pointless additions that someone has decided would be important I needed simple to use. I rejected two apps before this one because they were ridiculously difficult to use.,1
"I loved this app, but some update slowed it down tremendously to the point that its becoming unusable. I've tried deleting old tasks and events but it's still lagging all over the place. This saddens me, because this app was my daily driver and I was about to purchase the premium version. but now I'm looking for alternatives. I'm using an LG G6 that runs smoothly. Please try to improve your performance or revert whatever changes were made that impacted it. Thank you.  Edit: I've tried re-installing, clearing cache, checking how much memory is used (I have 4 gigs and this app's usage is negligible). The lagging started happening after I updated the app. I've now downloaded an older version APK from December 2018. This version runs smoothly like before the update. I'm not sure which update is the one that made the app unusable, since I skipped a few. My main problem is that on the month view, the scrolling is laggy, adding tasks is laggy, everything is laggy. Also, sometimes, for no reason, tasks copy themselves to a new task that is planned for ""all day"" instead of a specific time. I'll up my review from 3 stars to 4. I might try to update again in a few months.",1
"Now with outlook support, the best organizer ever! I just wish we could set shorter sync periods. Now the shortest in the settings is one hour. Tasks have a long delay to be shown (sometimes until I sync manually)",1
"I was very close to transitioning to using this app and buying the paid version. The integration with my Google Calendar is great, but Google Tasks is not. The time and other details don't sync, which the devs did clarify is a limitation of Google's API. I appreciate the info density, but the UI just feels cramped, IMO. Great app; would strongly consider again if a web or a cross-platform app is made, or if/when Google lifts their API limitations.",1
"I find copying or moving appointments to be a little cumbersome, but otherwise it's intuitive, easy to use and at this point I completely rely on it as an essential tool on my phone.",1
"The app is great. I'm currently using it as a driving instructor to keep a private diary of when I'm taking learners on lessons. The only thing I'd love to see is the ability to automate an SMS template like: ""Hey [Name], just a reminder that your lesson is at [date/time]."" and have that send automatically a few hours before the start time would be phenomenal ‚ò∫Ô∏è I used to use Goldie for that, but they want ¬£30 per month which is extortionate!",1
"I've just installed this otherwise great app to my phone after factory reset, it connected to my calendar with no problems, but for whatever reason it says in tasks ""You don't have any tasks. Good for you..."" But a quick glimpse to tasks in my Google Calendar on PC reveals I have two overdue tasks. So there is a glitch with tasks apparently.

"this app had been good to me for years, but this latest update messed up all of my appointments. the view is botched - making it difficult to see what's actually on there. once this weird view glitch is fixed, it's back to 5 stars for this app.",1
"Great app - with plenty of features and customisation. Just one question: in the description, it says ""includes watch app, tiles and complications for your watch face"". I have installed the app on my watch (Galaxy Watch 6) and have found the tiles, but why don't I see any specific complications for the watch face?",1
"Good clean intuitive interface, unfortunately like most calendar apps, the widget doesn't always update automatically.",1
"Good app, would be great to have the ability to display a few lines of event description in the agenda widget.",1
"Have experience a seemingly technical inability to change colors for my event themes. Also, experiencing duplications when I edit repeat events. I haven't found a solution to either glitch.",1
"This is one of the apps that I've used for the longest time. It has a lot of flexibility and features. But I think the UI needs to be updated for a more modern look. Also, qukckly swiping through month view used to be very precise but not anymore.",1
5 star because it does what is says and is a really good calendar. I purchased it but no longer need it because I already have the Samsung calendar already installed. I thought it'll be better but I think I'm just used to the samsung app that I default to it. It's a great app and very good at organizing. I recommend even though I don't need it. I do not regret purchasing it in the first place.,1
"Despite the flaky looking icon, this is the best calendar app for power users. Lots of configurability means you customize it exactly to your liking. I wish it were available on desktop/laptop computers. (-1 star for the flaky icon.)",1
"Generally a very nice app. However, I am disappointed that the""filter duplicate events"" feature is no longer working for me, and it was that feature that I got it for in the first place.",1
"Could you please create a watch face (watch face is NOT a watch app) with events and tasks? Reference: outlook, sectograph.",1
Good app with lots of customizations,1
"This app is the perfect way to stay organized. Especially with getting married this year, I was getting overwhelmed and losing track of deadlines and items to complete. This app helps me keep track of everything as summarized or as detailed as I want. And being able to have different lists / sublists helps me keep everything organized as well. Simple to use app yet gives me full control over my tasks, priorities, and deadlines. Edit: As a developer I enjoy your responses to negative reviews üòÇ",1
"All the features + helpful YouTube tutorials I read a number of lists while trying to find certain features. For me it was important to have timestamps for when a item was created and completed, and a way to search tasks and tags. This app also features subtasks, reminders, and calendar view. Definitely check the website and YouTube tutorials! I had an email drafted, but checked there first and every question was answered. I bought an annual subscription, but I can see moving to lifetime. Thx",1
"When you figure out how to use it, it's a great app!",1
Good,1
"A help function would be helpful. Or if there there already is a help function, making it easy to find, would be helpful! How to make a list of things to do is not self evident. I thought I was making a list of things to do, only to find I made a title or catagory of a list of things to do (hopefully that makes sense). Only had this for a few minutes and there is a learning curve for most software so will see how it goes. Aha! Found the help function. Thanks. I also discovered how to delete the ""categories"" I started, instead of a list of tasks. At this time, this app has been helpful. Upgrading to another star.",1
"This app has helped me stay focused and helped me prioritize my tasks. It's easy to use and therefore I use it where as many I have tried are too complicated. If I could change one thing about it I would have a section where just today's tasks were listed separately so that it's easy to figure out which are today's tadks, which haven't been done yet, and which are future tasks.",1
"I really like this app and it works really well! However, my only complaint is that the desktop version requires a subscription instead of being free just like the app. Still the app is really amazing and does exactly what I need to do I've done a little bit a lot of other organizing apps and they haven't really work as well as this one has.",1
"This would be a great application if only it had the ability to add task paths to the list in calendar view. Some of my subtasks don't make sense without including the main task from where it came. Also it would be really wonderful if I had the ability to sort by more than one criterion. Otherwise, it's pretty cool !",1
Is easy to use and helps very much to reach different goals using the task lists I've created,1
I love this app.. I'm inclined to purchase the 1year subscription however there doesn't seem to be a sure way to set up or access account information like a linked email which was problematic when I got the month subscription and switched to a different phone.. Besides that this app is everything I needed .. Perfect for ADHD folk that have lists within listsüòÇ Well made app!,1
I really like this app and all the features. I would even pay for the app but for the extras offered having it as a monthly/yearly subscription is too much money. The lifetime fee is too much for this type of app. As long as I can get what I need without the high subscription fees I'll be happy.,1
Intuitive and oh my god! So beautiful!!! The things that I was looking for but couldn't find: a way to create a recurring task (pay utility bills etc) and a view where I could look at all the tasks I need to get done by today or are overdue. Will stick around to see if these are supported but like the app otherwise :),1
"So far it is pretty good. Alarms, sub lists, calendar, and beautiful colors. The only thing it's missing is a way to save your tasks from phone to other devices. For instance, a login feature would allow your work to be archived no matter what.",1
"I've been using rhis app for a few weeks. I have a Pixel 2 XL. Pros: Great app. User friendly. Easy to use & group tasks. I love that you can rearrange tasks bases on your preference. Im an entrepreneur with many projecrs and it def keeps me on track. Cons: I wish it could track the amount of time I spend on each major task & sub task, like a time clock. Is this a possibility in Q1 or Q2 of 2020?",1
"Honestly, I've had problems with organization most of my life. No matter what planner or app I try, I just can't do it. I still have to get used to the interface but so far this app has been TONS more helpful than any others I've tried. 4 stars just because I'm getting used to things and getting my feet wet. But hopefully when I figure it all out I can give a more thorough review lol",1
I finally found this app after much searching. It's easy to use & has color choices to differentiate lists from one another. It would be even better if I could post my current working lists open on my home page for easier reference. I have multiple lists & things to remember lists going all the time that I need to refer back to. Any chance of adding this feature?,1
Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.,1
"I really like this app. I like the design, the ui/ux. It has most of the features I want, but there is one thing that is keeping me from switching and using the app. I cannot make repeated tasks that have an All Day due date and no reminder. It seems all repeated tasks must have a due date with time and reminder. This is the only thing that is keeping me from using this app.",1
So far I am enjoying having all my tasks in one place. I will see how I am with the App at the end of the month.,1
Simple to start lists and keep track of what has been completed. Using thr free version it delivers exactly what I need.,1
Nice application,1
Great little app to keep me on track.,1
Really helps keep on task with brain fog.,1
It is very useful,1
Out of all tasks/to do apps ive tried the best and free. But please add to the repeat cycle the option to choose on which days to repeat,1
"Very useful. One time payment of subscription is high. If reduced , may be, many people opt for this option.",1
"Find this useful. Works well for me. I got a new phone a few weeks back and found by giving a small donation I was able to transfer all my tasks to my new phone. To be honest I am unlikely to have donated without the push but it was ""less than the cost of a coffee"" and so worth it. Many thanks to the developer.",1
Helps me keep up with things that I have to do.,1
Very easy to use!,1
"Thank you for this well-made program, it is really useful, but I don't know why the previous versions worked better for me, I deleted the app and installed it from other sources, but the problem was still not solved. In any case, thank you for your good work.",1
"I'm an ADHD check-off-girl. I love checking things off on my lists of things to do - it's positive evidence of my productivity and it makes me feel like I'm making progress. Tasks does this for me. It's simple, only essential bells and whistles like calendars, and reminder alarms. It's also straightforward, easy to understand, and intuitive in it's use. I'd add a few more check off features, but it works great for me as is.",1
Awesome app. One request ... Add drag and drop repositioning of items in list. Move to top and move to bottom is bothersome.,1
Finally an app that does almost everything I need! I've probably tried a dozen but this one feels right. I like to be very organised and goal-oriented every day. This app lets me do that. Is there a feature for recurring tasks rather than inputting the same tasks each day?,1
"Really good ,very user friendly,",1
Hourly reminders not regenerating,1
Simples ..saves on post its for sure,1
"I have used a lot of different ""to-do list"" apps in the past, and this one is the very best of all of the ones I have used. My one problem with this app is that if you accidentally delete a to-do item, say you slide it off the screen, and cannot hit the undo button before it disappears, the only way to get that item back on your to-do list, is to copy and paste it or retype the item. There should be a way to restore an item from the deleted file.",1
"I like the app. Inputting tasks is super easy. I can make lists related to school, home, work, etc, which is great. I wish I could have the widget available in different sizes (ie wider so I can read my task or most of it from my home screen). 2x1 isn't big enough for anything really, in my humble opinion.",1
"It is good, and the option of sub-tasks is very useful. It is a little difficult to mesh with the calendar app--having its own cakendar may be a good step, since it is easierand faster to schedule tasks than my Android calendar app. I don't think I've figured out how to make a recurring event. Thank you, hope this helps with the app, and God bless!",1
"Great app and easy to navigate! I haven't really used it to its full capabilities yet, however, for the five things I use this app for, it's out of this world compared to my plain notes. This app makes it super easy to stay on top of my tasks and duties throughout my day, week, and year. Would recommend to someone who's looking to become organized or for an individual who is already organized that just needs a little more routine in their life.",1
"This app is really nice and useful. Helpful by creating task lists and check lists. An improvement that would be especially useful, would be the ability to create a task list on one device and then easily synchronize it to another device. For example, between a phone and a tablet. Thank you for a very useful application.",1
Works great at keeping me organized. I have not had it long so I will have to explore the features. Update-New phone. I can now use the microphone to add tasks. This app is just smart enough. I use it as my own personal to do list separate from Google Tasks which I use for work. It's simple with just enough features and not all the predictive noise threaded through all Google apps.,1
"Great app for writing down things you need to do and stay organized. Love how I can put the widget on the home screen and use it from there. Also like how I can color code each list and shows when they were created and completed. Good thinking. Dont think I can back up my info/tasks to save for later, but it's a pretty great useful app.",1
"If you like alarms as reminders because they harder to ignore (versus that God awful persistent setting), just know that you can't mark them complete so that they disappear like you can with notifications. They just stay on your task list bright red like they're overdue, which is overwhelming when you need this app to stay organized. You actually have to go into the app & individually mark each of them completed. Would be five stars if you guys could add that! I've only been asking for years üò≠",1
Love this app! I've tried all the other recommended task apps but this is the only one that doesn't try to make you pay by taking away tags and priorites. It's super simple and I'm able to use it as a digital bujo. It's great! Highly recommend. My only hitch is it doesn't link to my calendar. Not a deal breaker but it'd be nice if it would. It'd be 5 stars then.,1
"I'm a busy woman: single mother of two teens, executive assistant to two entrepreneurs, and a college student. Having this app available at my beck 'n call is a Godsend! I keep business tasks, personal priorities, grocery lists, & mommy-to-do checklists readily available through the app. It's having my 'paper brains' organized & conveniently located with the touch of a button. Helps with stress relief too. Absolutely necessary for working mommas!",1
"*Please consider thess fixes, updates* -Option to repeat task until completed -Option for repeating task without having to set a date / time due I am really enjoying this app. The only trouble I am having is that some items that are set to repeat ""daily"" are not showing up in my filtered ""today"" list. I want to be able to complete the same task, each day (like doing dishes). Please let me know how to fix this. I love this app overall.",1
"I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.",1
"It's sadly evident that most to-do list apps are created by people with remarkably little to do. This is a delightful rare exception. Logical, simple but powerful, with all the basic necessities covered and good customization options, this is the closest mobile equivalent to AbstractSpoon's ToDoList available. Edit: Removing one star for the total removal of local backup. Monetization is understandable and deserved, but removal of a simple local failsafe to push (Premium) cloud backup reeks.",1
"LOVE IT, but it needs the ability for additional notifications maybe more reflective of the Microsoft 365 calendar format. You need the ability to highlight each task within the list a different color not just the task list. For example, if I opened my green work list, I would like to have the ability to highlight each task in that list a different color. The priority levels need better visual clarity because the tones of the red, orange and yellow are too similar.",1
"This is the best app I've found since the one I've used for years has gone dead. Would be a stellar app if: The repeat option would show up when creating a task from the calendar view without removing the date and adding it back. This may be because the calendar view is limited. The notifications on repeated tasks seem glitchy. The notification goes off the first day, but doesn't on the next day. Tasks marked as completed on future days revert back to uncompleted the next day. Sometimes tasks get done early. When creating a repeated task, it would be great if there were additional options. Rather than every month or four weeks, how about monthly but give an option for the same day each month, or the same day of the week (ie March 12 or second Saturday of the month).",1
"I use tasks to organize my life, and it's mostly great. Some things that aren't: if I check something off, and something in the near vicinity has sub-tasks, they check themselves off; I can't assign sub-tasks their own date, so I can't effectively plan ahead without having to move the date forward every time I check a sub-task off; if you check off all the sub-tasks, the main task automatically checks itself off, which can be good or not depending on the situation; the calendar filtered task.",1
"I'm using this app for all my recurring reminders that I need to remember that I don't actually want on my To Do list (like fill up water bottle, remind kids to pack their lunches, etc). I've tried several apps; the reason I've settled on this one for those reminders is b/c it will give me a reminder notification EVERY time whether or not I completed it last time. I LOVE that you can select specific days of the week (not just weekly or daily). My biggest concern is it not having cloud backup.",1
"Exactly what I need in a task app...almost. Due dates, reminders, tasks groups, excellent widget. However, lack of integration with Google calendar is a deal breaker for me. I don't like the Google task app nearly as much as this app, but I have to use it to be able to work with my Google calendar.",1
"I like the task set up. I would like even more if it had a percentage bar. I am always doing more then one task. So some tasks are further ahead then other due to stopping and start a different task. But over all I love what it does for me, because of all the task I have. I used to forget one and would remember at later time. And I would lose free time to play caught up.",1
"Almost Perfect... There is one suggestion I would like to make though. I tend to stay up past midnight most nights. I have some tasks are set to repeat every day at a certain time. However, when I complete a 9pm task at 1 am the next day, I don't get my needed reminder at 9pm the day I completed it at 1 am. I would like to see some sort of ""catch up"" system where if a task is not completed one day, it will proceed to the next day in order. I'd add more but limited on characters.",1
"This is a simple no BS task-organization app. I have had this app for three years, and the only real gripe I had with it was that you cannot add tasks from your computer. Seeing as I spend most of my time behind a monitor, I figured I would use something that allowed me to do this. Now that tasks is available as a computer app, i truly have little else to say. Perhaps a Google assistant incorporation would be a worthwhile improvement.",1
"Very easy to use and I love that you can organize your items efficiently in categories. Recurring notices are essy to set up. The only downside is on recurring notices - if you don't mark it complete one day, you won't get the next notice until you fix that. Other than that, I love it!",1
"So far (I only just started using this) so good. The app is intuitive and includes lots of details (like subtasks and notes on tasks). One suggestion, would love to be able to set recurring reminders for specific days (for instance Monday through Friday or Saturday and Sunday). Um, silly question, is there someplace I can see all my tasks in one place? Like a home screen that shows tasks by list color or something?",1
"this app has been working well for me.....i have bee using it the past few weeks and like it very much...but be sure to back up within the app because if you transfer or upgrade your phone and do a general backup....all of your sweat and tears of lists, etc will be gone....there should be a way that the developer can link theapp to general backup functions. other that....its great!",1
"It needs a way to put items like bread, milk, etc. into a list format that way that you can ""keep"" certain items on the list, but still know when you bought it before. Every family buys certain items on a weekly basis & so far the only thing I would change would be that. Keep up the good work & I hope to see more app ideas come out soon.",1
"This is a really great app! The only thing I would change is deleting a task from the list when you swipe it to delete. Right now swiping right turns off the alarm but the task stays in the list until you manually delete it. Edit. In the app, yes, you swipe to delete, but when the alarm goes off, you swipe to dismiss the alarm or swipe to snooze. It woukd be great if, when you dismiss the alarm, it deletes the task.",1
"This app is great. Keeps all my tasks together. The only thing I wish it would do is to not auto-move a task to the next recurring due date once the current due date has past. I wish it would show ""overdue"" tasks or seething like that if the task was not yet completed. If a task is overdue, the once I finally check it completed, then it would move to the next recurring due date. Other than that, I really love this organizer.",1
"I like the variety of things that can be marked, or not, for each task, such as certain days of the week. I'm still trying to figure out repeating daily tasks because sometimes it seems that they check complete themselves if I don't get them done on time. Other times they remain uncompleted. Tasks that repeat once/month don't end up on the right day of the week next month.",1
After a week of use it's almost perfect. A couple features aren't intuitive but I think I've figured it out. I love the widgets! Editing right from my home screen is SO great. 4/5 stars because there's no reoccurring task option and I can't figure out how to hide completed tasks. Thanks for a really fantastic & option rich app!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Easy to use. I like the ability to make multiple lists, it would also be nice to have the option to merge them but maintain the color coding. One issue I have is that with quick ads, the voice command stops after saying one word and has to be restarted.",1
"It is not as intuitive as Google Calendar, but it is less cluttered. The UI allows for more sectional usage to split up your tasks and your day as a result. Edit 1: One of the great parts of this app is the main developer will listen to you and your feedback. I've gotten pretty good service out of the apps themselves (I use this across my phone and on desktop-class browsers). The monthly subscription so far has been a very good value.",1
"Took a few minutes to figure what they meant and how to set up the sub-tasks. But got it. It'd be great if even after deleting an item it started to remember your 'regular' stuff. But otherwise, I am really loving I can split up the things for the grocery store, the things needed for the house, and stuff yet to do...Thanks!",1
I really like how this app gives me the ability to move my tasks around. I also enjoy having the ability to strike a line through what I have done and taking the line away if it is a reacuring daily task. I also appreciate the vast color options for organizing my lists. Great free app! Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"it does its job and its very responsive. i use it to keep track of the games i want to buy for my collection. i like how it shows the date and time of when your task was completed. i think the interface could do with looking a little less cluttered and a little more minimalist, but overall, the app is fast and easy to use",1
"This app works pretty well as far as organizing your tasks are concerned. However, there is no print option. What good is making a list if it can't be printed ?! It recommends Wunderlist...which, as of May, 2020, has been retired. I need to find an app that lets me create several lists; and then enables me to print out all pending tasks regardless of which list they're on. This app is not it.",1
"I like the app but there is one thing that annoys the hell out of me. I use a number of sublists for shopping. Whenever the screen changes orientation or Auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and I have to reopen the one I was working with. Very annoying. Update; My opinion of the app is unchanged, but snarky respones from the developer are uncalled for. I get it, it's free, and I'm not using a lower end device. Maybe find a new hobby if you don't like comments.",1
"Just started , seems good ill add a star if it works out well",1
"Very Useful. The more I use it, the more I find different ways to utilize this app. Mostly I use this for remembering items and planning projects. I also use it for speech layouts in the beginning phases.",1
"I love it. I like that you can move items to other lists, share it to emails and texts, color code and flag items.",1
I am really liking this App. It's keeping me organized and I like the reminder feature.,1
Good useful app,1
Very costomizable and cute. Would buy premium if the price was better :),1
Handy and easy to use,1
"So far so good, I enjoy the lovely vibrant colors and easy to use layout, and the layered functionality. Only been using for a short while, but so far so good.",1
"My wife has gotten good use out of this app and really appreciates all the features that have gone into it. The only issue that has cropped up is a bug that forcibly opens the Google Play Store app whenever she tries to edit a task, blocking her from editing it. She's using an old phone, so maybe the app is just glitchy with the older version of Android, but that phone isn't on the network, so she's been thinking of switching to using a newer phone. Which, unfortunately, will be tedious.",1
"This is an amazing app, but what if we try something like sign in / log in or something like that so I don't lose all tasks even if I'm to change the phone",1
Keeps me organized when I use it. But sometimes I have so much stuff on there I get overwhelmed and can't look at it anymore. Then the lists disappear.,1
Took some getting used to. But fulfills my needs,1
"Enjoying the app and have added lots of categories, tasks, sub tasks and notes. Would love the option to share categories, tasks etc - hubby and I are using it on a large and lengthy joint project and at the moment we both have the app but only one of us has the task lists - a pain when one of us is working and the other wants to complete some of the tasks. Would definitely buy the premium option if it was shareable in some way.",1
It's good and can transfer my lists when got a new phone by paying a one off donation which is fair,1
"So far, I am enjoying and making good use of this app. I wish that it could sync to my Google Tasks, and I'd like to be able to sort a little more granularly, such as by due date, then by priority. Aside from those two things, the app is well designed and logical with lots of customizeable features.",1
"It's helpful and it keep myself organized for invoices to paid, unsual appointment ect...",1
Just started it & so far I like it. It's a bit too easy to delete items but I like how easy it is to drill down from project to task to subtasks. I also love the color codinh of projects.,1
Nice and easy app,1
"Thanks for creating this app. Out of all similar apps out there, this one has the most natural and smooth feel to it. Overall, excellent app experience. I wish to buy the one-time payment but it's so expensive (in my country) and I only need the unlimited tag feature. I wish they would breakdown pricing by feature/component. In that way the total prices would remain the same but more accessible to people without extra cash.",1
"I am a list maker and have things recurring, this list does that. I use this all the time and have several lists created for various aspects.",1
Question - Great app but how do I change the colour of each list?,1
"I've been using this app for a while now, and elected enough to pay for a year, but it took a while to figure it out. There are a lot of options, and not all of them are immediately obvious. Mostly, the confusion for me is hell to handle the recurring tasks and not have it marked as done permanently rather than just for one occurrence. I've got it all working now (I think), but it could have been easier and spelled out better in the help and documentation.",1
"This program has all the ingredients to give it full full marks. However the user interface and intricacies make it complicated to fully master. Also,with only three Tag labels limitation it is asking huge price to get four or more. Config Saving and Restoring worked well except when I changed backup file location. Perhaps I should not have changed the location from it' default.",1
Pls make it simpler,1
"Nice, but cannot sync and backup to google account automatically",1
"Glitchy at times,",1
My first job ever is 3rd shift at a gas station and this app helps me get through my day and get all my tasks done without missing a beat.,1
"UPDATE: I have shown my support, by subscribing. And reviewing. What I'm asking for is some tweaking options. You consider those & I'll consider more stars.***PREVIOUS REVIEW: Works great. Enjoy multiple lists & sublists. Would love to be able to change the set times. They say ""tomorrow @ 10am, 2pm & 6pm"". Would be great if could change to my preferred time choices. Thanks. Using Samsung.",1
Very good very helpful many thanks,1
Difficult to share from phone to tablet but I could share my lists via mail and print them.,1
Good and convenient,1
"I'd wanna give 5 stars but one thing I wish changed is if there was an option make it like the tasks in day gets cleared or gets sent to a different folder after that day finished,whether the task was completed or now.",1
"Great app! I found it when I was looking for an alternative to Evernote. Task is more reasonable in the price for paid features In the future I would like to be able to do in the calendar, what can be done in the other lists Great start for an organizing app! I am a Premium member",1
Simple and effective,1
I love the sub lists as I'm always making lists within lists!,1
"This app is great! But, I feel like there's still something missing... I honestly create a LOT of lists on this app, but I'm also not that great at organising them... what I would absolutely love is to be able to add notes to the lists, sub-lists, and sub-tasks like you can with the normal tasks so that I can write down the details for what a list was for (without making the name of the sub-task or list too long).",1
So far so good. Had to replace Wunderlist and this seems like a good replacement,1
Works well. May even pay them some money for it,1
Nice app.... however doesn't have task repeat feature,1
I like it. It just simply work without distraction of ads and useless options.,1
"Notices go off in middle of night also, overriding do not disturb settings where I've specifically turned it off. Awesomeness otherwise Edit: I know understand setting for am or pm. Try every 18 hours. The permission is ""Notifications"" . Only UNDER Notifications is alarm permission but still a subset of it. Should I have known this App's notifications will bypass Android master DND settings? The app will receive 3 stars if response from customer service is similar to first rude response",1
"I have not used this app for very long, but it is exactly what I was looking for when I did a search: a really good checklist for things to do.",1
Nice app and fairly easy to use .,1
Great and useful app,1
"Love the options to add tags, notes, pics etc. and filter via the tags. My biggest complaint is being unable to hide tags when looking at a list. It makes the list look clunky, and I may have to switch to another app for that reason. I also wish there were other list options such as notes, or list only view (no check marks), etc.",1
Good,1
This is great once you figure out how to make sub-lists.,1
good apps management,1
Very quick to make reminders. Helps me remember things and stay on task.,1
Good app. Easy to organize,1
"Still in the testing phase, but it's the best app I've tried so far, and it's really usable. I think the sublist feature will turn out to be really useful in the end by allowing me to break down tasks into subtasks and something like a grocery list into subitems for a particular dish.",1
Leam More,1
"I really like being organized, because it helps with my focus and to have everything in order. And this app really helps, I love the color coding and the reminders!",1
It's a pretty good app! For me personally it would be helpful if there was an optional reminder to open the app because I will simply not look at my to-do's üòÖ,1
Great app to create lists of virtually anything. Many features are available to tailor your lists.,1
"Just started using, need to spend time learning with their videos to get better use of it. I'd like to be able to transfer lists into other levels, like an outline format. Maybe I'm expecting too much or just don't know how to do what I want yet. Thanks for making this app ad free.",1
Perfect except no coud. Google tasks is better.,1
"Great so far, havent used it too much yet. But excited to see if it is helpful.",1
Occasionally buggy but overall helps me stay organised on a daily basis. Would recommend üëç,1
It's really helpful and organized way to maintain your to do list.,1
"Awesome app, would be great if you could drag and drop tasks from one list to another Replying to your comment: Thanks for the speedy response Steve! Another feature that would be great which I've seen on other apps is having some form of automatic time cascading. At the moment I have to create lists for today, tomorrow (Tues), Wed, Thurs, etc. And when tmw comes I have to move all the items manually to today. If there was some form of auto cascading that would be amazing! Def premium worthy!",1
"Still new to the app, but it's useful and worth trying it out.",1
"Very useful app - particularly helpful to categorise lists and set priorities. One thing that is frustrating me is that I cannot for the life of me figure out how to turn off the daily 9am notification? Not even sure if that's default or something I turned on at some point... Edit: I actually gave 4 stars based on the learning curve for using the app being a bit steep and managing lists not being completely intuitive. The hard work is definitely appreciated, and 4 stars is hardly a poor review!",1
Very useful for reminders.,1
Okaaaay Tasks! Definitely loving tasks....it's easy to use and easy to get to as well!,1
Good,1
Is it available on iphone,1
Very helpful for the forgetful!,1
Easy to use and personalize,1
Ok! no pen zone,1
No problems so farm east to navigate.,1
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this App! It's user friendly & easy enough to just start using upon opening! But for those of us who want more - it's got that too! Several settings options make it truly customizable, and i really like that i can export a simple grocery list, via text message, and send it to my husband at the store!! I use this for my meds, and can save daily lists, export to doc,log notes & pain levels (using priority scale), & tag info for myself. It's so much more then a to-do list!",1
"Nice, practical, simple and straightforward. Easy to sort and reorganize; easy to move items between lists. Only (very minor) complaint is that, when choosing colors for lists, text doesn't stay in contrast: for example, in dark theme, text is white, but if you try to make list yellow or white, text stays white and illegible.",1
"Fairly good product. Easy to create and reprioritize items in a list. Can reorder lists themselves but not as easy to rearrange lists (why?). Easy to move items from one list to another. THING I MOST WISH CHANGED: it should be easier to check and uncheck boxes with out ending up on the ding-dang item edit screen. I'm mostly right handed, I have to reach across the screen to check/ uncheck and it is a 66% likelihood of ending up in the edit screen rather than check box action.",1
"This is a great app to organize and prioritize all your to-do lists. It has worked flawlessly since day one on my Pixel 6a and more recently on my Pixel 2 watch. It does almost everything I have needed, helping remind me of tasks I need to do. I really like the widget on my home screen to see my main list but can easily switch to another",1
"I use this app to keep track of all those things you think of when you don't have a note book, a scrap of paper, the back of an envelope to capture that brilliant idea. Then, OMG, where did I leave that note to myself? Grocery lists, movies, TV shows, books I want to see/read, recommended doctors, places we want to see, etc. How did I ever manage before Tasks?",1
I absolutely love the app! I'm a service Foreman for a road and parks department. We have multiple jobs per day that are constantly changing this app helps me organize all jobs. I bought a Android tablet just for this app to use at work. I upgraded to premium app for the back up capabilities well worth it to me . Hopefully if I ever have any trouble with my tablet this app will be backed up fully just as I have left it .,1
"This app keeps my To Do reminder items and other lists in one place. It has reminders when a task has a due date My grocery list keeps items after they are purchased and ticked off. Next time, just untick items I need to buy again. Customizable lists, urgency, filters, and colors. I love it.",1
"I almost never leave app reviews, but I couldn't not give this app a 5 star review. It's absolutely freaking fantastic. I don't know the team that developed it, but it's become more and more clear as I've used that app that they had a goal. A goal to create the pinnacle of all list and task trackers. Every feature you could ever dream of has been included in this app. They thought of everything. And let the actual user decide and customize if they wanted to use it.",1
"LOVE it. I prefer writing lists, but this app's features were worth switching: multiple lists/sublists, reorganizing items, move completed to bottom, can still view what you've accomplished. I can also re-use lists, such as packing for travel, instead of re-writing every time and forgetting to put items back on a list. I can access these lists instead of relying on my brain to give me just 85% of the answers. I use for daily, weekly, and collecting ideas over months. Should've installed sooner.",1
"Free version is actually helpful, no annoying adds. I highly recommend this app. 12/2/2023 update I've used tasks for 3 yrs. It reminds me either daily, weekly, or monthly. Highlighting important tasks and red flagging them make sure that I know what my first priority is for the day. I suggest l that they allow uploading your list so when you switch phones your lists downloads to the new phone. I found this app so useful that I upgraded to their paid version. It's definitely worth it!",1
"I have been using this app for several months now. It has helped me tremendously with organizing my many chores and reminders. I just messaged a suggestion for repeating tasks to show the last time the task was completed, which I feel would help alot when organizing priorities. Other than that request / suggestion, I have no critique for this app. It is wonderful! I highly recommend it! üòä",1
"This app is beyond helpful when it comes to trying to organize what I need done throughout the day and keeping things organized! It even allows subtasks for me to see what all needs to be done to complete a task before checking it off. It allows for multiple lists which I can color code, sort through the tasks I have, and even set alarms and priorities. I do wish I could sort completed tasks from uncompleted instead of hiding completed tasks, but overall, this app has been beyond helpful!",1
"I've been using Tasks for about 3 years now. I absolutely love it! I used to write to-do lists out on paper. But when I would misplace a list,my life would go astray. Seriously. I have adult ADHD and have learned that I forget things that aren't written down very easily. This app has helped me stay organized in a major way. And I get a pinch of happiness every time I delete a task off the list. That good ol' dopamine boost. Great job on the app!",1
"Best app I have found for my ADHD brain! So many apps target people with ADHD these days and they are NOT helpful. This simple, but extremely modifiable app is exactly what i need to keep things straight day-to-day and long-term. I have a list for ""today"" and a list for ""later"" plus others for high-stress priorities. You can add sub-tasks, easily re-order items, color-code, etc. It is so convenient to pull this out when I feel overwhelmed and jot down what's in my head, no stress.",1
"I have tried for years to find a good system for keeping my life organized and I have finally found it with this app! It provides so many free features with no ads and it respects your privacy, so you can try it out and see how helpful, customizable, pleasing to the eye, and intuitive it is to use. It's just awesome. I bought the lifetime version because being able to switch from the phone to the computer is so convenient. Bottom line - this app will help get your life in control with more peace",1
"I needed something to help me and my partner stay on top of housework and it is so easy to set up! I emailed with the question after getting premium and who responds but the owner and creater! They were thorough in their response, quick and kind. My partner and I have both gotten premium now and are making use of this app and I absolutely adore it. Thank you Steve for a wonderful app experience with no adds, no selling our data and a beautiful interface. Be kind to yourself!",1
"This is one of the best 'to do list' apps I have found. Mainly because of it's simplicity. It doesn't want to connect to your contacts or any other apps, doesn't need to know your location or need something running in the background (unless setting an alarm of course). Thank you for keeping it simple. If you do think you need all that, please call it TasksPro or something and leave this version simple.",1
"I've tried over a dozen similar apps and this one is by far the best. I rarely leave reviews, but Tasks has definitely earned it. I have adhd & my brain is a mess but Tasks has been helping A LOT. I set reminders for all my family's appts, keep a running list for groceries & home shopping, and I've even just started a Christmas shopping list. The free version is so helpful already, but I'm almost tempted to try the premium version to see what it's all about. Highly recommend...thank you!",1
I have never rated an app before. I rave about it to others. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and options to customize. I love having the widget on my phone. I expanded it so I can see many items on my list. I love the different options for reminders and snoozing. I have a hard time transitioning from task to task. Only thing I struggle with is the manual reorder of tasks (hold and drag). Works better for moving tasks down than up. Maybe my screen is not responsive enough or I'm clumsy.,1
"This is by far the best task app out there! Great widgets and reminders settings. Adding quick tasks is a snap and there are multiple ways to do it. Fully customizable. The thing just works! Wished I didn't have to change so many things out of the box, but hey, we all have different needs. Keep up the great work!",1
"Great app! Support is superb. Only needs a few things and it takes the cake (still much better than most task, alarm apps): alert sounds per task, ascending volume options, templates. I was reminded by the developer I can simulate by duplicating a task (create a list called templates- duplicate then move to another list/sublist).",1
"Hi Steve, vibes again w/ settings off. Prob my phone. Fav feature: choose snooze time when alarm sounds, works flawlessly! Found alarm duration in settings üëç. Couldn't understand how the filter for history works. The to-do page is confusing. It's organized by date, irrelevant of today's date, so when i see it i get overwhelmed and can't understand what alarms are coming up. Probably my brain.",1
I have found this to be the best management app so far. The option to have multiple lists and sublists for all the different categories in life. Being able to add notes really helps simplify many tasks. It has premium features that definitely make it nicer but is perfectly usable for free. Being able to have customizable reminders and due dates for various things without clogging my Google calendar. Tasks are also very easy to update which is very helpful when they don't go as planned.,1
"This program takes Google Tasks to the next level. I keep two lists running. ""Big List"" tracks all jobs, planned and completed. ""Daily List"" extracts and isolates location dependent plans (hopes?) for the day. Task labeling and easy movement of tasks back and forth between these lists is key. Access from separate locations, the reason I bought a lifetime subscription, amplifies the power. This is simple, functional support for planning and advancing multiple complex jobs simultaneously.",1
"Update: I've now used the app > 6 months & love it just as much! My only wish is that the web app was identical. I've just been using this app for a few days, but so far, I love it. It has a huge amount of functionality and is very customizable, but doesn't feel at all complex to learn or use. I especially like the fact that it combines a task manager with a calendar. I got a monthly Premium subscription and will probably upgrade to annual. I only wish I'd found it sooner. Thank you!",1
"Really loving this app so far! Have only been using a little over a month, but it has been super awesome. My spouse randomly (and regularly) texts me paragraph-style lists of what they want to accomplish for the week and I format them into an actual list with this app so I can check things off for them. I also like that I can share the list (with checks and all) when they ask what's left. Thanks for such a useful tool!",1
"This this app is very user friendly. The only downside that I have found so far is that in order for me to have a version on my phone and also a version on my computer I need to get the paid version, which I think is reasonable priced at $1.89 per month (The plan I chose to try out the app) or less expensive for yearly (18.99) or one Lifetime payment 59.00 to use forever. After only a few days, I find this app has way more features than the ""ToDo"" list that I had been using.",1
"This app is brilliant has all the things I want . Allows me to create lists sub lists , make notes and set reminders. One annoying thing is the back button exits the app when you're in a subsist. Would like of it would not let you exit the app and would go ro a root or home page. EDIT: there's a setting for my ask above! Love this app",1
"Best ever! I have been tracking and organizing over 400 tasks over the years. The premium version, which includes tags, has provided me with the ultimate experience in sorting and combining detailed lists that keep me up to date. I don't have to carry around a big daily planner or rely on my failing memory...",1
"Used this app since 2018 and still going strong. It's just simply the best. This is completely for my own amusement, but it would be great to have a tab that shows just the completed tasks within a certain time period. It's nice to just look back sometimes and see what I have accomplished in the past few days. Also, it would be great if there was a toggle to auto-delete completed tasks after they have been completed for a week.",1
"I have tried sooo many scheduling/ planner apps this isby far my favorite! It's easy to use, perfect for keeping up with multiple college courses and their assignments, super easy to add new tasks through the widget. I just wish it was available for Apple devices also so I could see my schedule on my computer too!",1
"Great app, its simple and easy to organize. I have a bunch of tasks and I like that I can separate them in different categories. Wouldn't change anything, except to add a deadline timer feature if I wanted to make sure I did a task by a certain time. That's just a thought, its a perfect app as it is!",1
"Ok here's why I absolutely adore this app. Talk about organized and being able to get some stuff done üëç if that is your goal then for real, down load this app. I am big on time management and being punctual, this app definitely has me on point ‚òùÔ∏è üòé it pretty much manages my daily stuff and helps me to remember things I would probably put to the back of my mind when I know those things should be at the front. Love it can't live without it!!!! üíì",1
"12/23 Update: Still loving it 18 months later! This app helps me keep my life organized! I have been using it for a few months and I love so many things about it. The widget is awesome, you can complete or snooze a task right from the notifications, and I can even complete a task from my Galaxy Watch 4. Responsive developer too! I'm off to upgrade to premium to support his excellent work. I can't recommend this app enough.",1
"I tend to greenlight a lot and end up forgetting a lot of things I need to do. This helps a lot with that cuz of what it has for organization: Lists, sub lists, tasks, and subtasks. Its got the works. I like that kind of organization tbh. AND it has repeated reminders which is pretty neat and didn't expect this to have.",1
I love this app! I was constantly losing my paper lists and was pretty half hearted about even accomplishing what was listed. This app is really helping so much with focusing and feeling productive! It took a little bit for me to figure out the best way to use the tasks and sub tasks but after a couple of days it clicked!,1
"I've tried ever app available and this is by far the most functional while also being the easiest to use and more attractive interface. the pro plan is a bit steep in price, but there are very few restrictions without it. you could easily donate a few dollars to help and are still getting the most fully featured list/todo app on Android. things you can do that most apps can't.. Move items between lists and subslits. Have sublists. lots of color customization. quick entry. full export to csv.",1
"Amazing! I've been looking forever for an app like this. It is packed with countless options like adding notes and photos or other attachments; lots of ways to sort lists; sublists; reminders and deadlines; etc. At the same time, it is so simple and easy to use and understand. I synced across devices. Definitely way better than iphone Reminders and Google Tasks which don't have most of the options here. I just wish it were available as an app for iphones too.",1
"Omg this app really helps keep me organized! I like that I can make my own categories for each task (Groceries, Home Errands, Town Errands, etc). I can make each category a different color/shade. Its simple and you can make it into a timer, reminder or level of priority. Its not complicated like other apps that have useless and stressful options that people don't need or can't understand. I highly recommend this if you are looking for something simple but create it to your liking!",1
"I love that you can turn on a setting to hide completed tasks. It makes getting things done that much more satisfying! Mark as done and *woosh* they disappear! There is also just enough customizability without being overdeveloped. Really quite a tidy little app. I switched phones and tried out the preloaded notes app, couldn't stand it for more than a day before I had to track down Tasks!",1
"I searched for years.. downloading and eventually having to uninstall due to the To Do app not having ability to have sub lists, prioritization, flexibility to organize my thoughts the way I think.  this is super flexible and easy..   if you liked the app and it helped you save time and organize my tasks... than you should donate to the individual that created this so he can continue to make improvements.  well worth it!",1
"Love this app! So customizable. So easy to use and have all my tasks in one place. I struggle with ADHD/remembering tasks and have usually had multiple notebooks with scattered to-do lists. This app allows me to finally have it all in one place, create sublists, color code by level of importance, sort and move things around easily (a feature so appreciated in any type of organizing app). I honestly love this app.",1
"This app is great for making detailed lists. I use it to keep track of my monthly bills, daily to-dos, future plans, and basically everything in my life. The sublists and customizable colors are a HUGE plus for me. And I love that you can mark things off and choose what happens to them (strike-thru, disappear, etc.). The feeling of making progress by marking something off a list is an instant serotonin hit haha. All-around great app to keep you organized and help you plan your life!!",1
"A really amazing app! All the other task list apps I tried just didn't work how I would have liked them to, but this one helps me with everything! It's got a simple and easy to organize interface, along with app customization and different sets of reminders for each seperate task and list; everything has worked perfectly so far, and I definitely recommend!",1
"I love this app! Does what I need, and it is very customizable. 10/10 I want to report a small bug, though. I changed the settings so that new tasks have reminders by default. When I add a new task from the text box at the bottom (quick add new task), it doesn't have a reminder by default. New tasks that I add from the '+' button do have reminders, though.",1
"Absolutely love this app. Have a list for what my ideal morning looks like, a list for what needs done around the house, & a lost of projects I want to tackle, along with sub lists of the parts for those projects. Can be as simple or complex as you want. The only thing I regret is having spent money on other apps, & not having found Tasks sooner. Most intuitive & versatile to-do list I've ever used.",1
"It's wonderful for not only taking notes but also organizing them. It even allows you to break down each goal so that you do not miss a step. My one issue is that once you add all your tasks, the app does not allow you to reorganize them. For instance, if you needed to do the last item you inputted first, you can not move it up on the list.",1
"I'm a chaotic mess and this app helps a lot. It comes with snooze, annoy the hell out of me, sub routines, calendar tasks, and so much customizability it's insane. If I were to build an app, this is EXACTLY how I would want it. Truly amazing and worth checking out if you struggle with executive functioning. I'm broke rn but I'll donate when I can. Also, no ads or annoying pop ups even though I'm a free user.",1
"It's as complicated or as simple as I want it to be, and has neat options for customization that keep things further organized. Interacting with the app was intuitive within five minutes of digging into its features, and having it as a widget on my Android phone is a massive plus-- it's one less step towards accessing my lists. Fantastic app. Keep up the good work!",1
great app for keeping up with my needs. gave it 5 stars but I feel it lacks In 2 areas. I use it more for a list then a task manager. best app I've found so far and I've used alot. I would like to see a photo adding option and a grid view. these 2 things coupled with the share option and how its displayed to the recipient would be amazing. still my favorite list app so far though.,1
"I love how there's Light/Dark/Black modes to choose from, which helps with eye strain; there's the ability to pick a color for the lists you make from the 'pie' of colors available, but also customize the shade of color from there with the side below the 'pie'; you can also set reminder alarms right away or later/as needed; and after searching through many apps for task lists out there, this is the one that feels most user-friendly and generally *useful* in daily life for me.",1
"Fantastic task app! I was looking for a comparable alternative to Any-do, and finally found it. I was specifically seeking similar snooze options as Any-do, and this app has them in ten-fold. One can even customize their snooze options should the app defaults not suffice. In addition, there are a plethora of functions and options available for each reminder and list created. Therefore, I am happy to say I was finally able to uninstall and delete my Any-do account without any reservation.",1
I looove looove looove the app!! It does what I need it to. I can add widgets to my homescreen so I can easily see my to do list and add to it. It's free. I haven't seen ads when I log in. I can reorganize and add different types of lists. For myself it's morning routine. Night routine and weekly chores. I can easily check them off on the widget and it resets after midnight. Definitely worth the 5start and download!,1
"I grabbed this app as a replacement for Wunderlist, as that one's closing. It's a great app for keeping all my thoughts organized in one handy, colorful yet uncluttered space. Pleeenty of personalization settings you can choose from, or use it as-is, which is enough for my needs so far. Best, no ads! That alone encourages me to pay for premium. Developer seems attentive and enjoys the work - keep it up! Thanks! EDIT: meant to give it 5 ‚≠ê",1
"The app is really good for what I need. I like how reminders are free and I can repeat them daily, weekly, on a custom schedule, among other choices. The UI is very good overall aside from me getting a bit tripped up initially trying to add a recurring item. I like how I can customize the colors of different lists as well as the background color. There's still a lot of preferences and settings to play with and tune but I like how customizable the app is. Definitely a lot of work put into it.",1
"Daily to do lists keep us moving toward excellence, large accomplishments are reached through daily tasks. This app is very helpful in keeping my vision before me. It's user friendly, versatile and allows you to easily reorder and edit your list. I love checking off my finished tasks, it's wonderful to glance at what all I've gotten finished and be reminded of what to focus on next. Thanks developers!",1
"Does everything I need a todo list to do without a lot of BS extra features. Organize tasks into lists and sublists, tasks can be recurring or one-time, due dates and times, it's easy to enter tasks and easy to mark them complete, I can delete completed tasks or just hide them so that I can look at them later, set task priorities and perhaps best of all, no subscription fee! I happily donated to support such a good and useful app and developer. This is the perfect todo list app for me!",1
"The greatest thing about this task app is that it allows you to not only list the things you need to do, but also break down a task into smaller parts. I'm an occupational therapist and activiy analysis is a crucial skill in therapy. This app can be used with special needs children in the teaching process, with seniors to achieve more independents in daily function, students of any age when learning something new, all kinds of organising. This app is thorough! Well done! Wish it was available for fire tablets.",1
"I use this app for EVERYTHING!! To do lists, meal planning, work tasks, you name it, I've got a list for it. The app is absolutely awesome! You can set tasks to recur at almost any frequency, add notifications, alarms, or just have a to-do list to check off. I can not recommend this app enough! It's a godsend if you have memory issues or executive disfunction. I've had this app for several years and never had one single issue. Download with confidence and start your lists! Bonus, no ads!",1
"I love this app and would, and have, recommended it to people who forget chores or errands. I myself favor this in all other apps I've sampled. I want to note the simplicity in the UI which allows users to set very precise and/or complex instruction without needing a ten minute tutorial. My favorite part, is that all the essential features are absolutely free. Many similar apps, or even apps outside this genre, if you will, almost punish their free users by making the app useless without payment",1
"Perfect for list-lovers! Super user friendly. For a single working mom, it really helps me to remember all the ideas or tasks that dawn on me at the most random times. I jot it down in my trusty Tasks app, set my reminder, and I'm set. Plus, it reminds me to celebrate seemingly mundane to-do's every time I mark an item completed. I am a fan!",1
"I've been using this for a few days and it's pretty great! I wanted a simple lists app, that would let me move things easily from one list to another, edit task and list names, change the order of the tasks on the list. It does all those things really easily, plus its color-coding feature gives you lots of options. The little things that make boring stuff more beautiful. Also want to do some kind of time blocking. This isn't that (maybe premium? Cld put times in task names?), but nice app : )",1
"9/12/19 morning: I use this app constantly and love it to pieces. It so nicely keeps me organized in all the different aspects of my life and in one central place. It's simple, easy to use, and very effective. The only thing i haven't figured out how to do yet is back it up. If my phone melts down, i lose my lists, or if I get a new phone. Probably this my ignorance just not knowing yet how to do the backup correctly. Thanks for an awesome app. 9/12/19 afternoon: Ok, so Steve, the creator of this app, responded immediately to my comments about backup and showed me exactly how best to do it. You simply take any list you want to back up and go to the ""Share"" icon at the top right hand corner of the list window. Click on Share and then send yourself an email of the list. It comes through perfectly, super simple and fast. Lots of lists don't need back up because they are just ""To Do"" lists of various kinds, but other Lists like ""Things to Remember,"" ""Information to Keep,"" ""Travel Information,"" ""Family Facts,"" etc. are really important to back up especially as time goes by and they build up in content. I am very happy with this solution. Thanks Steve!.",1
"Been using this app for a year now, and have created something like 20 lists that contain sublists, reminders, to-do's, groceries, pretty much anything and everything, and I've been so pleased with the whole experience. In my opinion, this is the best task app for Android, and the developer tries to sort out issues and responds quickly to feedback. I Highly recommend this app.",1
"So far it's been exceptionally helpful. Three things I'd love to see: the date a task was added (to track length of time for completion or to remember when it was added), the ability to include a picture and/or address (linkable to Google maps or Waze or whatever map system one uses), and selective multi-device sync for selective tasks or to do lists (sharable so several people can check off one list if needed).",1
This has been by far the best task app for me. It is very easy for me to stay organized with what I have going on in my life and to help me reach my new year's resolutions. There are only 2 set backs 1. No web version but not to worry as it looks like they are working on it now so yay for the future! 2. Unfortunately for repeating tasks the sub tasks do not uncheck themselves and you have to go through each time and uncheck them to recheck them. Even still this is a wonderful app!,1
"I am extremely hopeful that this is the very last tasks app I will need to try. I have tried way too many, and I really love this one! I like that you can swipe to go to the next sublist. The only thing I would want added is to be able to have the choice of using check boxes, or not, with each list or sublist. I like to write stories, and sometimes just want to quickly jot down some ideas or a small paragraph. Really appreciate this app...thank you! :)",1
"Task app that is everything I imagined it should be. Google's and Microsoft's to-do lists left much to be desired. The custom filter list option is what I have always wanted. The tasks I need to know about are always right on my phone home screen widget. You have done a great job Steve, thank you. You have earned my money because you deserve it and I enjoy the web app for adding tasks quickly while at work. Haven't encountered bugs so far!",1
"I have been struggling to find an app that helps in setting goals for different aspects of my life (ie. school, work, exercise). I use this app to make long-term goals in one tab and smaller goals in another. Being able to make a special tab to see all of my small goals and when they are due keeps me organized. I want to say thank you to the developers! This app is efficient and fun to use!",1
"Good for old person with failing memory. My calendar app was getting cluttered up with recurring reminders, the kind that aren't actually committed times. Also I had a todo list app which was simple and handy. This does both. Todos on separate list come up when I start the app. Options for recurring reminders and notifications are very complete. Excellent.",1
"I'm a list maker, I have been for a long time. It's a skill I picked up to help with anxiety and ADHD. This app has been incredibly ergonomic and fun to figure out; and it's fit right into my life like a puzzle piece. I like well made productivity apps way better than paper journals & planners, because I always have my phone with me, but it can be so difficult for me to remember to take/remember where I put a planner or a pen. I've been loving this app, it's really kept me on track!",1
"Just another one of the folks on here with really bad ADD, stopping around to say this app is great. Easy to use, lets you organize multiple lists, edit due dates, create sub tasks, and then get it to either text or set an alarm to remind you anytime before it's due. I'm so glad I can finally function like a normal person, even with horrible short term memory.",1
"***UPDATE*** Yes, you can create recurring tasks. The developer was quick to respond and help. I installed this for the benefit of priorities. Tasks have a circle next to them that you click to complete. Priority (high, medium, low) changes the color of the circle outline and this isn't really seen. I would give 5 stars if priorities were a number (1, 2, 3) or letter (a, b, c) next to the task. Almost a perfect app",1
"Very useful, with great features. I have grocery lists for the stores I use the most, sorted in order of the position of items in the store aisles. I can check and uncheck the items I want each week and highlight them or flag with different colors. When the stores move things around it is a simple drag and drop to adapt my lists. You can have many different lists and the format is easy too read. Love this, great app.",1
"It is amazing because it doesn't restrict you to make just one type of list or task (example, I can list my to do list with a sub section for phone calls and another for errands and another section separate for my shopping list!). With that being said, it might take a few minutes to understand how to properly use it, but the time that goes into understanding only makes the experience that much better. Love love love it so far!üíü",1
"The widget font size is too small even when the slider is set to max. It doesn't let you check off subtasks in the widget. If you have tasks set to repeat daily and you accidently check off a task, it will automatically increment the time after you uncheck it, forwarding the task to the next day. Edit: Updated rating because Android is the problem not them. However, I would still like for tasks to not increment until after the day has passed. Is this possible?",1
"I have not fully explored the app because I have not needed all of the features. My only issue, thus far, is not being able to share the lists between my phone & tablet. However I did see where you are working on that feature & am super stoked for that update when it comes. I would like to be able to add photos to the different task & subtask sections. It's helpful to use pictures in certain tasks that you're pulling ideas from such as party decor|games or even organization ideas.",1
"I've really been loving this app. I would have given it 5 stars if I was able to share my lists with my boyfriend so he could check the items off on his phone whenever I sent him to the store. It does let me share the lists with him and send it to him in a SMS message BUT it doesn't look like it does on the app and you can't check the items off like you can in the actual app. I heard that if we were paying for this app that it offers that feature. Not totally sure though. Regardless, great app!",1
"Tasks is easy to use and understand; helping me stay organized and on track with what I need to get done. The alarms/notifications for deadlines set is delightful. The only thing(s) I would change is having the option of whether or not to use my stylus pen to write freehand and an option to change colors of the tasks on any given list I make. However, the app in general is wonderful/great/super-fantastic!",1
"Honestly, great app, has many features that help with organizing your thoughtspace and ideas. Very appreciated as someone with semi-severe adhd. However... An incredibly helpful feature that would definitely be appreciated enough to bump up to a five star rating is: Being able to attach an alarm/reminder to look at a specific to-do list on a specific day, repeating weekly, monthly, daily, or just once on a specific day in the current month or week. Get that in and, should I remember, 5* rate4u",1
"I really enjoy using this app to stay organized. The sub list and color options! Sharing a grocery list amongst a house hasn't been easier. Suggestions: different templates or formats to stay organized. For example, I use a hand drawn chore wheel categorized by days, weeks, and months. Circles within circles. Then each ring divided by activity. It would be nice to have this on my phone.",1
"satisfied so far. want to look into how this works across devices (PC, phone, tablet). Update: I definitely like this app real well, but not well enough to pay for syncing across devices when I can do that elsewhere for free. I definitely like the interface. I don't need all of the functionality, so I can't speak to that. Easy to use for what I need it for. Four stars only for the syncing issue.",1
So far so good. Been using this app for a month now and it is so convenient and intuitive. Exactly what I needed BUT I will ask for one fix that is really important for reminders and alarms when traveling: Every alarm or reminder needs an option for what to do when you change time zones. Should the alarm go off based on the time zone when you made it (A business meeting) or same time regardless of location? (Take my meds) I dont want to miss a business call because of travel.,1
"Very nice app. You can organize your reminders into lists and sublists. My only complaint is how the widget looks (it isn't transparent when tasks don't show, so it sort of hides your background photo - just a minor pet peeve of mine), but the overall functionality of the app is great. It also isn't (currently) loaded with ads to the point that every time you click on something, a new ad pops up.",1
"So far, really good. Only, complaint I have, but it feels like a major oversight, is that there is no ""View all"" view. Sometimes (most of the time really) I just want to have all of my upcoming tasks laid out in a single view and not have to switch between lists and sub lists. Lists and sublists are great for organization, but I also want to get a complete picture of what I need to do today or this week.",1
"I really like that I can change the color of each list. The widget is really awesome - I can change to a different list within the widget, without opening the app, and can checkoff tasks in the widget without opening the app. These things seem little but they are important - why have a widget if the app needs to open, might as well just open the app anyway. Interactive widgets - every app needs to have one! Anyway I'm still getting ti know this app but those are my two favorite features so far.",1
"Great potential - just started using this but early opinion is that this app has tons of functionality available and super flexible. Like others, hoping for automatic backups in a future enhancement. Only challenge I've found so far is recurring tasks. Seems if you mark complete from the notification it completes the parent task rather than the instance. Pretty sure that'll bite me sometime soon. Otherwise it looks pretty promising!",1
"I just started using Tasks to manage preparation for and recovery from heart surgery. I found it easy to use at a time when I couldn't afford a steep learning curve. If it synced with my Google tasks, I'd give it 5 stars. Addendum to review: I've been using the app for about 6 months, both for recurring tasks and one time tasks. Is there a plugin capability? I would be interested in writing a plugin that collects and stores info (JSON) when a task is marked as completed.",1
"would be nice if the app would open on a home screen of all active lists instead of opening in the last open list with a drop down, but other than that it is highly functional. Easy to set tasks and reminders and update them on the move, i love the ability to adjust settings of how completed tasks are handled (hide, keep in place, move to bottom)",1
"Really easy to use, very nice to have the 'list of lists' in the menu, and sub lists under the lists. Works with the way I think. I can swipe to move the screen to the next sub list, but it's a little too easy to accidentally swipe and delete a task instead...maybe I'll figure out a better technique to do this, since I just started swiping between lists.",1
"Stephen, I've got to remove a star. I've been hoping you will address the issue that recurring tasks, once marked completed, don't go onto the next iteration- instead, they stay marked as completed and don't repeat as needed. I'm missing out on reminders for my daughter's medication if I don't remember to go uncheck the box after marking as complete. I know you are working hard & I want to support you, but I may have to go back to using Samsung reminders (ugh) since they don't have this issue.",1
"As someone with ADHD and a high-pressure job, this app is honestly SO worth it. It's eliminated the need for my paper planners and is FAR superior to Google Keep. I have two main complaints right now: - The desktop app that syncs with the phone app is buggy and missing quite a few features. It is still in beta, so, the issues are largely forgivable. - The repeating tasks feature is incredible... but it does not appear to work for tasks that repeat more than once/day (e.g. every 8 hours).",1
"Reply to Developer: I'll just say, thanks for all you do!! I think my biggest complaint, and it's a very small one, is that the sublists feature is slightly confusing. I don't love that it creates a list that is adjacent to the original list and not beneath/inside of it. Maybe I just don't get how it should be used. I would also love multiple tiers for subtasks instead of just one. That's all I have for now. Thank you for the excellent (AD-FREE!) app!",1
"It is an awesome app for organizing your schedule! It is similar to Google Drive but with reminders and check. The only advice I will give is that I hope it can have unlimited small sub lists in sub lists rather than only 3 layers, especially when the events can be divided into very small categories. It will be even better if it is like organizing documents.",1
"The only reason I can't give this app 5 stars is because you have to go to the menu screen to choose the task list you're working from. I think if it had a home page with icons or even a home page with a list of the different task lists that you can choose between upon opening it would make life easier. I have one task list for packing for a trip, one for camping, one for long term projects, and one for weekend projects.",1
"QUITE nice, but maybe not quite as intuitive as it could be. Granted, I'm 75--and slower than I used to be. LOL But I also worked at Stanford University and Microsoft (doing database management, editing, and proofreading). But once you ""get there,"" it's quite a nice program. (The option of setting 120 different background colors, though, seems silly--and almost trivial. I mean, WHAT. IS. THE. POINT?!? LOL) Anyway, 4 stars from me. I'm sure it will be even more useful for me over time.",1
"Very good app. I'd like it more if I could reposition subtasks up and down within a list's tasks. Also, it would be more helpful if tasks had start and end dates rather than only due date. Finally, it would be useful to be able to cancel tasks instead of just complete them or delete them. A deleted task is as if it never happened. A completed task looks done, even though it was actually canceled.",1
"This is organized and easy to use. You can make the lists as detailed or simple as you want. Unfortunately, it's not very visually pleasing. There are no options for font style or color. You can choose one color per list, but it only borders on the top and left side which looks a bit awkward. If you are looking to make dry, plain lists this would be quite good.",1
"I have tried so many task tracking apps because all of them seem to be missing some critical feature, and this one is about as perfect as it gets! Love the lists and sublists, subtasks, notes, and flexible reminder repeat options (seriously, so many apps make this a paid subscription option). The only problem I have with it is the kind of odd way that it handles completing repeating tasks, and I'm hoping this is something that can be slightly altered to make this app perfect! There's two main problems: 1 - When you mark the task as complete, it stays marked as complete until the next time it goes off. You can ""un-complete"" it and it will appear as a pending task with the next time that it will go off, but this tends to have weird results sometimes. There is an option to ""track history of repeating tasks,"" which duplicates the task when it's marked completed so there's a copy that will repeat and a copy that will go into the task history, but the duplicated task is also marked complete--leading to the same problem as mentioned above. 2 - You can tell the app to either set a completed task to repeat the specified amount of time from when it was completed (option A), or from when it went off (option B). (e.g., if my task that repeats once a week was due at 12pm Friday, but I don't mark it complete until 11am Saturday, Option A will have it repeat the next Saturday, and Option B will have it repeat the next Friday.) It's nice to have this option, but it would be way better if we could set it on a task-by-task basis. For me personally, I have a medication I take every two weeks; sometimes I take it late, and ideally, I should take it again exactly two weeks from then, so I would prefer option A for this one. However, I also have a reminder to back up my PC every Sunday; if I complete this late, I would still prefer option B and be reminded on Sunday every time, because that's when I generally have time to do it. I can only pick one style or the other, so I have it set to option B and just manually alter the ones that need it. It works, but it would be nice to have the option to automate it! Thanks for a great app and sorry for the super long explanation!",1
"I've downloaded plenty of tasks apps but found I didn't really use them consistently and abandoned them after a while. I've been using this one consistently. It looks complicated like a lot of others, but it's really not and you can begin to use it w/o tutorials although they are actually available on YouTube. So far no ads. One caveat, the premium is recurring and I already have too many really expensive ones. I would pay for a one time purchase. Give this one a go!",1
"THE BEST To-Do List app I've found. I have memory issues, so this app is a life saver. It's got great functions, BUT there's one function that doesn't work. Recurring tasks can use hour based increments. This is the only app I've found that does this. However, since the app only checks to update recurring tasks once a day...this doesn't work. If possible, could you add an option for users to adjust how often the app updates recurring tasks? It would help me so much. Thanks! (Samsung Galaxy S7)",1
"Extremely helpful app!! Helps me be very organized. I used to make paper lists, but I would lose them. This allows me to keep my to do lists in one place and is very easy to add tasks. I would like to see a feature where you can populate it daily/weekly/monthly . (ex. Morning routine daily, Vacuum weekly, mail out the electric bill monthly)",1
Previously I used a note app for reminders. This is so much better. It keeps me focused on what I need to do. I like that notes can be added to each task and that they are visible on the task list and you don't have to open the that particular task to view them. I like the ease of adding new tasks and that they can be named. Bright color choices are nice for each task. I only have one wish and that is that we could swipe sideways to see the other task lists so I could see other days quickly.,1
"Useful, love the levels of task breakdown and category color separation. I wish there was a way to understand better what it is indicating needs attention when it places a number on the outside of the app icon. As well, navigating from one agenda item to another another. Otherwise, a good app with lots of options to help organize my life, business or personal.",1
"Very confusing. I just need to easily set up a reminder, not to have to make a list for everything. I also need accessibility features, such as text to speech. I set this for the reminder sound to go off, instead it just vibrated. Not quite sure how I like this setup. I use text to speech to make entities, I need it to read my reminders to me when they remind me. eta: Thank you Stephen, I've changed my rating due to your wonderful attention and considerateness to your customers. I'm disabled and these changes one day will be helpful. I will keep checking and still try to use it and  will also recommend it to friends more tech savvy than myself. Blessings.",1
"Want to give 5 stars but wanna test drive some more. I accidentally erased a couple of items by sliding to the right. It's efficient when u want to delete. Maybe a warning before executing? So far, it's the best I've used, and I have tried a bunch. Keep up the excellent work! *Update:* U can turn that feature off in Settings so forget about a warning!",1
"Just started using since my last app was amazing but is now dead. I don't like that when I complete a repetitive task from a filtered list that the screen switches to the sub list. I want the view to stay where it is. I love the colors in this app. I have seen some squirrelly behavior when hiding completed tasks on a filtered list and having tasks with subtasks disappear even when not completed. I turned on hide completed tasks, but shouldn't that be the same?",1
"I like it so far. Found this since Wunderlist is ending and I refuse to use the one they recommend. This seems to do everything Wunderlist did. I like the color options for lists and I've been happily surprised with this app. The only downfall is they don't offer list sharing and it looks like they're going to charge for that in the future. If they make that free, it will 5 stars all the way.",1
"I absolutely love this program. I have the widget on the home screen and every time I push the home button it brings me to the task list so I can see what needs to be done. I just wish the premium version wasn't so expensive, they should have an option to have a one time fee which give you access to Premium features. I do have an issue with reminders though, I think it's a bug. If I set a reminder and choose all day option, it does not give me the option to repeat the reminder",1
"Love the app. Having all lists and tasks in one app is great. No more need for seperate apps. Have one issue - when using or creating a grocery list I would like to see department categories such as meat, produce, etc., as well as alphabetically so when shopping you could sort by department. Makes it much easier to grocery shop when you have icons and departments to look at rather than drag and drop.",1
"When you hit the back tab instead of going to the main list, it exits the app completely. Learning the specific why to return to main list is a little bit of a learning curve. Also, wish I could share a to do list with other app user that lets me know when task was completed. This would make the app better to a family with a crazy schedule.",1
"I use this app several times a day. I'm retired, but I still have lots of different responsibilities. I have a grocery list, and as I buy each item, I hide the item. Then when I'm ready to go shopping again, I can bring the item up to the list again. And I'm constantly changing my priorities with ease. I Make use of the background colors for each chore. Morning shores is the lightest orange. Outdoor chores are green. Driving to errands are purple. That way, it's easy to regroup them.",1
"I have tried a lot of task management apps, but this one outperforms them all. The user interface is so logical, uncluttered, and visually pleasing. With the ability to create unlimited lists and sublists and populate them with simple items or detailed tasks that you can categorize with custom tags, it does a lot. It has many versatile settings, task filtering, and sorting capabilities. It has a nifty widget as well. There are step-by-step YouTube videos, and the developer is very responsive.",1
"I perused several of the internet's top rated to do apps, but found this one by accident (I hadn't seen it on any lists) and immediately loved using it! Super customizable in every way, let's you make subtasks and sublists and include as much information as you like. I think it might be the perfect to do list app! What a gem to find! If you like the dopamine rush of checking things off and you have more things to do than you can keep track of, Tasks is for you!",1
"Unbelievably powerful. Very useful for anyone with organizational challenges or distractability issues such as ADD, ADHD, etc. The app is highly customizable. There are truly useful integrations with phone's calendar, notifications, and messaging. The ability to share lists is a feature I've frequently used. When I consider the benefits and how often I use it, the subscription costs have been well worth it to me.",1
"Great app! Does just what I need: keeps track of things I need to do. What makes it even better is if I put grocery store as a task, I can do subtasks that are my shopping list and check things off as I go then check the whole task of Grocery Store off my list, so easy. Love the color changes for each task, urgent in red, less urgent in yellow. Makes those really important tasks easy to spot. Also, I can move them around on the list in order of importance or order I will do them in. So handy!",1
"I've looked everywhere for an app I can use to write my schedules on and have an interactive check list widget that ACTUALLY marks them off without taking you into the app--this is the one. It is a little confusing to explore compared to other apps, but the creator made easy-to-understand videos on YouTube to explain it and I got it after the third tutorial. My only wish is that they add a full notepad section on the app as well. 5 stars anyways üòÑ",1
"Really helpful app, it's really useful to have it on my home screen as I remember to check it.",1
"The easiest and best list making app, I've found. It is so easy to use, edit, and customize. I use it for groceries, to-do lists, gift lists, entertaining, holiday menus, projects, etc. Check items off, move, or delete. You can also create subcategories. Developer is very responsive to questions.",1
"Great App for staying organized at work. I downloaded this app to keep my work Tasks separate from the calendar on my phone, and so far it has been really helpful. The app is pleasing to the eye with customizable colors, and with just a click, I can see what is on the docket for the day ahead. Items can be easily reordered by tapping the drag handle on the right hand side of the task. Steve, the developer, is also very responsive and helpful!",1
"After testing many to-do list apps, my search is over. Tasks is the best by far! The free version has many wonderful aspects, and I found that upgrading to premium provides even better features to assist in keeping track of a busy lifestyle. With reminders, sub-lists, highlighting, priority flags, and the ability to add notes and file attachments to your tasks, you will easily be organized! Thanks for this great app and for the lifetime subscription option (no monthly fee - love ‚ù§Ô∏è this)!",1
"I really this app. Very sensible and open to various list styles and it doesn't lock a bunch of critical functionality behind ads or premium mode. If I could make a recommendation for something that could improve, I'd personally really enjoy if after you completed a full list you got a little celebration? Like some confetti and a cheer maybe? Just a thought, it could make it easier to remember to finish a list if it came with a little bit of positive reinforcement at the end.",1
"I switched from Microsoft To Do to Tasks and it has been a great step up in features. I would love to see the addition of being able to schedule tasks on the nth day of the month. For example, adding tasks to the first Tuesday or last Friday of a month. Also needing to set a time for an all day event to be recurring is a workflow that is odd.",1
"I had an issue with my phone not syncing to Tasks correctly after a reset, and I reached out to the dev. The response was prompt, polite, and also helpful - for me to not only realize that the problem wasn't with the app itself (but ended up helping me identify the cause of the issue that I reset it for, which was happening to other apps and previously unknown.) The cause was unrelated to this app, but because the dev responded accurately, and detailed, I was able to figure that out.",1
"I was using Microsoft ToDo. It started sending out notifications a few minutes after they were due, so I looked for an option. This app has a way better interface and is much prettier. Beyond that, I emailed Microsoft about the issue a couple of weeks ago as of this review. I have not heard back. This developer responded to questions I had within hours. Having a responsive developer is extremely important to me. I highly recommend you try this. Update - The more I use this, the more I love it.",1
"I had used To Do app from Microsoft, which I like how it integrates with Outlook, but several months ago it began causing my phone to freeze. Took me awhile to figure out the cause, and when I did I deleted To Do. This app is better in many ways, so I'm glad I changed. And so far no problems with freezing the phone. After giving it a try for a couple of months, I'll probably upgrade to premium, not because I need more features but to support its continued success üòä",1
"I actually love this app! Just a few tweaks here and there would make it perfect. Cause I tried other apps before this one and this is the one that's done most of what I need it to. I like how u can customize each list with ur color of preference. I like how there is a breakdown to each list and the widget is wow! To improve, I suggest: 1) a tutorial to teach 2) a highlighted notification on the notification bar 3) attachments for tasks 4) automatic deletion of sublists once tasks are completed.",1
"The app would be perfect if it had space for note writting. Can't find reliable apps that have both :( Response: Yes, I've seen notes available within each task but I meant something more like a notepad of some sorts, to save notes separately.",1
"Easy to use, love crossing tasks out as I've done them",1
"I've had this app for awhile and I like the way it looks and works etc though I have realized with reminders I have set for everyday they eventually stop giving me a reminder and that can frustrating. Otherwise it's done a good job and I like the options for notifications (alarm, vibrate, notification etc) I'd recommend it but not for everyday notifications",1
"Compared to the competition this is a very good todo app. It does the basics the best. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does not seem to have a way to sync with a desktop or web application.   One thing that doesn't work well in my day to day life, in any to-do app, is more customizable sorting. Either it's too manual, making the todo app more of an interruption, or the sorting doesn't predict my priorities well. The simplest solution would be to combine basic sorting (priority, due date, category, etc) with manual sorting somehow. One way would be to have items initially sorted by your selected method. Then allow the user to manually sort any item. When a new item is placed in a list  the new item would be placed in order according to the those items that have not been manually sorted. If all items in the list have already been manually sorted then there are two approaches I can think of. Either have new items automatically be placed at the top or bottom in those cases, or even better the app could have hidden values for this. e.g. an item due 2/16 that's manually moved ahead of an item due 2/12 would be considered having a ""due date"" of 2/11 for sorting.",1
"It needs more options. I have ADHD. I get distracted a lot and tend to jump from one task to the next,p while working on a task, leaving things half done. This app is helpful to keep me focused on each task until completed. Since these tasks repeat each day/week/month, it would be helpful to allow me to copy it to the next day/week/month when it's due. Otherwise it's worked out great at helping me work through my tasks. Thank you.",1
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete. I can't figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete. - I can't make my recurring items show up on the calendar. - I can't manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am. - View previous recurring tasks.,1
"It's the best replacement for Wunderlist I've managed to find that isn't trying to map out my entire life. I had a bit of user-error when using the widget, but once I figured that out I updated my review from 3 to 4 stars. The widget does look a little pixelated, but that may be my phone's fault. Once list sharing is possible this will be my main list-making app! Keep up the good work, and thank you for making such a simple yet pretty app! =)",1
"Almost perfect, the only thing I wish was different is I wish all my lists were available on a main screen & that they were clickable from there. I don't like that it stays on one list instead of a homescreen instead where all lists available at a quick glance instead of having to go & open the tab to see the lists. I'd use it a lot more that way.",1
Helpful app,1
"I've been using this app for about a year.  This makes it the only to-do list type app I've used for more than a month.  It's easy to create lists and sub-lists.  The only things I wish it had are a help feature and a way to move the app, and its data,  from my tablet to my phone.  (My tablet does NOT have cell capability.)  I need the help because many reviewers mention features I'm unaware of.  I want to move the app, and it's data, to my phone as I carry the phone with me more than the tablet.",1
"I've been using this app for a while now, and elected enough to pay for a year, but it took a while to figure it out. There are a lot of options, and not all of them are immediately obvious. Mostly, the confusion for me is hell to handle the recurring tasks and not have it marked as done permanently rather than just for one occurrence. I've got it all working now (I think), but it could have been easier and spelled out better in the help and documentation.",1
"My wife has gotten good use out of this app and really appreciates all the features that have gone into it. The only issue that has cropped up is a bug that forcibly opens the Google Play Store app whenever she tries to edit a task, blocking her from editing it. She's using an old phone, so maybe the app is just glitchy with the older version of Android, but that phone isn't on the network, so she's been thinking of switching to using a newer phone. Which, unfortunately, will be tedious.",1
"Still in the testing phase, but it's the best app I've tried so far, and it's really usable. I think the sublist feature will turn out to be really useful in the end by allowing me to break down tasks into subtasks and something like a grocery list into subitems for a particular dish.",1
"I'm an ADHD check-off-girl. I love checking things off on my lists of things to do - it's positive evidence of my productivity and it makes me feel like I'm making progress. Tasks does this for me. It's simple, only essential bells and whistles like calendars, and reminder alarms. It's also straightforward, easy to understand, and intuitive in it's use. I'd add a few more check off features, but it works great for me as is.",1
Love it. Super simple,1
"So far, so good. I can complete tasks easily without the need of scrap paper.",1
"So far, I am enjoying and making good use of this app. I wish that it could sync to my Google Tasks, and I'd like to be able to sort a little more granularly, such as by due date, then by priority. Aside from those two things, the app is well designed and logical with lots of customizeable features.",1
"The calendar is really cute. It is very aesthetically pleasing. I like that you can add stickers and link Google Calendar. There is a section to add Monthly, Weekly, and Daily Goals. As well as customized sections on the Daily view.",1
Very easy to use and a quick reference,1
Great app,1
"Love this planner! I can set events to repeat, or to roll over to the next day, move events with my touch screen, and make as many lists as I like! AA allows me to schedule items on my lists, and I can color code and use/resize digital stickers to my heart's content! Better than paper (no more re-writing the things I didn't complete: just move them digitally or automatically to another day!), allows me to choose a font - always better than my own handwriting! Try free fully-functional trial!!",1
I always seem to do better when I have my lists. But I have gotten so tired of little scraps of paper floating around or not being able to find the right page in a bullet journal. Artful agenda puts most of my lists in one place. I do still need my bullet journal for stuff like my budget and what not but everthing else crossed over and its so nice to have everthing right there rather then having to go searching for the right notebook. Love it and will keep using it.,1
"I have always loved planners! But after everything that did and (mostly) didn't happen in 2020, I had a wasted planner. It made me not want to buy one ever again. But this app had been the best agenda! The subscription options are good for my budget, and having everything on my phone is so much easier! Even if I don't have many plans, I have never felt like I'm wasting money on a planner anymore!",1
Love love love this app/site. I have been looking for YEARS for a digital calendar that also feels like a paper planner because I've realized that I just don't like carrying around a physical planner and I need the search feature of Google Calendar to look back on past tasks and events. And this calendar DOES IT ALL! The sticker feature is just the icing on the cake! So so so happy with my calendar. Well worth the cost!,1
"I absolutely LOVE this app! I always attempted to be a paper planner person because I love the creativity of it, but after a few weeks, I would either lose my planner or just stop using it. With AA, I am able to have it on all my devices and have it with me at all times without carrying around anything extra! I have started recommending it to everyone I know. And the price is great, I was paying that much for a paper planner anyway!",1
"I have been using paper planners for 40 years and I can't live without them. I have looked high and low for a digital paper planner and until Artful Agenda, there has not been one I have liked. I have purchased a few but I have to use another platform like ""Onenote"" and they have NOT been user-friendly which makes me use it less and I always go back to paper.üòû This is the best app for a paper-like planner. I can use my Spen with this app, add stickers, customize the covers, and so much more!",1
"Syncs with all my calendars. Beautiful design and ability to add my own personality with colors, covers and stickers. I would love more stickers or the ability to add them. The ability to use the stylus on my Surface tablet and Samsung Note Spen would make the whole experience complete. The developers are very receptive to ideas. Thanks!",1
"I am an austisic woman, who has grown up in a world full of technology. I need organization to make me feel safe and secure, but using physical objects like bullet journals just don't work for my life or school life. I have also tried other digital organization tools, but they just don't have that inviting and joyful feel that makes me actually use them. To get to the review, Artful Agenda has basically successfully fixed all of my problems! It is easy to learn, fun to use, and very helpful!",1
I saw this app as a recommendation on a Reddit thread for organization. I first tried it out as a desktop calendar and really enjoyed using it. The mobile app is a great compliment to the desktop program and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The fact that the two are synced has saved me from double booking myself on many occasions because I have the worst memory. I finally feel like a functional adult (in my early 30s no less!).,1
"So happy! I used to get the physical planners and stickers. Overtime I found it expensive buying the journal, stickers and pens, which becomes wasteful when i didn't like half the stickers or couldn't find what I needed. Also started losing interest with the binder and accessories being so combersome and still using my Google calendar to track appointments. This ap makes me so happy! It has all the creative and organized functions I've wanted and less than what I was spending!",1
"Love this virtual planner! Normally every year i would buy a paperback planner and would fall off after a few months because its just not practical to carry a paperback planner everywhere you go. However i DO carry my phone EVERYWHERE. The switch was a no brainer for me and artful agenda made it easy. I love being able to mark thing off when tasks are complete but also being able to veiw that they were there at one point. Big fan, 10/10 recommend.",1
"This is such a wonderful agenda. It's always with me (via phone or laptop) and I can customize to my needs..and amend it as required- WHENEVER required. It costs less than I'm used to spending each year and allows me the capability of more versatility, more creativity, and it has alerts which no paper agenda could EVER do. Thank you for your fun way to keep me organized! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"I love artful Agenda! As someone who is Type-A I have calendars, schedules, routines, and lists for everything and AA provides me the ability to keep it all in one place. I love the customizable features, and their customer service is top notch, always quick to respond. The best part, they listen to their users and do their best to add in features the users request. I recommend AA every where I go, to everyone.",1
"Love it! I was big on paper planners but I found it time consuming to have to basically copy my Google or work calendar into my planner and then having to do list that I couldn't access unless I had my planner with me (it's too large to carry around). I decided to try Artful Agenda and I love it! Easily able to update no matter where I am and I enjoy the to-do lists and lists, of course the cover as well. Worth the money to me.",1
"I ADORE this calendar! Did I need it...no. But it makes planning my busy schedule a little fun with the stickers and colors. Syncs easily with my many Google Calendars I love that there are different lists because we all have multiple lists lying around! I was always a paper planner person, but with running multiple businesses and not always being able to carry a planner in my purse/bag, I decided to give this a try. I hesitated for about a year before I realized I needed a digital planner. I'm so glad I purchased this! I love changing the planner cover and playing with fonts. Its just as great as a paper planner!",1
"I never leave app reviews, but this one is deserving--I absolutely love it! I can finally ditch my Happy Planner and save some paper! I never use the weekly spreads in my paper planner, just the monthly, and I make a ton of lists. And I never have time to sort through pages of cute stickers to jazz it up. This app has just what I need at a glance, it's easy to use, and it's so pretty! Plus, it's not anymore expensive than the cost of a 12-month paper planner.",1
"This planner is exactly what I needed. I love the customization. I use the 3rd task box for Notes instead. I like how List tasks can be scheduled and that checking them off in the calendar view will also check them off in the List. This is super useful for projects with multiple steps. So far, I have no complaints about this app other than syncing seems to be delayed between devices. If using just on one device, no issues.",1
"I've tried multiple paper planners (Happy Planners were my jam) and eplanners. This is by far the best I've used! After my two week trial I decided to wait and try out others but came back to this because it's so customizable! I have it on my phone, my work computer, my home computer and tablet and use it multiple times per day. I love the unlimited lists feature and pretty much everything about it.",1
"I am a die hard bullet journal fan and a long-time planner user. As my health coaching business has grown, I move appointments around all the time. Bullet Journaling was not efficient anymore. Still, I missed the pleasant layouts. I've been using Google Calendar with my family to keep up with everyone's appointments and school schedules. Enter Artful Agenda! Syncs with Google, has exactly what I need in daily task list complete with a box to check and everything! The layout is functional and pleasing to the eye. I couldn't be happier!",1
I am a full time working mom with 2 kids. Managing our household can be chaotic at times. I have been changing calender apps for years looking for the right one and I have finally found it. Artful Agenda is amazing and it's features help organize my life such as linking multiple calendars and color coding. It also help to make it my own with their sticker collections and covers. I highly recommend this app.,1
"I have always loved a paper planner look and feel but wouldn't use it because it wasn't easy to carry and I couldn't share it with my husband. This app was something I wished so much for but didn't know existed until recently. The functionality is amazing (syncing calendars), it looks amazing (stickers and customizable covers), it's reliable and easy to use.... you need this app! Plus it has an amazing community. Totally worth the yearly/monthly fee!!",1
"Love this digital planner! I was having a hard time keeping up with paper planner since having two toddlers! I have my phone with me most times, so this makes it easy to check my planner and to do lists since always on the go! The design is lovely and easy to go from monthly, weekly, daily, tasks, etc. It is exciting they actually listen to their users and try and integrate new things as soon as possible!",1
"This is the most convenient and amazing planner app! Seriously just get it, it's worth the subscription cost and I love all of the incredible possibilities that comes with having this digital planner. I have everything from my meal planning to keeping track of christmas gifts in my lists. I also love the syncability with email planners. The stickers and covers are so much fun! I just love it all.",1
"Amazing planner! I've been using the desktop version linked with my Google calendar and it was working great! Now with the app, it's even better than I thought it would be! I love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use! I especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks! It has helped me stay on task with work, cleaning, and everything else!",1
"I have been using this app doe about 6 months. Prior to using this app I was using Google calendar, which is a good calendar application, but I missed the functionality of a written calendar. All my notes, appointments, lists are in one app instead of multiple apps. It's been easy to use, have lots of theme choices, and I like the sticker options too. Overall, it's been really great at mimicking my hard copy calendars I used to use and its great because it's less bulky since it's on my phone.",1
"Great program for my needs. I use it in my cell, laptop, and Ipad, so it's handy to view or log at any time. It does what I need it to do, which is to show my schedule and my family's. It's nice to be able to make lists. I love the covers and stickers. I dont use the water tracker and wish I could remove and use the spot for something else, but very happy with it.",1
"This app is the best of both worlds! It is all the fun of a paper/binder calendar, but the convenience of digital use. Had no problem linking all necessary emails, color coding all family members, birthdays/holidays, it's all there! So easy to use, and get to have fun decorating with covers and stickers. Looking forward to some of the enhancements the AA team is working on. Very happy with my choice to switch to AA and have recommended to many friends already!",1
"I have tried every variation of paper and virtual calendars and agendas. Normally by the second week I abandon all of them. This app however has been a game changer. The fact that it syncs with my already existing calendars AND to my phone, my work computer, and my home computer is amazing!! I am still playing around on how to utilize the system to best fit my needs. Love how easy it is to make checklists and then actually be able to cross things off as you complete them. The only things I feel are missing for me personally is a way to cross off days in the month view, as I like to quickly glance at my calendar and if past days were even shaded that would be awesome. I am hoping in the future they potentially release some templates for the list pages as well that users could adapt to their needs as well.",1
"I've been using this app about a week now (still in free trial). I really wanted to use a paper planner (I like the layout, minimizing how often I'm on a screen...), but the reality was that after trying several planners, I never actually stuck with it because it's cumbersome to carry around. I decided to give this app a try. I love that the layout LOOKS like a paper planner, but it's portable because it's accessible on my phone! And it's super customizable! Loving it so far! üòä",1
"I cannot say enough good things about the Artful Agenda app. I have been using it for about 2 months now and they keep making improvements to the functionality and aesthetics! I am a diehard digital calendar person. This takes my planning up a notch with added features as well as making it ""pretty."" I have never spent this much on an app before, but the annual subscription is worth every penny to me!",1
"I love my Artful Agenda! Not only is it a great calendar, but it's a great place to keep the priorities on my to-do list, space for lists, and ideas, and even my daily goals & water intake. As a quad amputee, I can't use a physical planner, so I'm forced to go digital. But I love color, & graphics, & with the Artful Agenda, I'm not reduced to a boring black calendar. Thank you for giving me colorful options, & stickers to make my schedule more fun!",1
I really like how easy it is to add events and reminders for events. The customization aspect (which is a huge reason I don't utilize my phone calendar. I hate how boring it is). And then even the little lists for each page. Update: there was an app update that fixed the issues I was having with stickers loading and the app lagging. I've also found that I love how it syncs to my calendar so I can see my day at a glance from the edits I make in this app. Likely will stay subscribed for the year!,1
"I've been nothing but impressed with Artful Agenda. Is it perfect? No, not necessarily. But the amount of updates and new features that have come out in the short time that I have been using it, is amazing. The sync between GCal and AA is quick and easy. in addition to the app, it is also accessible on your desktop, which is where I spend my work days. Love that is all syncs across. The visualization of your calendar and events is flexible and allows for hex color values so you can use the precise colors you want. I really like the sticker sets and the vast majority are free. I've purchased a few additional packs. They are only $1-$2. Super well worth it. I absolutely recommend this app.",1
"I usually don't do digital planners, because there is something about writing something down that gets it into your brain, but this app and especially the desktop version makes it so satisfying to record events and to do lists and goals...it really has everything...that I may never go back to paper. You can customize what things you need and if you don't need something...change it.",1
"I like that I can access this calendar from my phone, tablet or computer. The one thing I don't like is that there is no place to write notes. There are 3 sections on the day view for lists. Can one be changed to a notes section? Thank you for the response!!! I went in followed your recommendation. It was easy & now I can add notes. Thanks!!",1
"This app is incredible! I am a HUGE calendar/organizational individual and this app is top notch! The features, design, and functionality is A+!! Easy to use, syncs with any email calendar as well as multiple email calendars. It is well worth the price for the app and being able to use it on your desktop. Goals, lists, hydration, stickers, meal prep..all in one! Genius idea and design. Very well thought out and applied. Well done ladies!üëèü•≥",1
"Beautiful!! I love this app!! I can sync all my calendars in one place, choose the colors for different calendars, and it looks and acts like a planner. I've tried a lot of digital planner apps, and this is the first one to actually do all the things I want. So over the moon about this app!!",1
"I love this app. It looks pretty and it keeps me organized. I only use the calendar, tasks and lists features of this app, so I am not sure I have tapped into it's full power. I do have it sync with my personal google calendar, that way I can see everything at once. Really so far it has been good and yeah I would recommend",1
"Overall, I like the app, especially the calendar color personalization and syncing. UPDATE: My concerns re: S-Pen were addressed with a suitable workaround using G-board. An issue regarding the widget was immediately corrected. The customer service is worth more than 5 stars! Looking forward to seeing continued updates and improvements.",1
"I'm in! Thank you Thank you Thank you! Only a week into the 2 week trial and I'm a fan! The checkmark feature alone is enough for me but the entire planner is such a streamlined experience. You've thought of almost everything. I do have a small wishlist for future features, but they will only enhance this product: -Full screen mode on website -Simple quick view for calender events instead opening to edit mode -Ability to use stickers in lists -Budget page option Thank you for this!",1
I love this digital planner. I usually prefer paper. But it's not convenient because I don't always have it with me. And I don't like the boring display of Google calendars. I love the fun customization you can have with this. The fun cover patterns and the stickers. I've been using this app for about 3 years and LOVE it!,1
"Edit: Support has remedied the situation already. While the app was not a fit for my needs, customer support is excellent. I signed up for a 7 day free trial today and was immediately charged full price. I canceled it immediately after. Hoping i receive a refund as I was supposed to have the option of canceling if the app did not meet my expectations, and it did not.",1
"Amazing app! I haven't been this excited about planners since I discovered HappyPlanner a few years ago. I love that there are digital stickers, and everything is so customizable. There are so many cool features, you can view the app on all devices, and you don't have to worry about figuring out where to store old physical planners. You can also reuse stickers over and over, unlike physical stickers where you have to buy new ones after you use them. Highly recommend.",1
"I've been a paper planner girl for years, and I don't say that casually. My planner is my vade mecum, my bible. Artful Agenda (Plus) is everything I've been looking for in a digital planner. It's cute, it has a great habit tracker, it's just structured enough, love the month/week/day option, and the lists option gives you lots of brainstorming room. My FAVORITE thing is setting up recurring tasks and having tasks roll over automatically if they aren't completed! It even has stickers!",1
"LOVE THIS!! It's cross platform so I can access it from my computer or phone! It has beautiful fonts, stickers & covers to choose from. The VERY BEST feature for me is that I can create notes in each section for monthly/weekly/daily. If I know something's coming up on a certain day, I can just go create a note under that future day to remind myself even if it's 6+ months away! I used to have to rely on tons of alarms all the time (adhd problems lol) but now I use this daily to keep me on track.",1
"Having a visually pleasing format that integrates with Google & behaves like a paper planner but available digitally is exactly what I needed to keep me organized. Being available as an app on my phone & tablet and accessible via the web (always synced), I never have an excuse of not having my planner handy. I like the ease of switching up the cover, colors & font themes to suit the month or season. I love the habit tracker & being able to upload my own stickers. Can we upload covers soon? üíúA|A",1
"I love this app for the most part; however find the most functionality in the desktop/browser experience. In the phone app weekly view, I have a hard time finding my priority tasks. All in all, I've been much better organized with AA than any other planning app/calendar!",1
"Everything is beautiful. I wanted to commit to the yearly payment of $34. But, it doesn't work fully offline. That's the only reason its a 4 star review. I don't like to be connected to WiFi if I can help it. But, if you are constantly connected, this app would very much be worth the price you payüíå",1
"I love the to rolling to do list feature, I hate rewiting my list, but also don't like a messy list. This feature is what sold me on getting the Calendar! I wish the sticker features had more holiday options and were easier to use for mobile.",1
I have only been using the app for a day and already I'm in love. There are 3 things I wish were different or could do... 1. To make the daily and/or weekly view of the planner a widget 2. To be able to adjust the notifications on an event so it's a preset everytime you add an event (like Google calendar does) 3. In the priority tasks to be able to set a time reminder... like 9am I'm reminded to do x. Regardless I still super excited to keep trying out my 2 weeks free and keep going.,1
"I never thought I would use a digital planner, much less love one. AA is the best planner I've ever used. It's easy to learn, great access on all my devices, no extra or hidden fees. AA a great organization system. Quick and easy access to calendars, notes, and connects with all my online calendars. It's a game changer for this busy employee/teacher/student!",1
"I tried to manage paper planners for years. I'd forget to update them, get annoyed when I had to scribble something out and change plans (just looked cluttered), and looked for a virtual ""paper planner."" I fell in love with Artful Agenda and will never be without it. I can color code events per family member, add stickers for special events, and even make To-Do lists, grocery lists, or track my water intake. Love it.",1
"I'm relatively new to the digital world of planning. I was tired of carrying around a big book and having pages I would never use but still had to pay for. I looked at several digital planners, and most were way more than I needed (fluff). I love that Artful Agenda can be as much or as little as you want. It is so customizable and ever evolving and so affordable. Thank you!",1
"Wish I had found this sooner! I have always been a die hard paper planner person. But it was awkward to drag around and so often, I didn't have it in front of me when I needed to. Artful agenda is amazing! I love that it looks like my paper planner with monthly, weekly, daily sheets, along with meal planning and tasks. Plus, I can have it open on my desktop to keep up with things and can also use my phone and my tablet so I am literally never without it. And it's user-friendly!!",1
"I love this app. I'm a chronic planner buyer, and they rarely live up to their potential. I love how customizable the layout is. I love that task lists are automatically given check boxes. I love the water tracker! Syncing all of my digital calendars in one place is so helpful. I have Artful Agenda open full-screen in a second desktop on my Mac and it's a revelation.",1
"I have tried so many types of planners, both paper and digital, from bullet journals to discbound types and all sorts of digital versions. This is my favorite by far. I love the look of my favorite paper planners (artistic elements, personalization options) with the functionality I need of digital one (alarms & reminders, portability). Artful Agenda really is the best of both worlds!",1
"I have finally found ""planner peace"" with Artful Agenda. I love paper planners and all that goes with them, but I never use them consistently. Being able to access AA at work and home in my browser and on my phone on the go has been a game-changer. It seems like they constantly rolling out new features as well. And the price is at least $20 cheaper than the last customized planner I invested in.",1
"As a bullet journal user I have been wanting a digital version that would sync with my personal electronic calendar and low and behold Artful Agenda! This is the best of both worlds. Able to be customizable and update as the mood strikes you. Places to take notes. A spot to log water intake, what more could you ask for. This is exactly what I needed. Anxiously awaiting the offline feature!",1
"Never thought I'd go digital for a planner. I was a diehard pencil to paper kind of gal. However, the thing was never with me when I needed it. I'm not carrying it around with me like I do my phone. I'm a home health speech therapist and when COVID hit, I needed to minimize the amount of things I brought into my patients' homes which started my search for the convenience of a digital planner with all the customization of a paper planner. It has absolutely everything I want: - month, week, and day views with hourly breakdown (week and day) - repeating tasks so I don't have to write the same thing over and over - unlimited notes/lists - syncs across devices. I have it on my phone and computer. Best of all, I have it on my work tablet. No more accidently double booking speech sessions! I'm also a hippie and don't think this gets enough love for it's ecofriendly features. - it's all digital = no trash going to landfill - easy color coding = no more multiple plastic pens or washi tape (less clutter in the office/supply bag) - no more physical stickers - multiple covers you can change anytime And it's just so stinking cute!",1
"I love this app. It's the only planner I've been able to keep up with. The list tab is a game changer for me in the digital planner world. The developers seem fairly responsive to feature requests. Being able to edit my calendars and check off tasks as well as the ability to edit the water tracker and add grids to the lists are the only ""complaints"" I would have, but they are minor issues with easy work-arounds for me.",1
It was great until it wasn't. It started having technical issues. I couldn't use the widget. It started to glitch and spasm. Had high hopes for this planner. I'm a little disappointed üòû . Update...I really like the app. They reach out to me and fix the bug. The app is working great!,1
"I've always needed lists, alarms, and reminders, so planners have been a must for me. The big problem is that my paper planner is not always with me, or readily available. I now decided to give Artful Agenda a try, and I'm loving it! I love that I still get to personalize it with stickers, different fonts, and all the colors. I love the integrated alarms. I love that it keeps me organized, and that it's always with me on the go! I'm loving this digital planner!",1
"I give 3 stars for now because it's still really glitchy. It's all lovely thus far, but with being an agenda it's a must to run smoothly. My time slots will not go where they are supposed to? I've tried trying my own glitch to see if it would work like setting completely different times and then setting back and tried manually moving the schedule to it's slot but it moves my other schedules around. I am very excited about this app, I've been on the hunt for one for ages. Please fix! Thank you!‚ù§",1
"Been using this app for about 6 months with a 1 year subscription. It really is the closest app to a real life paper planner. I especially love all the extra customizable sections to make monthly and weekly goals, meal plans, and to-do lists. The customizable fonts and covers are also colorful and modern looking. Tech support is also pretty responsive!",1
"I love this app! You can seemlessly synchronize unlimited Google/Outlook/Apple calendars across all my devices, with recurring events. You can customize with free fonts, covers & stickers, and purchase more if wanted (at a very reasonable cost). You can also add an unlimited number of lists to keep track of everything, and assign each item to specific days. There's so much more to love, and more amazing features are being added for added beauty and functionality.",1
"Game Changer! I switched from a paper planner because it was just too cumbersome, and I could never refer back to something I had written on it. With AA, I can search on a key word to find my notes. I use it across 3 platforms (Android phone, iPad and MS Outlook on a Windows laptop) and it synchronizes seamlessly. I also sync to 4 different calendars so that everything is in one place. The stickers are helpful on the month view to see what sort of activity is planned. Love it!",1
"I have always been a paper planner girl, but now that I've tried Artful Agenda I will never go back! I love the custom covers, adorable stickers and the ability to link multiple calendars together in one place! It's extremely functional and I am obsessed with the fact that I can access it straight from my phone (and computer, too!). No more anxiety about losing my paper planner...loving this beautiful, digital way to organize!",1
"I have so many positive words on this app. Originally downloaded on iOS (along with 10 other apps to see which one works best for me and my planning needs). This one, well, won. The interface, the stickers, the ability to snooze todos, and sync with multiple calendars. It's a dream. The only thing I wished was to have the ability to view it on my android. Lo and behold, there's an android version and it's perfect.",1
"The BEST bullet journal style planner! My favorite aspect is when I add an event to any of my calendars, it automatically syncs across platforms AND puts the event in the corresponding monthly, weekly, and daily views. If I don't accomplish a task on any given day, it's rolled over the next! Did I mention you can put this on your phone, desktop and/or access via a browser?! Totally recommend this app to EVERYONE!",1
"Overall, very helpful!",1
"This is the most comprehensive and user friendly digital planner I've tried. I no longer have to worry about transferring information, repetitive writing, or figuring out what I'm going to do with all of these beautiful paper planners I've used and can't throw away. It also costs a fraction of what I was paying for the 3 planners/notebooks it replaced. They're customer service is awesome! If you want functionality it doesn't provide, just request it!",1
"Omgosh! You HAVE to try this. I almost didn't do it because it wasn't free, but it's worth EVERY penny for me. It is super easy to use and figure out. I can easily see every appointment/event on the monthly view tab, which is hard to find. Notifications are great. The ""lists"" are unending, goodbye to my separate notes apps!! And some beautiful stickers to make seeing and remembering your event quick and at a glance. I can't say enough. Everything I have been looking for! Thank you!",1
Love this app. All my favorite parts of a paper planner with the benefits of my multiple online calendar management!,1
"I have used paper planners and when I tried this one, it clicked with me. It is easy to use it syncs up with all of my email accounts smoothly. I can look things up in a moment whether I'm on my phone on my tablet or my computer. I've had this for a year and a half now, and will keep it!",1
Great app!,1

Love the functionality and beauty of this app!,1
"Love this app! So many features all in one app. Lists, Habit tracker and day, week, Month views.",1
Best agenda app ever! I love paper planners but I need the digital reminders to pop up on my calendar. This is the best of both worlds!,1

I have been using Artful for a little over 2 years now. I find it so user friendly and intuitive that I have now also convinced two others to give it a try as well (who have stated they enjoy it). 10/10,1
I love this digital planner. I usually prefer paper. But it's not convenient because I don't always have it with me. And I don't like the boring display of Google calendars.

"I use it on my phone, tablet and pc. Love it!",1
Love it,1
Very cute and easy to use..,1
I absolutely love this planner!! It's everything I need; a digital planner with a physical paper feel. It's genius! And I love the addition of the Habit Tracker.,1
Great app! So helpful I can't tell you how many times a day I look at the widget.,1
"I have tried several digital planners but always went back to my paper ones because it was ""prettier"" with stickers and color coding. Loving Artful Agenda. Using it everyday, thinking about putting my 2024 paper planner away",1
I love this app! I love having everything in one place. It really helps me to be more efficient. And the stickers make it fun to personalize.,1
"Responsive, creative, supportive Facebook group.",1
"Edit: Support has remedied the situation already. While the app was not a fit for my needs, customer support is excellent.

Love my pretty planner! I go back and forth between the web version and the android app seamlessly and love it.,1
Love this app. My favorite feature is that my priority task rolls over to the next day when not completed.,1
"I never thought I would use a digital planner, much less love one. AA is the best planner I've ever used. It's easy to learn, great access on all my devices, no extra or hidden fees. AA a great organization system. Quick and easy access to calendars, notes, and connects with all my online calendars. It's a game changer for this busy employee/teacher/student!",1
"I was very skeptical that I'd like switching to a digital planner, having always been a planner book devotee, but I absolutely love Artful Agenda! I tried several different programs first that didn't suit me, were too complicated, etc, but I loved this one immediately.",1
Wish there was a subscription tracker intergration,1
Love this planner!,1
Love it!,1
Been using on apple and now just installed on an android phone. Love this journal more then any I've tried... And I've tried a lot.,1
beautiful calendar app. intuitive and easy to use,1
"Long time subscriber :D Subscribed for the year membership back in 2019 and I honestly can't imagine my life without it. It is aesthetically pleasing, practical and useful without being too overwhelming, and integrated well with other organizational platforms (Outlook calendar, Google calendar, etc.). While I am looking forward to the upcoming updates, I'm happy with this app.",1
Amazing!!,1
"I've had Artful Agenda for about 6 years now! I love this digital calendar! It's pretty, it's fun and it keeps me organized as a busy homeschool mom of six kids, an entrepreneur and minister of the gospel! It links to Google calendar as well, which is brilliant and there's many cool sticker features to jazz up your daily schedule. It's great on both app and desktop. Don't know what I'd do without my Artful Agenda!",1
"I've been a customer since nearly the beginning and I won't say it's perfect but I won't go back to paper planners ever again, even though I adore them. This app is simply the best of both worlds! They continue to upgrade the options and user experience. I love the customization I can do with it √†nd how it dovetails nicely with Google Calendar.",1
"Amazing app! Artful Agenda is the planner of your dreams. It's decorative and fun for every season or holiday, has so many great features, and truly helps keep you organized! I searched for quite some time for the perfect planner app, and I didn't have to look any further after finding Artful Agenda! I have used it now for 2 years and they continue to improve and update. Highly recommend!",1
"Love, Love, Love this!! I finally have a way to combine my need for digital convenience with my desire to still have a paper planner. The integration between my computer and my phone has saved my bacon more than once! As kind of a side note, the ability to change up the covers to suit my ADHD brain is fantastic! It is slightly more difficult to create appointments and make changes, but it's definitely not a deterrant at all. I give this 2 thumbs up!!",1
"As someone with ADHD, I use my phone calendar religiously to remember important things, but I also ALWAYS buy a paper calendar that I will only use for 2 weeks before I stop using it for the rest of the year. Instead of impulse buying a paper planner and trying to coordinate between both this one and that one, I use this. I LOVE this, the way it syncs and how you can customize it. I can't wait to see more customization options in the future. I can also change covers whenever I want! Bonus.",1
"I am a new user, discovering all of the features, really coming to like the product. For the cost of an annual paper calendar, the digital planner is really fantastic . I really like that the developers listen to what features we would like and make adjustments so the AA continues to grow with our needs. The support team is very responsive. The features are well thought out, and the calendar pages are visually beautiful. This is the most paper like, functioning virtual product I have found.",1
"I'm only about a week in and I LOVE Artful Agenda. For the past several years I have used a physical planner consistently, but of course still had to manage Outlook and Google calendars this is literally the best of both worlds. I have it up all day while I'm working, take notes into it, add to my task lists and assign them out to different days. It is everything I hoped it would be. I'm looking forward to discovering more features.",1
"Already Falling in Love with this app. I have been looking for a digital alternative to my planner but didn't want to lose the decorative function of my hardcopy and this one has stickers and is really visually pleasing. I am new to AA but I think it is going to be the one I use. I have found it to be easy to use and reliable, no crashing or freezing.",1
"I have purchased so many planners in my life and have bought all of the fancy pens, stencils and stickers. I always have great intentions of planning and being more organized but the planners always end up forgotten and unused in no time at all. I am only a couple days into my free trial of Artful Agenda and LOVE IT! I can customize it and make it look pretty but able to sink it to my gmail and thus have it on all of my devices. Now I never have to worry about leaving home without it.",1
"I have been a paper planner girl for a VERY long time. I am really enjoying Artful Agenda. I love being able to personalize pages along with integrating multiple calendars. I am still new to the app, and I look forward to learning more about it. Update 8/24/21 still loving the app over a boring old Google calendar. Keep up the good work, looking forward to more updates.",1
"Great planner app that is constantly evolving and getting better. It takes any calendar - google, outlook, etc, and makes it pretty, and fun so that you actually want to look it and use it. LOVE the lists and how they integrate as tasks to check off on days you assign that they're due. What's most impressive though is that the company is always listening to the users, fixing bugs, offering help so it can be used to it's full potential, and making improvements and updates based on our suggestions",1
"Love planners but hate to waste paper? Can't choose between daily or weekly layouts? Then this digital planner is for you! All your events and to-dos automatically move between the daily, weekly and month views. You can track meals, water intake and a custom field. It's also got a handy list section for taking notes and syncs with your existing virtual calendars. Best of all, it's accessible on the internet and as an app, so you'll never be without it. Plus, you can personalize the design.",1
"I've tried so many things- created my own systems, used planners, bullet journals, calenders, etc. This one combines the best of everything from all of the mentioned above tools. You can make to do lists, goals, put stickers, track your water/meals, and have a day/week/month overview (and you get a little inspirational quote in multiple areas). The look of the agenda is also gorgeous. I absolutely love this app, I have already recommended it to friends, and I'm excited to continue using it. :)",1
"LOVE this app!!!! I was having trouble managing my daily agenda, but Artful Agenda has really helped me to stay focused on tasks each day. It has tons of great features and the developers are extremely responsive to the customers. Artful Agenda is beautiful and so easy to use. You can sync all your calendars in one place, create limitless tasks and lists, schedule tasks and reminders, use daily, weekly, and monthly views, and make it fun with tons of covers and stickers. Very highly recommended!",1
"Love the background options and that it has a really well functioning widget. I wish it had the ability to have multiple widgets at a time (so I could have one for calendar and one for a to-do list). The to-do list is a wee bit clunky to enter items, but you get used to it. I wish there were different stickers available, or couldnintergeate/import other stickers. This is definitely the best ""digital"" bullet-journal I have come across.",1
This virtual planner app is great! I really like that it looks like a paper planner. And some might be wary because it's not free but I figured I usually end up spending 3-4 times more on paper planners and supplies throughout the year. The widgets on my phone have been easy to set up & use and there is good support if you have any issues or just questions on how to find or do something.,1
It has been a great experience coming from paper to digital. I like all the custom sessions and the things they are adding. That makes it feel like a paper journal.,1
"I am loving this app! I have it installed on my Android phone, iPad and PC. They all look and work the same. Sometimes Apple versions are a little different. They all sync together with not problems. I have all my weekly activities color-coded. I put in my one-time appointments with reminders. I have my to-do lists also that rollover undone tasks to the next day. It is easy to edit appointments and tasks. I emailed suggestions for stickers and received a response right away. Hopefully they can add them soon. Wonderful app that is fun and easy to use.",1
My planner journey has been evolving for over a decade. As I added a more fast paced role in my job and adding in 2 kids and their schedules to the mix I needed something that could move to digital. And while I've found amazing resources for lists and to do and separately for calendars I was having such a hard time finding something that sync'd all my existing calendars and had my to do list in with it. Artful Agenda brings it all together. Worth every penny (and less than I was spending on paper planners and notebooks to try and do the same thing).,1
"I love this digital planner. It is simple to use, nice to look at and gives me just enough to keep me on track each day. The best part is that it links to my Google calendar so I'm not inputting events in multiple places and it works across my devices. I love using it on my tablet, but appreciate having it at my fingertips, on my phone. Well done! I look forward to seeing other nice touches that you add over time.",1
"Artful Agenda is a wonderful electronic planner. I used to use a paper planner bc Google calendar just wasn't enough. AA fills the gap. Not only do you get day, week, and month views, there are areas you can customize with goals, to do lists, meals, or whatever you need to track. Also, stickers and interchangeable covers help make the planner your own!",1
"OMG, I'm in love!!! The personalization and ""pretty"" factor are the only things I love & miss about physical planners (they're worthless to me, with my ADHD), and this has that and more! I can combine my work Outlook & personal Google calendars easily, choose which calendars in each, set multiple alarms, see different views, put my lists and other notes for the day/week/month, set tasks to recurring (though I also use Asana so probably won't use this much), & so much more!! This is EVERYTHING.",1
"This has been the best planner to date with daily, weekly and monthly views of several calendars. I especially enjoy the ability to have list and be able to check off completed tasks as well as not be limited to the length of the list or the quantity of lists! Thanks for the great application! Ps ... will there be, in the near future, the ability to add pictures and tables to my lists? I'd love to be able to see before and after pictures of my renovation ideas and hobbies. Please and thanks!!",1
"This is the best solution for me. I have ADHD and while I love pretty planners, every time I buy one, I lose it within two months and stop using it. This digital solution uses my Google calendar where I already put my important things so I can get reminders and turns it into a planner that I can decorate with digital stickers and washi, change the cover, color coordinate etc. without having to worry about losing it. There are places for daily to dos and other lists. Seriously life changing!",1
"I have always been a paper calendar lover because I can use colored pens and stickers to enhance and create a memorable calendar. With this app it's better, brighter, cleaner and so much more. It goes with me everywhere without having to carry something extra. I can access through my phone or laptop and it can sync with multiple calendars keeping my work and personal appointments well organized. Thank you for creating the ultimate paper calendar in digital format.",1
"So I love this app- I think it's perfect for what I needed, at the time. Sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar/planner. Artful Agenda was still great but I found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it. I canceled my subscription- they were super easy to work with. I still recommend this app to girls when asked - ‚ù§‚ù§ I love and miss Artful agenda. When my job changes again I'll be back.",1
"I just got this app 2-3 days ago but I'm already OBSESSED. I've bought many paper planners, made my own planners with check boxes & daily schedules (I even saved one as a picture in my notes app so I could write on it digitally), & I've tried all sorts of planner/calendar apps. Let me tell you, this one has blown them all away. My favorite feature is being able to go into the lists tab & assign tasks to other lists. One request? A lists widget so I can check things off from my home screen.",1
"This seems amazing & everything I want! I like to plan out & schedule tasks I want to accomplish during a specific week without having to schedule it to any specific day that week. Like a weekly to-do list where I can drag and drop the weekly tasks I want to work on that day. This is the only app I could find that even has a weekly note section/to-do list!! Sadly, I cannot justify the price right now and will be sticking to my paper planner, but when I go digital, this will be my app of choice!",1
"Update: Had a rocky start but now im loving this planner. Still learning all the fun things it has like Stickers!!! Colorful themes, syncs with Google calendar. I use lists like crazy when i shop or need to know what to focus on for the week or day. Support always gets right back to me. Ive tried other planners and calendars this one by far requires less video watching.",1
"I live by my calendar and lists on a daily basis. I manage 5 schedules and Google calendar wasn't cutting it! I found artful agenda and absolutely *love* the way I can organize my calendar the way I want it to look and feel. The ability to add color, tasks, lists, meal planning, and sync everything together has proven this was a worthwhile purchase for me! I appreciate how the company listens to users and makes changes and enhancements based on the customers' needs! Highly reccomend!",1
"Instantly hooked! I have tried so many other digital planners, but this one is my favorite, even just after a couple days. Very user friendly, fun, syncs with my Google calendar and across platforms, and many of the sections are customizable. I don't like tracking meals, so I simply renamed the section to ""exercise"", and now the planner better suits my needs. I'm constantly finding new little features to love, and simply cannot fit them all here. I'm a bit of a planner nerd, and I love this!!",1
I have been waiting for forever for a customizable digital planner that does what this one does. The backgrounds are gorgeous & there's lots of variety. The features are EXACTLY what I was looking for in a digital planner. I love the daily sections & lists. I love that you can share calendars and sync to multiple different ones. I have only been using it for about a month & have already recommended it to friends & family!,1
"Artful Agenda is the most functional and versatile calendar/planner I have ever used. I used paper planners for many years, but I got tired of carrying them around, so a few years ago I transitioned to a digital calendar combined with a variety of ""to do"" apps and note taking apps. Artful Agenda integrates all of those functions into one neat and user-friendly package that can sync multiple calendars across multiple platforms and devices. It is well worth the modest annual subscription price.",1
"I've used artful agenda for almost a year now and I absolutely love it! It has made keeping my appointments and bills for the entire family easy to keep track of. I know I don't always take advantage of all of the features, I'm horrible at consistently meal planning, but I have this app synced over all of my electronics. It's like having a physical planner but I don't have to lug around another item, but I always have my phone on me. I just recommended this app to a good friend of mine. Sheüíì's!",1
"Beautiful!! I love this app!! I can sync all my calendars in one place, choose the colors for different calendars, and it looks and acts like a planner. I've tried a lot of digital planner apps, and this is the first one to actually do all the things I want. So over the moon about this app!!",1
Good,1
"I really enjoyed the trial. I love the look and ease of use on the desktop verson. Just getting used to the mobile version. I hope I can print this out and add to my discbound organizer too.. I'm new to using planners. It can be a little glitchy but, I enjoyed using it.",1
I am enjoying this app and love many things about it. The only thing I would add is to be able to write in the daily tab without adding a whole event so I can just jot down my timeline of more minuet things.,1
I really do love the app. I just wish we could do a few more things. Maybe let us add our own tabs.,1
Love this and it gives me enough to almost go completely paperless. I just need an integrated habit tracker and would LOVE a stylus option as well.,1
"At first I was overwhelmed with everything and how to do it, but my friend helped me, and I'm glad she did. I love this calander.",1
The app has been super easy to use and is very pretty. It's a step up from Google Calendar in terms of features and I'm looking forward to seeing what else they do with it.,1
"Sweet little digital planner ... I love the stickers, cover selections and sync between mobile and desktop versions. My only disappointment is limited Widgets options for android users",1
Good just need financial planner page please.,1
"Wonderful Digi Calendar. I love the optional layouts. Yes, there is a fee, with it wasn't but oh well. Ive had other calendars and they weren't as nice.",1
"I am only a few weeks into using AA, but I am feeling very positive. It feels simple to learn for a ""new to app planners"" user. The support through the FB page is prompt and helpful and supportive.",1
"I have not been using this app long enough to give it 5 stars, but so far I am REALLY LIKING IT. I appreciate the simplicity. It's not overwhelming or overly technical which I love. I'll add more to my review as I continue using the app to organize my personal and work life. Thank you.",1
Great visual calendar. Great Lists function. An improvement I would like to see is the ability to use the stickers on the lists.,1
Calendar options & syncing is great. I wish there were better list options - like a daily to-do that would attach to the Calendar date.,1
"I'm still new to the app, but so far I'm happy! I love digital planning, but miss the beauty found in paper planners. This app marries digital and beauty wonderfully!",1
"It would be fantastic if this was compatible with ""Hey Google"" I can open the app by saying hey Google open artful agenda but it doesn't do anything else. I was trying to add an item to a list",1
"I wish there was a dark feature, the option for events to be highlighted with their specific color not the font, and much smaller text on the widget.",1
So far I love the layout and being able to have monthly/ Weekly goals. The stickers are pretty plain but the ease of using this app outweigh the stickers.,1
"I do not spend time writing reviews however, I love using my artful aganda it what I needed in my life and it has MOST of the features that I need in my day-to-day life. I am writing this view in hopes to bring awareness and bring attached too their daily quotes. It would be wonderful to read from people of color, LGBTQIA2S+ and our disability community during each celebrated months. Representation matters.",1
No Pen Support. I liked this app... the ease of use for the calendar is great. I didn't realize that there is no pen support. Canceled my trial. May check it out again later.,1
"Best calendar app I've used! Constantly improving & adding features. Still missing a few important ones (make lists private/only for 1 user & not others, repeat/rollover tasks is awesome but sometimes does not work correctly, edit a task in Artfully if pulled through from another calendar, etc.). At times a bit clunky, but overall it's extremely helpful & incredibly beautiful! Its fun stickers and gorgeous backgrounds always make me smile, too! (Thanks for all your hard work, Artfully team!)",1
Love that you can change the cover,1
"Very pretty and girly. I am still not sure if the price is worth it. I still use the Google calendar sometimes, and I don't miss this one, but for sure, there are more ways to keep my days and activities organized in a VERY CUTE WAY. I like it very much!!",1
"This app brings together everything I wanted in an agenda. I can easily track my goals & to do list as well as see my calendar. The website is better than the app. I have to clear the app from my recent apps in order for it to respond when I try to mark a task as complete. Customer service solved this problem. I also don't love getting notifications from this app for calendar events, and so still in put data in Google Calendar, but it syncs perfectly with this app. The cost is appropriate.",1
"At first I was overwhelmed with everything and how to do it, but my friend helped me, and I'm glad she did. I love this calander.",1
I love the app! It's great and syncs well with my other calendars. The only thing I wish they had was to choose different weekly and daily layouts. It's the best planner I have used and always end up abandoning my paper planners. Haven't done that with this one!,1
"Being a full time employee, full time grad student, and a mom, my schedule is crazy. This planner has been a game changer for me. I can color coordinate and use it on multiple devices! It's great! I just wish it more security. So like a bank app or something you need a pin or fingerprint to access it.",1
Wish I could make notes on days on calender itself without adding an event. I recommend this app just for the list feature alone. Use it daily.,1
"Thus far, enjoying the app, cross-device use, connectivity, and ease in adding the multiple personal and business accounts I monitor. One product suggestion which was submitted to tech support, have Samsung Galaxy Tab 6Lite and the pen to text does not work. Will this be a future feature.",1
I love how it syncs with Google for my husband. I'm using the meal planner and grocery lists which I enjoy as well. I'm still waiting and hoping for additional tracking like fitness and budget. Why artful agenda are you now charging an upgrade fee for those of us that committed and have stuck with you? This is super disappointing. As my original review shows I was asking for these things. When you said it was coming I purchased. Now I have to pay again not right not right at all!,1
"The calendar is really cute. It is very aesthetically pleasing. I like that you can add stickers and link Google Calendar. There is a section to add Monthly, Weekly, and Daily Goals. As well as customized sections on the Daily view.",1
"I am very new...about a week! I love that i can see AP on all devices (even an OLD ipad!). It is taking me along time to get it set up, to figure out how i want to use it. I am SO greatful for this app!!! i have spent too much money buying other digital planner apps that i was unable to figure out how to use. I am so happy with Artful Agenda Plus! i looks like something accomplished! the Admins are super friendly, the communnity is very friendly and cheerful!!! I am quite happy i bought this",1
This is a great app I just wish they would offer a monthly subscription also,1
Love this app .I would have given it 5 stars if it had a option to pay monthly instead of just yearly.,1
"I love the idea of this app. This is exactly the kind of planner app that I would like. I love the concept of a paper planner format with google calendar integration. However, there are still too many bugs to be functional. And there is not pen support that would make this perfect with my Samsung tablet.",1
"Very good calendar/planner. I love paper planners and this has come the closest to replicating that feel with the functionality and portability of a digital planner. Syncs quickly and easily with Google Calendars, which we use so keep track of home vs. work vs. extra schedules, activities, meeting, etc. I would like to see the ability to change the time for an event notification as well as more comprehensive customability for recurring events.",1
Good just need financial planner page please.,1
This is a great app I just wish they would offer a monthly subscription also,1
Wonderful app all around. I'm seriously enjoying it but here's my thing I wish there was a mood trackers option I've got serious mental health problems and being able to keep track of all the things I need to do and me mood all in one place would be great. It's just an idea that I think would help the app more ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"Very pretty and girly. I am still not sure if the price is worth it. I still use the Google calendar sometimes, and I don't miss this one, but for sure, there are more ways to keep my days and activities organized in a VERY CUTE WAY. I like it very much!!",1
"I really enjoyed the trial. I love the look and ease of use on the desktop verson. Just getting used to the mobile version. I hope I can print this out and add to my discbound organizer too.. I'm new to using planners. It can be a little glitchy but, I enjoyed using it.",1
"GREAT APP! Syncs with google calendar that is shared with family which helps keep everyone connected but this app gives me extra features that I need such as to do list, meal planning, and others. The one feature I would like that would give it the full 5 stars for me is the ability to showcase this on a device to hang on the wall. Hoping it will be a feature that is added someday!!",1
"I love this app! It makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty. It allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake, your to do lists, grocery lists, events, whatever you have in mind! I find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity. I only wish there were a widget available!",1
Creative calendar. I like the customization. I wish I could share events I make with other people like I can in my Google calendar. I have issues setting up a reoccurring every other weekend appointment and it keeps moving the time. Stickers are fun. Wish I could color the days in the month or week view,1
"Great so far. I recommend having the lists saved offline since I went to the grocery store & there was no signal so my list didn't load. That was inconvenient. I use it for priority tasks for the day, meal plans and different colors & stickers.",1
Best digital planner I've discovered so far! Its apparent simplicity belies its power and functionality. The lists feature is great especially the ease of transferring checklist tasks to a date. I hope it continues to improve and add new features.,1
"I do not spend time writing reviews however, I love using my artful aganda it what I needed in my life and it has MOST of the features that I need in my day-to-day life. I am writing this view in hopes to bring awareness and bring attached too their daily quotes. It would be wonderful to read from people of color, LGBTQIA2S+ and our disability community during each celebrated months. Representation matters.",1
Wish I could make notes on days on calender itself without adding an event. I recommend this app just for the list feature alone. Use it daily.,1
"Beautiful design and feels much like using a paper planner in terms of customisation. There are some nice-to-have functionality features on the way that I think will really enhance my personal experience with the app, but I already love what I've got and it makes staying organised feel easy and fun.",1
Love this app .I would have given it 5 stars if it had a option to pay monthly instead of just yearly.,1
"As a Mum and teacher I do love it and its the closest thing I've found to date to a 'do it all' filofax alternative, but it would be great if the stickers stayed in place between devices (can shuffle/fall out of ratio from phone to desktop) and if I was using it a little more...instinctively. That will come with time I think. Geared up for the Northen Hemisphere with seasonal sticker pack releases but that's not such a big deal.",1
"Gorgeous app! I love most of it - though there are a few areas that still need a bit of tweaking, and app development. - Like the fact that you cannot set a timezone to the full app, but have to edit every single time you input an event - and then the alarms go off in the wrong time zone. - you cannot sync more than 1 Google calendar, and it is quite a bother to try to un-sync if you use the wrong one. - cannot add stickers to notes. Love the customisation though!",1
"Pros: visually appealing, easy enough to understand and use, very similar to no frills yet aesthetic paper planning/journaling Cons: sometimes freezes/lags while inputing data, not as customizable as other digital planning apps (can only make to-do lists, no habit tracker, can't list items using other bullets such as ""reminder"", etc.)",1
"Plz ???‚ù§1.Widget that shows the current date, list of upcoming events, 1 click option to open calendar 2.Ability to set reminders/alerts for scheduled events 3. Ability to sync to phone's stock calendar (Android) 4.Additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5. Ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6.Ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high, low or routine along with the option",1
"I love the to rolling to do list feature, I hate rewiting my list, but also don't like a messy list. This feature is what sold me on getting the Calendar! I wish the sticker features had more holiday options and were easier to use for mobile.",1
"So far, I love it! I just finished my trial, and I'm still going strong. It's exactly what I needed/wanted. I wanted a cute paper planner, but I have so many appointments in my google calendar. It is definitely living up to my expectations. Rated 4 stars because you definitely need to play around with everything in order to figure things out. I have no doubt that that will not be an issue in a week or so.",1
I really really like it. Simple to use and it seems to be syncing ok. Love the colors and how it looks in my windows 10 browser. Look forward to updates like new stickers in the future.,1
"I think this is a great start to a product. I would love to see more features. Specifically features that let you link between lists and the planner sections, features that let you have subordinate lists, save information from a website or even be able to create a task or a goal directly from your email or a website.",1
"Not quite on par with Outlook, but it's getting there. When I use the application on my phone, are you often have to scroll to get to see where I'm typing instead of that being the automatic view.",1
"This is a great app, love that you can add stickers and keep everything in one planner, schedule, cleaning, meals..the only thing I'm hoping will get added is a habit tracker, that's the only thing that keeps me from %100 loving this app",1
I love this app. I can use it ony phone and computer. It syncs with a Google Calendar too. I wish I had more options of stickers. But it was exactly what I've been looking for.,1
"Overall good app with lots of colors. However, when creating a new event and save it, it moves it down by several hours and I have to move it back up where it belongs",1
No Pen Support. I liked this app... the ease of use for the calendar is great. I didn't realize that there is no pen support. Canceled my trial. May check it out again later.,1
"So far, I am enjoying artful agenda. I struggle with digital things because I'm just more paper type. The artful agenda had been recommended to me, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It's given me everything I need so far. I hope for more holidays covers. I love decorating my planners by the holiday of that month.",1
"Love the app ... was able to download it to my iPhone. I went to download it to my Samsung tablet. BUT once I hit open, all I get is black screen. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still won't work",1
frustrating that It must be used in tandem with other calender apps. I have this on my tablet but get reminders on my Phone because it is linked to my google account/calender. Cant seem to find a way to turn this off without going into my google calender and changing each individual entry reminder.,1
"I am still in my trial period, but I love the app so far! I had multiple calendars and it's great to be able to sync them all together with the option to color coordinate tasks based on each different calendar.",1
I was hesitant to try using an electronic calendar but after the trial I was hooked. I love Artful Agenda! It is easy to use and I love the stickers. The only thing that I would like to see is the quotes on the Android version (phone) and an app for the Kindle. Other than that I love it!,1
"This app is the perfect blend of paper and digital planner. I feel more organized with my schedule and what is going on throughout the month. I do wish there was an option for habit tracking, then it would be a 5 ‚≠ê from me.",1
I love using the stickers on weekly and monthly views. This ticks almost all my boxes for an organizer and is definitely better than paper. I wish there were more built in habit trackers.,1
"Everything is beautiful. I wanted to commit to the yearly payment of $34. But, it doesn't work fully offline. That's the only reason its a 4 star review. I don't like to be connected to WiFi if I can help it. But, if you are constantly connected, this app would very much be worth the price you payüíå",1
I need to pay for the app? How so so happy after looking after add and the video in this but I thought it was free but it was it that is your big big disappointment so sorry I can only give you 4 starts and i did not even get to try it ?,1
Really enjoying this app! Would be extremely helpful with a widget that shows my priority tasks.,1
"Love this so far, especially integration with Google calendar",1
"So far, I am enjoying artful agenda. I struggle with digital things because I'm just more paper type. The artful agenda had been recommended to me, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It's given me everything I need so far. I hope for more holidays covers. I love decorating my planners by the holiday of that month.",1
Simple to use. Also love the look of it and the stickers,1
Creative calendar. I like the customization. I wish I could share events I make with other people like I can in my Google calendar. I have issues setting up a reoccurring every other weekend appointment and it keeps moving the time. Stickers are fun. Wish I could color the days in the month or week view,1
Syncs to google calendar. Easy to use interface.,1
"I love using Artful Agenda to manage multiple calendars. The covers and stickers make it fun and replace some of what I loved about paper planners. The only thing that I would really love added is to be able to do time blocking in the daily view. Kind of like the lists, but straight on my daily calendar view without adding it to my shared calendar for others to see.",1
"This app is the perfect blend of paper and digital planner. I feel more organized with my schedule and what is going on throughout the month. I do wish there was an option for habit tracking, then it would be a 5 ‚≠ê from me.",1
"I really enjoy this app. I am a big fan of planners, lists and journaling. This app allows me to do that without having to carry around multiple planning materials. 4 stars because there is a a bit of a learning curve but overall I do love it. Things that would make it better: - ability to use stylus to 'handwrite' notes and lists, not just type. - Information put into AA automatically transfers to Google Calendar as well, not just Google to AA.",1
So far I love the layout and being able to have monthly/ Weekly goals. The stickers are pretty plain but the ease of using this app outweigh the stickers.,1
"Almost perfect! It's everything is want, exactly like the paper ones I used to carry around everywhere until that wasn't feasible. The only thing I still want is....push notifications for tasks, not just events, so I can be reminded to do them by a certain time! I know I could make an event but sometimes I'm not sure what time I can fit something in, but want to be reminded to have done before end of day without having to constantly open the app to see if I forgot a task.",1
I love the app and features just prefer an app that is free to useüòÄ,1
Only thing wrong is you have to pay in app. Also that the time zone changes and you have to manually fix or change them.,1
"I love it! I was hesitant at first to get a membership but is so worth it. It helps keep track of school, work, projects, and all. Is been a great way for me to establish a routine. But I just love this app so much. The designs are beautiful as well. However, I would love to be able to use my stylus and write with my own handwriting as well :) Also having the opportunity to write notes/text on some of the stickers will be amazing as well!",1
I love this app. I can use it ony phone and computer. It syncs with a Google Calendar too. I wish I had more options of stickers. But it was exactly what I've been looking for.,1
"I really love this app. It integrates well with all of the programs I use, the organizational and customization options are great, and it's just cute. The only ding I would give it is the stickers aren't visible on the widget. I use stickers to mark recurring events without taking up a bunch of space or to make them jump out at me. It's not a deal breaker since I can just tap to open the app, but it would be nice to have.",1
Love the app!,1
Sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. haven't used yet. But judging from the video the creator made I think she put a lot of time and effort into it.,1
"Pros: visually appealing, easy enough to understand and use, very similar to no frills yet aesthetic paper planning/journaling Cons: sometimes freezes/lags while inputing data, not as customizable as other digital planning apps (can only make to-do lists, no habit tracker, can't list items using other bullets such as ""reminder"", etc.)",1
"Great digital planner! I wanted a combination of something that would sync with google calendar but still allow for cute customization and this is it! There is definitely a learning curve when switching from a paper planner, but the more I use it the more I like it! There are still some features that are waiting to be developed, but it keeps getting better and better!",1
Love the features and functionality but it no longer syncs to my Google calendar and the widget has stopped working.,1
"Overall I really really LOVE this digital planner. I do see room for opportunities but that's with anything. Things that would make it 5 stars would be: 1. Putting tasks on the daily view and allowing task reminders, alot of people miss tasks because you specifically have to look to remember to do it. 2. Having a budget add-on where you can manage income and expenses in the app on a daily/monthly basis. 3. Being able to show the calendar in a widget form for your phone/tablet.",1
"I'm still new to the app, but so far I'm happy! I love digital planning, but miss the beauty found in paper planners. This app marries digital and beauty wonderfully!",1
The app has been super easy to use and is very pretty. It's a step up from Google Calendar in terms of features and I'm looking forward to seeing what else they do with it.,1
"I attempted to use the Artful Agenda a year ago but due to a technical difficulty, I wasn't able to use it. Fast forward a year and I decided to try it again. Why? The customer service is awesome! The developers were super helpful a year ago and that hasn't changed. With my second attempt I can already see improvements that have been made and am excited to see more features. Love the versatility! I also prefer a paper planner but I'm loving the customization this planner offers.",1
"Beautiful design and feels much like using a paper planner in terms of customisation. There are some nice-to-have functionality features on the way that I think will really enhance my personal experience with the app, but I already love what I've got and it makes staying organised feel easy and fun.",1
I love all the features about this app. I have been a hard copy planner and digital calendar user up until now. My biggest complaint is the drawing feature on the ipad (which is the main thing that makes me a convert) is very buggy and the app crashes very often on the ipad. The drawing feature sometimes deletes randomly or moves things drawn to odd places. If those issues were fixed it would get 5 stars. Love the sticker feature. Would love a check mark sticker. Wish stickers could be resized.,1
"I use Artful Agenda solely on my Android. Works well and I prefer it to Google calendar, but I'm sure it would be a lot more awesome on a tablet or computer. Basic but fun!",1
Wonderful app!,1
"It's grown on me. I've always been a paper planner user but this allows me to force my husband to look at the family calendar since he only uses foofle calendar. I have the flexibility for color coding, can change covers when I want, and it's always with me. I appreciate the consistent updates and I reactions with users to improve the experience.",1
"I love that I can sync multiple calendars, color code, and access this across multiple devices.",1
"Not quite on par with Outlook, but it's getting there. When I use the application on my phone, are you often have to scroll to get to see where I'm typing instead of that being the automatic view.",1
"I honestly love so much about this planner. It combines the cuteness of happy planner with the functionality of Google calendar and keep, plus more. I have a couple of small gripes, but overall, I love it. I accidentally paid $35 for the full version after the trial and while it was totally unintentional, I absolutely do not regret it.",1
I love using the stickers on weekly and monthly views. This ticks almost all my boxes for an organizer and is definitely better than paper. I wish there were more built in habit trackers.,1
I've used Artful Agenda off and on for 2+ years. I tend to jump from one thing to the next. There are some things that are lacking here that I think would make this a 5 star experience but Artful Agenda has amazing customer service and they are constantly developing and trying to give customers the things they ask for. I'm back and giving it another try with some of the new stuff they have added. Thanks AA!,1
Love this app. Especially the meal planner and thr ability to sync multiple calendars,1
Wish notes could be date specific w/ reminders.,1
Really nice app. Can't wait for more decor.,1
"I had purchased a different digital planner and after all of the major uploading it on my phone, laptop, then purchasing a tablet just for it, it was NOT user friendly. I attempted to use it on each of those devices and y'all ‚ùå that mess like to have drove me crazy. I stumbled upon Artful Agenda app üôåüèº. First of all you get a free trial period, 2ndly, it is user friendly, I am still learning different things. I really just enjoy it! Easy upload. Looking forward to all the new things to come!",1
"As a Mum and teacher I do love it and its the closest thing I've found to date to a 'do it all' filofax alternative, but it would be great if the stickers stayed in place between devices (can shuffle/fall out of ratio from phone to desktop) and if I was using it a little more...instinctively. That will come with time I think. Geared up for the Northen Hemisphere with seasonal sticker pack releases but that's not such a big deal.",1
App reminds me of the old Franklin Planner,1
"I am still in my free trial but so far i am loving this app! It has been very difficult for me to transition from a paper planner, but this just might be the key!",1
"I'm still in the trial period, but so far liking it. For some reason it won't let me put birthdays in it and set them to repeat yearly. I'm hoping this is because I'm in the trial period.",1
Wonderful app all around. I'm seriously enjoying it but here's my thing I wish there was a mood trackers option I've got serious mental health problems and being able to keep track of all the things I need to do and me mood all in one place would be great. It's just an idea that I think would help the app more ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
this is by far the best digital agenda,1
Best digital planner I've discovered so far! Its apparent simplicity belies its power and functionality. The lists feature is great especially the ease of transferring checklist tasks to a date. I hope it continues to improve and add new features.,1
love it! Despite the wonky glitches,1
It's nice but not what I'm looking for.,1
"So far, I love it! I just finished my trial, and I'm still going strong. It's exactly what I needed/wanted. I wanted a cute paper planner, but I have so many appointments in my google calendar. It is definitely living up to my expectations. Rated 4 stars because you definitely need to play around with everything in order to figure things out. I have no doubt that that will not be an issue in a week or so.",1
"I am only a few weeks into using AA, but I am feeling very positive. It feels simple to learn for a ""new to app planners"" user. The support through the FB page is prompt and helpful and supportive.",1
"Wonderful Digi Calendar. I love the optional layouts. Yes, there is a fee, with it wasn't but oh well. Ive had other calendars and they weren't as nice.",1
this has been a useful calendar for me. it syncs with my phone which is helpful. worth the cost.,1
"I love it because of the visual appeal of the app, and it's great that it syncs with your Google account. However, lately, I've been noticing that it takes a while for it to load up the app, and so I have to restart my phone. That can be annoying when having to write down appointments and other events on the spot. Other than that, this is a really good app that looks nice and keeps you on track with events, whether it is a one day overview, weekly overview, or monthly overview.",1
"Beautiful planner. I'm a paper and pen person, but this is really close. I love that fact it's cross platform. I currently have it on Ipad, android phone and pc it's fantastic. The stickers and colors are fun. I'm still learning all the features. I definitely recommend it.",1
"I wish there was a dark feature, the option for events to be highlighted with their specific color not the font, and much smaller text on the widget.",1
"I love this, especially being able to put things on my task list on the computer and then check my phone! The only thing keeping it from being 5/5stars is that there is no widget that allows me to see my tasks on my home screen. There is an agenda widget and a monthly widget, which are helpful, but I frequently forget to check my daily tasks when I'm not at my computer, like on weekends/school breaks(I'm a teacher, and honestly this app/site has helped a lot but I need a task widget for phone!)",1
It is cute & helpful. Dark mode pretty plzzzzzz!!!,1
"GREAT APP! Syncs with google calendar that is shared with family which helps keep everyone connected but this app gives me extra features that I need such as to do list, meal planning, and others. The one feature I would like that would give it the full 5 stars for me is the ability to showcase this on a device to hang on the wall. Hoping it will be a feature that is added someday!!",1
I love how customizable it is while still being really simple and easy to use.,1
"This really IS the calendar app I've been looking for! Add integration with a more robust todo app like Todoist or Google Tasks or Trello, and it would be absolutely perfect. Or at least a way to import tasks from one of those apps, that way I could really track everything in Artful Agenda. Love, love, love this app and the way it blends the experience of a gorgeous paper planner with a digital planner. Thank you!!",1
"I have not been using this app long enough to give it 5 stars, but so far I am REALLY LIKING IT. I appreciate the simplicity. It's not overwhelming or overly technical which I love. I'll add more to my review as I continue using the app to organize my personal and work life. Thank you.",1
Id love it if we could choose a custom default color when events are made.,1
Calendar options & syncing is great. I wish there were better list options - like a daily to-do that would attach to the Calendar date.,1
"So far, I am loving this app. It is very easy to use, and I always have my phone with me, so now I always have my planner with me.",1
Totally worth $35/year. Can't wait to see what feature gets added next!,1
"Sweet little digital planner ... I love the stickers, cover selections and sync between mobile and desktop versions. My only disappointment is limited Widgets options for android users",1
"I'm relatively new and enjoy using the app so far! It's easy to understand and use, and I love the syncing as well as reminders like my regular calendar! I do wish I could resize stickers (not sure if it's just me), and I would love a budgeting and fitness section as well! I am looking forward to using it more! I enjoy the FB group so far too!",1
Pretty good so far. I can't figure out how to make the font bigger is all.,1
"Cute, but not ¬£33 cute however it has the potential to become so.",1
Been my favorite electronic personal organizer yet! Not a 5 star as I cannot sort my lists A-Z yet.,1
Aesthetically pleasing though it didn't bring across the colours alreadybused in my google calendar which isnt too much of a big deal Only thing so far is I would rather have a 24hr clock option and that is rather annoying,1
"This is one of the apps that I've used for the longest time. It has a lot of flexibility and features. But I think the UI needs to be updated for a more modern look. Also, qukckly swiping through month view used to be very precise but not anymore.",1
"absolutely best planner! I use it for work and home life. Woth 4 kids and a career, it's a life saver!",1
I tried alot of free planners/agendas and nothing worked just right. I use my google calendar alot but felt I needed something more. I decided to go through the free trial and instantly I loved it. The price was a major concern for me as I am in Australia and the exchange rate put this close to $80. But I convinced myself after dividing it by the month. The biggest thing I love about this planner is that it syncs so beautifully with google and other devices.,1
I was using the free version for a long time before upgrading and had no issues with it. Upgraded mostly to support devs. It's been so long since I upgraded I don't remember exactly what changed with the paid version so I can't say wether it was worth it feature wise. Tagging locations has been a huge help since maps takes forever to open on my older phone. Being able to jump straight to directions from the widget on my home screen has been a life saver.,1
"Hands down, my new favorite calendar app. And Ive used just about all. I'm one of those with multiple Google and Outlook calendars, and needed a way to not only see multiple calendars, but easily add and sync in one interface. The template for appointments that dont recur at a regular intervals is a huge time saver. Color coding choices, drag and drop and the options for each entry are awesome. Multiple reminder times are a huge value. There's a ton more, premium version is worth the investment!",1
"This app is great! I've been using the paid version for several years since I've found the Google and Outlook apps to be limited in handling calendars from other systems. I especially like the way you can click on any combination of tabs at the bottom of the screen to view different calendars, with tab color coding that I can match to the font color of the appointments.",1
"This app has a lot of great function and I do enjoy using it. Only one thing is an issue. When syncing tasks across my two android devices there seems to be a lack of information transfered. To be specific, a task will sync to my other device but the time of the reminder and other details do not sync. It will simply show up on the other device as an ""all day"" task. Aside from that, this is a great app.",1
"Having used this app since the first version that this version replaced, there's literally nothing I can think of to add to this calendar app. It's fast, robust, configurable and dependable. I have it connected to three Gmail calendar accounts and have never had a problem. The price is fair and there's no goofing around with having to pay again if you get a new phone. Just reinstall and off you go. And the widget is so we'll done I basically never have to open the app.",1
"Using this paid calendar for more than a year. It does a great job at organizing multiple calendars. Lots of options. Occasionally it wouldn't sync with a Google calendar I had. The resolution is to have the Google calendar app installed (the blue 31 icon), but no need to use it. I've had the same issues with other calendars so I don't think it's specifically a problem with Business Calendar. Anyway, this calendar is great!",1
"This is the best Calendar app ever. I don't remember where I heard of it (some youtube tech channel), but I have been using it for years, and have had no issues with it. I love the customizability, and the widgets are perfect. It allows my to change font sizes, colors, add tasks, add in multiple calendars, etc. By far the best app.",1
"This is the best calendar on the planet. That seems like an exaggeration of course but I recently switched to iPhone and they don't have this calendar available and my life is now in shambles. You don't realize it's the littlest things that matter, like font size, or how many days you view at once (I prefer 3 week view), or even the shade of the color of the calendar or text. Business Calendar Pro has this all perfect. Perfect model of efficiency. You don't know what you've got until it's gone.",1
"I've been using this app for years to manage multiple Google calendars. The app is highly customizable, gives much better control over reminders than the Google Calendar app, and can also access / manage tasks from Google accounts as well. It takes some time to get the settings exactly the way you want them, but the app functionality is well worth the time spent setting it up. Also, the few times I have contacted customer service, they have always been quick to reply and fix issues.",1
"Been a great app for a couple of years now but lately having problems, all the recurring (yearly) entries are coming up more than a dozen times on the same day - it's like the software is picking up all the calendar events for the upcoming years and placing all those entries on the same date... serious bug.  -UPDATE: The programmers contacted me quickly - I have looked at the Samsung calendar on the phone and it works perfectly‚Ä¶ no duplication of future recurring events. I deleted and reinstalled the app with no success. - thanks.  Update: the calendar team contacted me and helped me work through my issue - fantastic support !",1
"Update 1/2022. Still great! Calendaring needs have changed between needing access to Outlook and tasks. Still meets all my needs. Best feature is being able to easily turn on and off specific calendars so I can easily see personal only or include work, tasks, other family calendars Original: Used for years. it stays easy and intuitive to use. Quite useful for easy access to multiple calendars.",1
"Been using this app or the one before it for years now. It's a great app that has only improved with time. Loving the new colors. Only thing I could wish for is a more customizable print page, but it's rare that I need to print my calendar. It's one of the few where I paid for the upgrade, mostly out of appreciation for a well done, well supported app. Not in any way affiliated with the app, nor did I receive anything for this review.",1
"I've been using it for the past 4 (now 6) years. I *really* wish there was a PC version so I could manage tasks at work, without looking like I was on my phone all the time. It has features I can't find, a small memory foot print, and integrated so well. It's better than any PC app, paid or free, w/ a mobile sync app.",1
"I have tried a number of Android calendar apps, and this is the first one I've found that has all the features and affordances I've looked for, centering on both easily and rapidly creating events, and moving/rescheduling events and contiguous blocks of events. It's not perfect, but it's pretty awesome. Two thumbs way up!",1
"I'm using this to budget and I don't like Google's calendar. I got my entire months expenses mapped out and then had to delete an entry. Turns out you have to pay for that option. But I don't even mind. Loving the UI and how easy it is to use. Beautiful and helpful app. Entirely worth the one time price of 7.99$! Yep, it's not a subscription which is rare these days and I appreciate that too.",1
"I am extremely happy with this calendar, I have been using it for a few years now. it integrates seemlessly from google calendar, rarely glitches. There is more customization available in this app than any other calendar app that i know of (I'm picky with what i want my calendar to look like and do). i It even has more customization than i need. It works well right away with minimal setup, but during the first few weeks and months you will want to customize. It takes time to learn all features",1
"Amazingly useful. I've been using Business Calendar for years. It has some indispensable features that Google Calendar app just can't do. For example, being able to push selection of events in time by specified number of days, and have them all adjust relative to their original date. Brilliant! Or drag and drop for events. Google finally added this to their app maybe a couple of years ago, and it still doesn't work as well as the one in Business Cal. Business Cal allows you to adjust the length of events via intuitive sliding bars, where as GCal's events have to be adjusted via standard numerical inputs. Business Calendar has a ton of other useful features that are well worth the price of the app.",1
"The best feature is the customizable widget. Better than any other calendar, let's me match it to my phone perfectly. The UX is good but could use a bit of simplification. Also wish that when creating a calendar event, if I need to switch to another app to find information, it should retain my in progress event creation as a draft. Instead i have to start over.",1
"Great calendar app, constantly improving but without ruining it or making the kind of changes that force you to relearn everything. its readily solid. A long time ago I paid for premium, so I'm not sure what's included in the free version. but at the time it was also very good. Never have any problems with this calendar app interfacing with Google either. it's just really solid. Love all the color options. Very customizable. Recommend.",1
"Have used this for years, still love it. Favorite feature is the ability to quickly see/hide different calendars with the buttons on the month view. Top features: pop up details on the monthly view, Google maps location link, Emojis, repeat event customization, search calendar. Very customizable. tons of features. Works great cross platform and with subscribed calendars to pull in our many family activities. I use 2 widgets together .. 1) daily list view 2)monthly view.",1
"I love this app. I keep the month calendar widget on my home screen at all times. Really efficient app and easy to learn. Every now and then it has a problem loading, but that is rare. Definitely get the paid version for no ads. It also opens up some other options for customization. It's well worth it considering a planner at a store will probably cost twice as much (or more) and only be good for one year. Edit: still using it",1
"Much easier to set multiple reminders because it remembers your past custom times. The Improvement that I would love to see is allowing the user to set multiple reminders at the same time without having to select them one at a time. there is nothing in the upgrade that I would use, otherwise, I would certainly pay a fee so they could keep this handy little program that has tiny little features that make it easier to use then all the others. for me anyway.",1
"Best calendar I've had!!! I bought the upgraded version and I love it! I have tried out MANY different calendars through out the year and this has been by far the best I have ever used. It is customizable and easy to use. I can copy events to multiple days, delete multiple things at ones and the widgets they have shows me everything I need it to. It even has a task list that doesn't have to clutter up the month view. And if you have multiple calendars you can easily select what 1s u want to see.",1
"I uninstalled üëâand reinstalledüëà the BC app about a week ago while reorganizing my phone to help prepare for the school year. After reinstalling the app, the widget hasn't come back. BC is pretty good when the the widget is functional and operational but not having it lowkey defeats the purpose. Please respond, will be happy to raise review for a prompt and helpful answer that helps me get the widget up again. Thank you. üëâEdit:üëà To get the widget up, I just pressed and held home screen.",1
"Ever in love with Business Calendar 2! It's configuration settings are of sublime finesse. For example, you can move events in 5 minute increments or even 1 minute increments. It's especially useful when moving events, as it's better than other options do on both desktop and mobile applications. Would utmost recommend to those seek a power-calendar app!",1
"The Best Calendar App that joins outlook, Google and device calendars in one view. You can toggle calendars on or off. Move calendar events. The syncing is more reliable and quicker on the app. I can see my work outlook and then my personal Google calendar. I can add events to any calendar. Reminders can be customized. You can create templates appointments for any calendar. Change colors. Customize the look of the month, week view. The widget has many viewing settings. User over 5 years.",1
"Extensive customizing options are sure to make this just how you want. My eyesight isnt what it used to be, so being able to pick senior friendly UI options is my first criteria for any app. Now having so many options, there are a few that are a little awkward to figure out. Big problem is you cant export & restore all the preferences you spent so much time setting up. So on my next phone upgrade, I'll probably try another app. There's no way I will waste my time to manually transfer my prefs.",1
"I've tried other calendars, and I just love the layout. If only the widget layout can be changed when first opened. But it shows everything I need very easily. I can share my calendar with other people. I can change the colors. Another recommendation is to gain more colors for the appointments. :) Overall, super happy. Will not be choosing another calendar!",1
"Finally after years if trying! I've tried a number of calendar apps and this is the best buy far. I wanted to be able to scroll the calendar one week at a time, so I could see the next few weeks- this one does it well. Displays several calendars at the same time clearly, option of color bars or details... so many features that make sense. Almost a year later, I still love this calendar and I've told a number of friends about it. Every once in a while I discover another nice feature- well done!",1
"This calendar application is fantastic and it is very easy to use. The best thing about it is that you can set multiple events and reminders. It's great that it has up to 5 reminders that you can set, for an event that you've made. There's also a custom setting for setting reminders to any specific time of your choosing. I'm also glad that it doesn't have autocorrect. There are convenient weekly monthly and yearly views to choose from. Great calendar application! I highly recommended it!",1
"ƒ∞ncredible utility. Perfect for people with ADHD who need a time structure for their college/job. Lets you visualize everything you have to do with blocks of time. Helps with everything from planning studying to workout sessions, it's really a game changer. The app is convenient and intuitive. There is a premium version, which is useful enough that it's worth upgrading to if you're busy and need it, but it's also very usable without, for which ƒ∞ give high praise to the developers.",1
"It's a calendar app. The job is pretty straightforward, but it does it very well, quickly, and in a nice interface. Specific items: syncing with Tasks is great. Syncing with other to-do apps like TickTick would be dreamy, but that's asking a bit much. Being able to set defaults for making new events is good. The color scheme is nice and not all blinding shades like many apps, and I love how customizable it is. I haven't used event ""Groups"" but it looks like a great feature. TLDR great app",1
"Very nice calendar to keep track of my schedule. I really like this one and use it instead of Samsung's. The only things I would change is: I use it in the monthly view, but once I add an appt, it doesn't go back to month view. Also, I wish I could see more description of the appt in the monthly view. It only shows the first few words, then cuz off. Regardless, I love the customization and will gladly continue using this great planner!!",1
"As an old PalmOS user, I have looked great and wide for something that integrates calendar, address book, phone, to do list etc. This app is the closest I've found and is my go to calender app. I would take off 1/2 star off if Google play would let me sure to the way phone numbers are handled. The software dials the numbers in the linked contact's address instead of the phone number. There is a work around but it takes multiple screen taps.",1
"I've been using this app for years now and I love it. The widget is perfect for checking off little tasks/due dates that you might otherwise forget about. I upgraded to the pro version, which allows you to have repeating tasks that you can check off once a week, once a month, the third Saturday of every month, etc. It can sync with your email and automatically add in flights/important dates from your calendar. I can't even tell you how much this app has improved the organization in my life",1
Update: there was some issue with Android and Google calendar syncing which was fixed by contacting Google. Now the only problem I have is that one of my recurring work meetings does not show up. I'm guessing it's still an Android issue. I installed the app (a few times) but it crashes the moment I give it permission to my calendar. Any thoughts on what might be happening? I was hoping to use it instead of my Google calendar.,1
Great app with all the needed features,1
Got things done,1
"Calendar works just fine. Working with tasks and to do lists is sometimes confusing. UPDATE. This app continues to be improved, with a good balance between options and ease of use. No hesitation in a full endorsement.",1
I have been using this app for several years on multiple devices and can't do without it.,1
Nice app....works well. I'm still using this app.,1
Last review I did was 2016. I've used this app for 8 years and still love it,1
"superb calendar. the repeating reminders work like a charm. the voice input is reliable, the flexibility is outstanding. Been using it for 4 + years and can't say enough good things about it",1
"When setting up multiple calendars for different types of scheduling work, volunteer work and time with the family, it so much easier to share the individual calendars with those that need to know about those schedules. Though, don't need to see your entire calendar. It makes checking availability easier, from your desktop or your smartphones. Recommended!",1
Love it. Easy to setup my schedule on it,1
Does what I need,1
Good app that allows attachments and more options than outlook.,1
I love this app that helps me easy to make my schedules and keep me on point.,1
"My favorite app. This is the best app I've ever used!!! It just keeps getting better and better. It's like the app reads my mind and anticipates what I want to do. The longer/more I use it, the better it gets at almost anticipating what I want/need to do next. Especially, now with my new Windows 11 laptop, it's even more convenient and helpful + printing is easier. MW",1
Love this app!,1
Has been the best calendar app for many years. However the app contains: 21 trackers 34 permissions,1
"Useful. I like the layout flexibility and widgets, but mainly use it because of the ability to set up new calendar entry templates. For instance, I automatically include invites to my business and wife's calendars to share awareness of my personal schedule, and this saves time vs manually adding the info to every appointment. I've used this product for many years... Probably more than a decade, and have purchased the paid version. Well worth the investment for me.",1
Been using this app daily for almost 8 years - enough said. üôÇ,1
"3/29/2023 I still use this calendar, it meets my needs and have no reason to change! I really enjoy this calendar app. I've tried many and I've stayed with this. I haven't tried the paid version (pro), which seems to have some good options (just don't want to pay for yet another app to get full benefits). The unpaid version has everything you need. (Update: I've paid for the Pro version because I really like this app. I like the added benefits of the Pro version).",1
"I'm not organized & lose everything but my phone. I went ahead and bit the bullet and purchased the pro version it was $8 or $9. I've used it for 3 days but I'm thrilled. I just recently started a new position in my company that comes w/ more paperwork, stress, & responsibility. I wasn't sure how I was going to keep track of it all. I spent a day inputting all my tasks personal & professional. I can toggle b/t lists easy & my stress has decreased dramatically. Buy the pro version & play with it",1
"I have used only this app for my MULTIPLE calendars for as long as I can remember. I've gone through over a decade of being a college student, a theatrical professional managing simultaneous projects for several theaters, working several jobs at the same time, and keeping multiple personal calendars - this is the only app I've found that could keep up. I have three of this app's widgets on my home screens. If you're a calendar superuser, this app is absolutely essential.",1
"Excellent calendar app with great flexibility in setting up reminders, allowing for several different notifications for each calendar entry. Allows for including addresses in the calendar entry so that you can just tap on the address and have a navigational map pop up. Easy to use, very reliable, incredibly flexible in allowing choice in which entries might be shared and which are private.",1
"Excellent calendar and productivity app. Granular, intuitive, and comprehensive sertings. Use the schedule with integrated task view most often and appreciate the ability to customize virtually every aspect of their appearance. Using app as main calendar and scheduler since 2015 and have no reason or need to switch due to its comprehensive settings.",1
"I have been using this app for years now. I have tried other calendar apps on Android and IOS and this is by far my favorite apps. It may not have a bubbly interface like other calendars but the features are great, especially if you have multiple calendars to manage. The features that get added are helpful and useful as well. Thank you for a great app.",1
"Great app. My focus is mainly on the calendar, and all the features for it allow complicated and repeating appointments to be accomplished with ease. Sync works seamlessly with Google on calendar; however, my to do list got wiped out when i switched phones, so it does need to be be made more clear whether certain elements are being synced or backed up or not.",1
I'm a fan! (Better than Google Calendar). I like the view and funtionality of this app and use it on both my phone and my computer (Chromebook). I prefer it over the stock apps and it integrates really well with my Google Account calendars.,1
"I've been using this app for years and loved it. It synced all my calendars and also synced the app I use to schedule clients for my business. I've noticed the last couple of days it's not updating my business appointments, do I have to purchase the pro version for this option to work now or is it a glitch? Uodate: It seems to be an issue with my phone, not sure what exactly , but it takes a long time for it to sync. Thank you for your response.",1
"This calendar out of the box (so to speak) worked perfect for me. I had very little setup to do to serve my purposes. It has all events from my emails, contacts birthdays, notes that I put in, etc. This is better for me than Blik, DigiCal which I actually paid for, and just recently been having issues with sync, dates not showing up, etc. Good job. I will happily be paying for the pro version",1
"I purchased the app 6 months ago. Until I tried it I had never made a purchase on the app store and I haven't made any others to this day. You can save appointment templates which saves tons of time when adding to your calendar in the future. It has customizable widgets, task lists with reminders and priorities and so much more! I have recommended it to all of my friends and family. Whether an on the go cyber schooling mom like me or a anyone else, there is something in this app for everyone.",1
"I'm really picky when it comes to calendar apps, so it took me a long time of trial and error to find one that had everything I wanted. This app is the closest thing to perfection in terms of things I wanted off my checklist. The one thing I really, really wish this app has is the ability to writes notes. That option would be such a game changer for me! Please do this!",1
"I have used Business Calendar for several years now and love it. Things I like especially: 1) I can create and use local calendars. 2) The Favorites Bar makes it easy to toggle visibility of just the calendars I want to see. 3) Backup and import on its own is worth paying for the pro version. Has made moving my calendar from one phone to another so easy. I had tried three other popular calendar apps, but each had compromises. Business Calendar does everything well, and I couldn't be happier.",1
"Been using this app for many years, and each update makes it better. Developers are continually improving it, even with a one-time license purchase (very rare these days). Coordinates well with Google Calendars and phone contacts, and has tremendous flexibility due to its many options. I'm an old PIM user from decades past, which is why Business Calendar was the first app I loaded on a smart phone.",1
"I've used Business Calendar 2 for many years and I absolutely love it! The layout, the color options, and the widgets are spectacular. The only thing I don't like about it is it's not available with iOS. I recently switched to iPhone from Android and I still haven't chosen a calendar for iOS because none of them compare to Business Calendar 2. I lug around my tablet so I can use the calendar.",1
I have the purchased version. I love that they have more colors. Love that each event can have a reminder which can be customized. I love that different email calendars can be incorporated into 1 calendar. My husband and I both have the same calendar on our phones and each update on the other's phone appears in the calendar. I have had this app for 3 years. So far so good.,1
"Fantastic calendar! Recent updates bring support for Microsoft calendars. Unfortunately, recurring events on Team's calendars are only shown for the upcoming few weeks and not their full duration.",1
"My go-to calendar for YEARS. I love the options, how it let's me put in all the details I need, send invites, color-coded, manage multiple accounts. Only complaint is with location - I think you used to be able to put in the name of where you were going and it would find all that info and save it for you. Now you have to know the exact address. It's not a deal breaker, just a feature I miss.",1
"I love Business Calendar! I love being able to color code my ""appointments"" (actual appointments, but also many reminders of things to do, plus birthdays, anniversaries, etc). It occasionally asks me to upgrade to the paid Pro version, but I personally do not have any need for the additional options included with the Pro version. I tried a few other calendar apps (including Google's) but I much prefer this one!! Keep up the good work üëå 5 years later & Business Calendar is still the bestüòéü•≥üññ",1
Foarte utilƒÉ! recomand. dau doar 4 stele pentru cƒÉ optiunea de export calendar ar trebui sa fie disponibilƒÉ nu numai in varianta Pro ...,1
"I strongly recomment that you will not use this app if you use outlook calendars! Fantastic App but only for those using Gmail. With outlook you will meet various problems.I realized this after purchasing full ap. Also Tasks posiible only by Google Tasks and attachments only Google Drive and Dropbox (One Drive not available)!!! Update: After installing Blue Mail app, syncing is working smoothly... Please give solution for outlook users and add outlook tasks. If bluemail could it then yo also do",1
Good app! Replaced Business Calendar when latest update made day numbers disappear... Don't people check their revisions anymore???,1
"Great Calendar, worthy of 5 stars UNLESS you need to use the Tasks section. I can't have a set task every Monday at 8:45am. I click on every Monday but only the first day shows. Sad. I emailed them and learned that although it only shows the next occurrence, it will update each week. One star upped to 4 stars. If I'm looking at a day, months in advance, I need to know what tasks are for that day.",1
"Wish the date would show on the app on the homescreen, without having to open it to find out the date today üòï",1
"When setting up multiple calendars for different types of scheduling work, volunteer work and time with the family, it so much easier to share the individual calendars with those that need to know about those schedules. Though, don't need to see your entire calendar. It makes checking availability easier, from your desktop or your smartphones. Recommended!",1
"I was very close to transitioning to using this app and buying the paid version. The integration with my Google Calendar is great, but Google Tasks is not. The time and other details don't sync, which the devs did clarify is a limitation of Google's API. I appreciate the info density, but the UI just feels cramped, IMO. Great app; would strongly consider again if a web or a cross-platform app is made, or if/when Google lifts their API limitations.",1
"My favorite app. This is the best app I've ever used!!! It just keeps getting better and better. It's like the app reads my mind and anticipates what I want to do. The longer/more I use it, the better it gets at almost anticipating what I want/need to do next. Especially, now with my new Windows 11 laptop, it's even more convenient and helpful + printing is easier. MW",1
"I'm 66 and am so thrilled - as soon as i took a couple of the numerous tutorials Business Calendar offers (free and very accessible) I quickly saw how clear and intuitive this app's design is! This confirmed what so many reviewers had said. I've been using it somewhat constantly for five weeks and i love it. The best calendar app out there, as many users agree. And when i have a question, the answer is found fast. Thank you!",1
"Superb and professional design. Intuitive and innovative. Jam-packed with easy to navigate customizations and with a clean and roomy interface. I can see way more events on each day... No more having to tap the day to see all the events if I have more than 3. On all the other calendar apps you get a little plus button at the bottom... This one can fit a ton more, like 10 maybe. You can customize font size so you see more calendar data. Most legit calendar app.",1
"I have been using business calendar for years, and imo, it's the best there is. The price is more than fair, and upgrades are always an improvement over previous versions. It's obvious that they put a lot of thought into it. Aside from the app being terrific, the customer support is stellar. Anytime I have a question, they respond RIGHT AWAY, and the answers are thorough and beyond helpful. You can tell that they truly care. Thank you Business Calendar!",1
"Update: This is just an update to say I continue to use and love BC2. I have tried other apps but either they lack the features or have expensive subscriptions. Kudos to the developers here! I have been using this app for at least a few years now. I love that I can see my calendar appointments and tasks in a single, integrated view. They also continue to add new features and are quick to respond to questions... All for a very low cost, especially compared to the subscription services.",1
"Don't be fooled by the generic name, this is the best mobile calendar app on the play store. It's extremely customizable and has features like being able to drag and drop events and being able to multiselect events and move them all at once in case something comes up or a meeting runs long. It had lots of little quality of life features like a button to postpone tasks or events until Tomorrow if they are overdue. This app changed my mind about mobile calendars and how they're not all annoying.",1
"I've been using this app for years and it is the best one out there. You can view your busy schedule in different ways, and it's easy to take a quick glance at it to see where you still have openings. I am a hair stylist and I need to spot an available opening quickly. You can search for your customers name to find their past or future appointments, and you can design it to the color schemes of your choice and make quick edits, repeat appointments, add reminders and addresses that link to maps.",1
"Great calendar app! I've used versions of this app for years to keep my jobs, appointments, events, and reminders recorded. Adding info to the events is easy. Color specification is an easy visual way to keep different types of events straight, an rearranging events is as easy as click, drag and release. It's been an inseparable party of my life for quite a while now.",1
"I have used this calendar app on and off since 2014. I recently came back, & I love it. I have 2 personal and 6 work calendars across 2 Google accounts, and this app pulls them all together beautifully; I much prefer the aesthetics of this app over the stock Google calendar app. I have also installed BC2 on my Windows 11 PCs using the Android subsystem for Linux. I need to print copies of my work calendars, & the results from this app on my PC are much better than my previous solution.",1
"I really like how tasks are handled. You can be very descriptive, see them all in one view, and move them to the next day easily. Though l, I did pay the pro price to get recurring tasks. The day view is good too. It's like an agenda, but without the details, it gives a good view of the time you'll be using. The pop-up on the monthly view to see the day and add to it is also convenient. If you sync it to Google Cal, it is a full sync. What you do on one shows on the other.",1
"It is a great calendar, though it is dependent on your original calendar.",1
It's a good calendar app with decent features.,1
"Pou≈æ√≠vam niekoƒæko rokov, veƒæmi dobr√°.",1
good calendar app,1
"I find copying or moving appointments to be a little cumbersome, but otherwise it's intuitive, easy to use and at this point I completely rely on it as an essential tool on my phone.",1
"Everything about this is what I want, except I can't turn Holidays completely off. I don't want to see giant color blocks of holidays that get in the way of my events. I want a calendar that I can glance at and see my events easily.",1
I like this App but would love to change the start of the week to Sunday as it's always been the 1st day of the weeknhere in Australia. Otherwise it's a good App.,1
"I really like the customization features of this app! Been using it for a while and enjoy it because I'm not a ""heavy"" calendar user but like flexibility. Just wish notifications worked better.",1
"Rough spots, I just want a reliable schedule and record",1
I'm finding it useful and easy to use. Also any event I create gets automatically updated in Google calendar.,1
"Very common sense. Once installed, it had all my dates and events in there. Effortless.",1
"Love the app and use it as my main calendar and to-do list. However, it would be nice to be able to view the tasks sidebar while on week view, particularly on wider displays such as tablets or laptops. Also, the Windows interface is poor (relies on Windows Subsystem for Android). Another minor suggestion: allow custom week numbers. Useful for students who operate on an academic calendar, with week 1 usually being somewhere in September.",1
"Great app, but you can only paste a copied event to one date at a time. The navigation area still stays pure black which looks unfinished, and the app icon was clearly designed by a 5 year old. App name also should be one word to save needless text. 5 star potential plus the wearOS companion is excellent. Edit: I see the Dev has provided an unrelated link and my points remain 100% true",1
"if I can add events on the watch without connecting to the phone, I will buy the app and give it 5 stars.",1
"UI is a bit dated, but very customizable, and most of all, no subscriptions/cloud. Recommend for those looking for a no-BS, private calendar/tasks unifier with good widgets.",1
"great app! love how easy it is to move an appointment if it gets rescheduled. one thing I would love or perhaps I just don't know how to work it, but tasks that I forget to do, I wish would remind me that I still need to do it. I have a recurring task to replace a filter but I forgot one month and it was never completed so the next three months I never did it because the task wasn't there!",1
"Still the best calendar feature for me. I can add and track very quickly, look up or change, the color coding option is one of my favorite things and to put things like reoccurring payments on the same day for a certain period of time all at once!, really great!! I'm not sure how to improve this app, but,, if YOU come up with something new, I'm sure I will use and enjoy it!",1
"Genuinely impressed with how good this calendar looks and functions. Solid updates give me lots of ways to create and view events and tasks. Also has wonderful widget designs and plenty of ways to customize it so you can get exactly the info you want. The Group functionality of being able to put various calendars and tasks (across your calendar accounts) into easily switchable ""toggles"" is something I haven't seen implemented as well in any other calendar app. An essential app. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",1
"So detailed. Organize anything by color, days of the week, events, and tasks. Monthly, weekly, daily, agenda and task view! Perfect for the ADD. Import and push sync with Google calendar. Location in events even links to Google maps. Customize everything! There is an add when you add an event, but no need to purchase for useful features. I'm probably gonna purchase out of sheer gratitude.",1
"SO much prettier and customizable than Google calendar! I used this wonderful app for a few months, then upgraded to the pro version -- then switched to Google calendar when I bought the Galaxy s10. Big mistake. Google calendar is ugly and brash compared to BC2. I came back! Love all the options, themes, colors, and it syncs perfectly. Get it!",1
"About a month using this. Great views. I badly needed custom colors for appointments, I like the widgets & linking appointments to contacts without inviting them is just great, too. I have a 24 hr weekly view, stretch it to keep business hours on the screen & I just scroll a little to see early & late items. This began and ended my search for a calendar app. Certainly there are more features to be discovered, but for now, I'm just thankful to have it.",1
"I truly, literally, honestly would not be able to keep track of my life without this app. I have seven calendars and a task list synced to my device. I'm able to color code each calendar and appointments within those calendars, plus add emojis if I need an appointment to ""pop."" The android widget is fantastic (mine is set as my home screen so I always see what's coming up). Cannot recommend this app more highly. I would give 50 stars if the option was available.",1
"3 yes happy user of business calendar. best app I ever installed The must-have feature for me is the widget adjusted to full screen size and set to agenda view. I tweak the colors: gold for the date and blue for the event/appt time. I reduce the font size so I can see the coming few days all on one screen with great clarity. It's a superb way to organize and view my calendar and to do list combined. I dont use tasks, I make each to do item an untimed event on the appropriate day. Just brilliant",1
"I have an odd schedule for work (4 week rotation) and this app let's you customize really well in reoccurring events such as this. I also have another shared email address for band gigs that I was able to sync up. I can now switch between each one and create, edit, or delete whatever events I need to. I recommend this app. The only negative that is slightly annoying is the more you use it, it has a list that pops up of past events you created when creating one and sometimes duplicates the name.",1
"I've used paid version for years and it's been great except for the occasional glitch, usually solved by reinstalling the app. But now an event is suddenly just not showing up. I've checked everything, tried sync, install/uninstall, change color of event, toggle bottom menu tabs, checked which calendar it's on, checked if event shows on google calendar app, etc. But no, the issue is with business cal. I would have completely missed this important event if I hadn't checked my calendar on my laptop. Please fix this, a calendar that skips events is useless.",1
Best Calendar app! Makes my Google apps obsolete as it integrates my calendar and tasks joined seamlessly into one place. Love the ability to add links to the descriptions (and even customize the fonts!) and gives me quick access to event locations with one click. The widgets are so easy to use. Love the customizable everything. How do I get this app for IOS?? My fiance is struggling with staying organized with their janky calendar options...,1
"Love it!! Was previously using the Calendar app Informant and got tired of them forcing you to repurchase their app (at high costs) just to continue on with their updates, so I tried this. It does everything and more that the other one did and so far they have only made me buy it once (as it should be!) I can't speak for the adds as I did purchase the full product since it is a great app and I wanted to support the developers. I would highly recommend it!",1
"This is the perfect calendar for me. I searched for a long time to find a calendar that would allow me to color-code my different entries. Using the local calendar option, I can differentiate between my personal appointments and my volunteer hours, simply by making each event their own separate calendar and then assigning the calendars different colors. Thank you sooooo much!",1
"This is the best calendar, hands down. It is the only place I can access all my calendars together AND modify them all. I use an Outlook calendar for work and multiple Google calendars for me, my aging parents, and my husband. I appreciate that I can employ various colors for different tasks, that I can contact someone directly from an appointment, and that each view conveys A LOT of information - especially for a small screen. Outstanding App!",1
"I've used this calendar for many years and am REALLY happy with it. I have a lot of accounts with MANY calendars and I love how I can see them all in this one app (with very little effort to set up). A favorite feature is grouping calendars into favorites - with 1 tap I can show/hide the group. I love showing 2 days as my default, but easily slide to show more days. So easy to add an event to any calendar or copy to another one. I have the paid version and it was definitely worth it! LOVE it!!",1
"This is a great option, until you find a better alternative. I've tried out several calendar apps and stuck with this one the longest. Luckily i just found aCalendar and will be moving to that. The good: this calendar is rock solid under the hood. I've had it for over a year and have zero complaints on bugs. Also very cool that they don't bombard you with ads. The bad: imo the features in the free version are lacking. And there's not much more in the pay version that makes me want to upgrade.",1
"The simple customization of which calendars are showing with bars at the bottom of the screen is handy, and the widget with a customized compact agenda has been part of my home screens for years. The previous and current versions are 2 of the best app purchases I've made and certainly the most regularly used along with Nine. This shows my Nine (Exchange) calendars with no problems.",1
"Been using this app for years and finally purchased the ad free version because the ads were really too intrusive and annoying - that's my only issue with the free version. The amount of customization, especially with the widgets, is amazing. Syncs seamlessly with all my calendars, and the notifications and agenda keep me on track. Haven't found a better calendar app yet.",1
"This is, by far, THE BEST app for keeping organized! Only thing I would suggest is an option to save info daily so that if someone's phone breaks they do not lose all their plans! Also would help to be able to actually talk to someone for technical help or about suggestions to make the app better. Otherwise, extremely impressed with this app! The amount of fore thought it took to come up with all the features that are available surpasses ANY other app I use for my business. Good job!",1
Great tool! Though only way I was able to get support was to complain here since I don't use email on my phone. I was able to remove the tasks from cluttering the month view by disabling them in the app settings completely but then enabling them in the widget where I wanted to see them in my agenda. It's a little convoluted but works.,1
"The best, most thorough calendar app for mobile. I cannot for the life of me figure out why they leave $ on the table by not porting to iPhone. I have not found a better app for multiple calendars on either mobile platform. Data entry is smooth. Calendar & time pickers make sense. Multiple views. The # of days slider makes navigation easier than other apps I've tried. Would give this 11 if I could. Kept me on Android through multiple device upgrade cycles.",1
"This app is a great app for beginners/small businesses. The free version allows you to do enough in the calendar, without obtrusive/disruptive ads. This allows someone to transition into the full version when they their business grow making the app a true asset. Of note, I am not against ads. I understand that this provides much needed operating revenue for the companies to maintain the app. But when the app has loud ads that cannot be even silenced this is a big turnoff for me.",1
"I've been really happy with this calendar app. The ability to group calendars and turn the groups off and on is super useful to me. Update- I'm editing this review 3 years later because today I've realized that this app has been rock solid and completely dependable, and usefully innovative since I installed it. It's always been a 5 star app to me. And I don't ever rate with 5 stars.",1
"Update: finally figured out how to fix the views!!üéâ I appreciate several aspects of customization, not the least of which is hiding duplicate effects in multiple calendars üíñüôèüôè Original: The only app of SEVERAL that I've tried today to actually show others' calendars!! üî•üî•üî•üî•üëèüëèüëè Good job! Everything is clean, customizable, and amazing!!! Props to you all, it is clearly very hard to do this, based on every other app I've seen that does not come anywhere close.",1
I haved used this Calender for my business for over 10 years. It has been a very important part of running my business. The customer service has been very attentive in the past. Although I only reached out to them once about 6 years ago. They immediately reached back out to me to solve my issue. Which I appreciated since I ran my business off of this app. I have it installed in all my work vans. Any job added or edited in the office show up immediately for my techs in the field.,1
"I use this planner as a replacement for a standard Google calendar. I like it so far; it works just fine and I find interface is slightly better than at original app. Icon is cute but sometimes looks like number ""30"" not letters ""BC"" but this is my personal issue. No glitches and noticeable bugs so I gave it 5 stars.",1
"Love this calander, ADD/ADHD persons best friend. Got it specifically for the drag/drop and drag/copy options. It also has great template and color coding functions which make it super easy for st a glance scheduling. I still make hand written lists but it also has list and task functions as well if you're a list person.",1
"I have been using this app since I started my small business last fall. This has turned out to be an essential asset to managing my jobs. Its simple, self explanatory. I had know idea it would become my right arm. The more I've used it, the more I've discovered. Most of all. Its free. I haven't noticed any ads. I highly recommend this app for the small business person, who might not now their way around more sophisticated apps. 1 YR LATER Im still using this and have no complaints",1
"love the app and best I've used! However I started having an issue with one of my outlook calendars. When I add an event from my computer, it displays the event one day prior on my phone. If I add the event from my phone using the app, is displays correctly on the computer. I have 5 other calendars, most from outlook, and all others work just fine. update- works fine now all of a sudden. not sure what happened. thanks",1
"Our goto calendar app. Highly configurable app that allows us to get the appearance, font sizes, etc exactly as we like it. Subtle things like the ability to give entries slightly rounded corners makes it easier to see back to back items. Full functionality in all the different areas. The only thing it can't do is to be able to create a Google Meet video call at the same time you create a calendar entry. But I think Google keeps that capability just for themselves. Highly recommended.",1
"The best calendar app‚Äîhaving relished it for nearly three and a half years! It's utmost more versatile than Google Calendar, as it includes a day slider view, history of past event titles (upon typing them), and multi-selection feature for copying and deleting. Plus, it's comparably quicker and snappier! ‚ö° Pro version is totally worth it. The latest update is amazing! The UI is even better‚Äîsuper clean and modern. Keep it up!",1
"I love this calendar. It has nice features, like adding an appointment in your email straight into your phone.s calendar. It.s not hard to use, to change months, you just go up and right and click settings and click "" go to' and say you want january, you just select it and you can enter info on any day and you.ll be able to look in January and see appointments, birthdays, or any important events.It helps you keep your life organized so easily. I really use it most every day.",1
"Best calendar app I've ever seen, especially for neuro-atyp people. It is way more customizable than others, so be patient with the process at first while setting everything up. Repeating daily tasks have a convenient function, where they only show in ""today"", and as soon as you complete them they will migrate themselves to the following day. The only thing I can think of improving is if you could increase the number of reminders for an event.",1
"It does way more than what I need it to do, but what it does it does really well. I love the agenda feature and the ability to group the calendars and/or tasks together so that I can display them easily. I like the ability to customize the display. I wish I could uninstall the original app that I purchased, business calendar, so that I didn't have to always have both apps installed. But the license apparently is attached to the first calendar. I've used this calendaring app for years.",1
"YES YES YES!! I have been looking for a great schedule/agenda/calendar map for centuries!! The thing I really wanted to have was a widget to put on one of my pages where I could see one week at the time, both visually (each day has its own column with different colors for different events) and verbally (each event has written inside what it is). Most other apps have simply a list of the events per day, without breaking them down visually for duration and the such. Amazing app! Love it!",1
"Love it. FREEKING LOVE IT!!!! I just wish there were a way to create ""priority"" days, where you could highlight the entire block of day to make it stand out. This app has a high level of customization, however, FAR more than any other calendar app. And what's cool is that you can customize it to be very, very simple and dumbed down if you so choose so it's perfect for every user's needs. LET'S GET THAT PRIORITY DATE BLOCK GOING!! Lol =)",1
"Works nicely. I use this to merge 2 outlook calendars and one Google calendar. I do have an issue with one of my outlook calendars arbitrarily stopping to update, and while I don't think it's this apps problem, it would be VERY helpful if this app warned me of the situation. Because, when this occurs, you simply think you're free at certain times, when in fact those times are only showing free because a calendar has stopped updating.",1
"So far I love this app. It takes the tedium out of staying on top of tasks, and it keeps me organized. I look forward to continuing to learn new things about it!",1
üòé,1
Great calendar! More than I really need. Really customizable.,1
"Wish I had found this sooner! I have always been a die hard paper planner person. But it was awkward to drag around and so often, I didn't have it in front of me when I needed to. Artful agenda is amazing! I love that it looks like my paper planner with monthly, weekly, daily sheets, along with meal planning and tasks. Plus, I can have it open on my desktop to keep up with things and can also use my phone and my tablet so I am literally never without it. And it's user-friendly!!",1
ADHD FRIENDLY!!,1
Excellent solution to my needs,1
Just as good as my favorite paper planner!,1
SOOOOO worth paying for!! The BEST electronic Day Planner EVER!! Have been using it for a few months now. You will NOT be disappointed.,1
after re installing it appears to be fixed!,1
This app has been so helpful with my small business!,1
Sounds great I'm downloading now!,1
"I emailed a question, and they got back to me very quickly. I've tried other digital planners before and found them confusing. This one is easy to use and understand. Love the portability of this.",1
Good linking of multiple calendars in gsuite and ical formats. Love the rolling to do list and different views,1
I love this digital planner. It has the look and feel of a paper planner and it really helps me keep on track.,1
Love this. Use different colors for each person. Also reminds me when I have appt. Can change your cover. Wonderful app,1
I really love this agenda. It is exactly the way i wanted an agenda.,1
First time I enjoyed a digital planner,1
"I absolutely love this planner, so easy to sync with other devices. I have been looking for this kind of a planner for ages.",1
"This is my everyday goto! I cannot function without it! Beautiful layouts, fun stickers, easy-to-use. The cross platform is so great too. I'd love to see more font options in the future.",1
"I just love it! The color coding, the stickers, especially the Bible and church stickers!!!",1
It's pretty and the best digital transition from paper planner. Love the ability to connect to the family calendar on Google and add my own stickers/organization. The lists features are great too.,1
Well thought out and comprehensive calendar app. Business Calendar is still improving and the integrations with Outlook are a valuable addition.,1
"Superb and professional design. Intuitive and innovative. Jam-packed with easy to navigate customizations and with a clean and roomy interface. I can see way more events on each day... No more having to tap the day to see all the events if I have more than 3. On all the other calendar apps you get a little plus button at the bottom... This one can fit a ton more, like 10 maybe. You can customize font size so you see more calendar data. Most legit calendar app.",1
"Great, great, great",1
I've been using this for several years and am most satisfied with it! Thanks for your great work!,1
Always been excellent -still is!,1
Love the calendar. Love the agenda's widget. Effortlessly share calendar with my wife. Easy to toggle views. This is a great app. And their support is great,1
Easy to use. Beautiful visuals Love having my lists and calendar all at hand in a widget on my phone. Have it across all my devices syncs really well.,1
Excellent,1
"Love this app. Has calendar, the calendar has repeat for regular appointments, a place for lists, and It syncs to all of my devices.",1
Awesome! I love how easy it is to use and make a beautiful planner,1
Great :),1
Why do we have to pay?,1
"I adore Artful Agenda! I've had it so long I don't know what I'd do without it! It keeps me all together, thank you so much for creating it! <3",1
Really loving this app. It's simple to use and I love that I can have it on all my devices and it syncs with no issues. It definitely helps me to stay organised. Plus I can make it look pretty with the stickers and covers and that makes creative me very happy too!,1
Hello Nice app. Is there a possibility to set my preferences as default settings for a reminder 3 days prior to deadline? I also need to copy tasks and amend only the description. Is there a possibility for doing this?,1
My desire is to see that my business career improve,1
Love it!,1
Love this calendar planner...so many ways to personalize and syncs with Google calendar. Won't go back to paper planner!,1
It helps me organize myself and create better time management,1
Loveeeeeee,1
"Never thought I'd pay money for something like this, but now that Im using it, it's worth it! I tried paper journals and could never stick with it as much as I wanted to. This is so much easier to be consistent with. I almost feel like I could be a more organized lesson one day! Support is fantastic too, I had questions and they were answered so fast!",1
It has everything i need in a planner. I looked and tried several before sticking with this one.,1
"I'm a big paper agenda lover, but wanted to try digital this year. I wont be going back because this app is amazing! I love that it 2 way syncs with my google calendar, and it syncs across my android AND iOS devices, and the web view is great. It has customizable planning areas (for lists) in day, week, and month views. Plus you can customize with stickers and covers. What's not to love?",1
"Calendars, Habits, and Lists, Oh My! The best digital planner used thus far. >5 calendars, task profiles, etc. Custom color coding per calendar. Solid note functionality. Is it free, no, and it shouldn't be. Is it affordable, yes, and worth it.",1
How did I survived before finding it? I am always raving about my Artful Agenda and always sharing with all other mom friends about it. I created a calendar color coded for each kid and now I can keep up with their school timelines and after school activities. Also going to school I'm able to track deadlines for each class. The best part is they keep releasing updates that users can enjoy. Will never go back to not having it. Keep my life in order and also gives me creative flexibility.,1
This app is so much fun it makes planning feel like a creative canvas.,1
This app is worth every penny. Easy to make awesome stuff!,1
"Easy, functional and gorgeous. Syncs with iOS, desktop windows + Android and iPhone. Everything you need in a software/ digital planner with no crazy add-ons for extra apps or note taking. Versatile, easy to configure, easy to read. No unnecessary bs. Gorgeous to look at. Don't bother with anything else!",1
Fantastic app,1
I absolutely LOVE this app! The look and feel of a paper planner with all the convenience of digital across all my devices. I couldn't be happier with this app!,1
"Overall, I like the app, especially the calendar color personalization and syncing. UPDATE: My concerns re: S-Pen were addressed with a suitable workaround using G-board. An issue regarding the widget was immediately corrected. The customer service is worth more than 5 stars! Looking forward to seeing continued updates and improvements.",1
"I'm in! Thank you Thank you Thank you! Only a week into the 2 week trial and I'm a fan! The checkmark feature alone is enough for me but the entire planner is such a streamlined experience. You've thought of almost everything. I do have a small wishlist for future features, but they will only enhance this product: -Full screen mode on website -Simple quick view for calender events instead opening to edit mode -Ability to use stickers in lists -Budget page option Thank you for this!",1
So far so good..but our daily task on the cLendar of ww click there it automatically fills our dots in the tracker ü•∞,1
Keeps me organized,1
"I'm relatively new to the digital world of planning. I was tired of carrying around a big book and having pages I would never use but still had to pay for. I looked at several digital planners, and most were way more than I needed (fluff). I love that Artful Agenda can be as much or as little as you want. It is so customizable and ever evolving and so affordable. Thank you!",1
Great app with great customer support. Love it!,1
I love the updates,1
"I am from South Africa and this planner is absolutely amazing, I love it.",1
It was great until it wasn't. It started having technical issues. I couldn't use the widget. It started to glitch and spasm. Had high hopes for this planner. I'm a little disappointed üòû . Update...I really like the app. They reach out to me and fix the bug. The app is working great!,1
Absolutely love it,1
Love it,1
"The app looks and feels great, but I can't justify spending that much money for a yearly subscription when it doesn't do EVERYTHING that I'd like it to do...like adding physical handwriting with my spen to a calendar date or event.",1
"I absolutely love this! it has really helped me plan my day and keep track of all the things I have to do. the calendar feature is very intuitive and helpful. *chefs kiss* i can't wait to see how this app continues to develop and improve! my only wish now, an option to expand notes or have the ability to add multiple note tabs per day.",1
Best of both a paper and digital planner! Exactly what I have been looking for!,1
It's awesome,1
Love this agenda app! Works great and they are always looking for ways to improve the program.,1
Love it! Love how it keeps everything connected even if I lost my phone and had to go to a different one. Never lost a beat with my calendar or plans that was saved!!!,1
I love that the list items move forward to the next day so I can constantly evolve my task lists. I like crossing things off. The habit tracker is a+ and now I can upload my own stickers! I added teddy bears today! 10/10 definitely recommend!,1
"Amazing app! I haven't been this excited about planners since I discovered HappyPlanner a few years ago. I love that there are digital stickers, and everything is so customizable. There are so many cool features, you can view the app on all devices, and you don't have to worry about figuring out where to store old physical planners. You can also reuse stickers over and over, unlike physical stickers where you have to buy new ones after you use them. Highly recommend.",1
"This app is amazing. If I can aside enough extra money, I'll definitely redownload it!",1
Love the app very easy to use.,1
"It's by far the BEST Calendar app in play store, highly customizable, always dependable and beautiful and fun to change colours on demand! Just luv it!!!;‚ù§Ô∏è",1
Good app. An helpful organizer,1
Very helpful and easy to use calendar. Good size and has the features I need.,1
Best full screen widget I've seen so far. Navigating time is easy. The only negative is inputting time slots are tedious,1
"Does everything I need without an problems. Gets Google calendar, outlook, and imports ICS without any problem. The widget gets its own page because I find it so useful.",1
"I've been using this app for 6 years or more, does everything I need in way better than the default on my phone?",1
Brilliant app,1
This is just what I was looking for my Galaxy 4 watch. The sync is instant and there are plenty of features and the calendar/task view is very functional.,1
"Had problems on Samsung Note 10 updating, I purchased the Pro along long time, it's favorite calendar on all my phones, but it stopped updating. Update, I uninstalled and re- installed working great as ever. Been the best since I bought it so so many years ago.",1
"I have used this app off and on for over a decade now, and it continues to be a calendar app that manages both my personal calendars and tasks. I like the ability to add a location to a task and the easy control of features in both the app and widget. I also use it on my wear os device and find it to be the best I have used. I do wish the wear os app integrated such that clicking on the date opens BC2 and not Samsung Calendar like Google Calendar does. Overall, I highly recommend this app!",1
Best calendar app for me,1
It is very easy-to-use and easy to modify.,1
Is this available for iPhone too?,1
Best of all,1
Great App!,1
"Great calendar app. Appointments, tasks, weather - call in one place, at a glance.",1
Still the best calendar app out there.,1
totally frozen today! can't even scroll,1
"Keeps me on point. Have had other calenders but this I like. I have used this for years, and this is my first review. So yes, I like this one.",1
I like the interface. And navigating has become much easier wth the new improvements.,1
It would still be nice if The widgets corresponded to the daytime/night time modes. Also please make a Apple version.,1
"Hi Developer, I've paid for the pro version in 2018, why do I still need to pay for it? Please leave contactable details to furnish my purchase proof of required. TQ.",1
Well done a spiffing app.,1
"I enjoy the layout. The only thing is the ads, of course.",1
"Great calendar app! I've used versions of this app for years to keep my jobs, appointments, events, and reminders recorded. Adding info to the events is easy. Color specification is an easy visual way to keep different types of events straight, an rearranging events is as easy as click, drag and release. It's been an inseparable party of my life for quite a while now.",1
Satisfaction,1
Excellent,1
"Good calendar app. Almost every feature is customizable, far more usable than the Google calendar app. I've used it for years and am very happy with it.",1
I love this app! PERIOD,1
Best one,1
Great App!,1
"Excellent app, does everything I would expect.",1
Best calendar app for my Android phone.,1
This is a fantastic calendar app. I highly recommend it!!,1
Great app. I am using the pro version. UPD: the issue was fixed.,1
One of the best apps ever. The developer thought about everything Thanks,1
"Love it, it easily integrates with Google, all my reminders, appointments, birthdays, holidays, event's etc all in one place",1
Best calendar app and made in Berlin. Using it for years!,1
"The calendar app is fantastic overall. However, it lacks a feature to mark events as completed once they're finished. While it does allow for events to be marked as canceled, having the ability to mark them as don",1
Still excellent app,1
"I'm 66 and am so thrilled - as soon as i took a couple of the numerous tutorials Business Calendar offers (free and very accessible) I quickly saw how clear and intuitive this app's design is! This confirmed what so many reviewers had said. I've been using it somewhat constantly for five weeks and i love it. The best calendar app out there, as many users agree. And when i have a question, the answer is found fast. Thank you!",1
"Good calendar program and daily task organizer, very useful!",1
"This app is MORE than just a calendar & functions very well as such. User friendly but like anything new that's as packed with features as this one, expect a little bit of a learning curve. After 2 years of use it still performs like a boss, stable & has great widgets! The development team is very fast to reply to inquiries & actively add new developments & improvements. Truly a must have app for all Droid users & worth every penny!",1
"Love it, work flow is quick, many ways to customize to fit your needs",1
Does exactly what I need a diary for,1
"Great product, keeps me organized, worth the money. I especially like how it integrates with my pixel watch.",1
Perfect App now that it has the outlook tasks sync. Kodus!,1
Love it,1
"Business Calendar is a time proof application. Versatile to adapt and change as your needs for organizing demand it. Intuitive. Easily synchronized to Google Calendar, while using my desktop computer. Has been my companion for years and, still going strong. No doubt about that.",1
Excellent diary app. No need to look anywhere else.,1
"Hi, I've been using this app now for several years. It has simplified my life. The copy paste feature of appointements is very useful and handy. I prefer to manage my google calendar, than the google webpage. My thanks to the dev team.",1
"I've been using it since 2015 and it has always performed well. My review was from 2021 and now in 2024 I am still thinking it's the best calendar app. Everything just makes sense, flexible in how it displays things, integrates well an no annoying pop ups that distract from what I'm trying to do.",1
One of my all time favourite apps synchronises with every OS and platform.... Perfect!,1
So far so good,1
I got the full version after paying a few dollars and it is my favorite calendar. Easy to add events and have reminders for my events.,1
Works well for me for various offices,1
Great app. Works well. Fairly versatile.,1
"Great app, awesome widgets. Developer is responsive to issues and concerns.",1
"Excellent app. Great calendar, tons of options, nice widget and sums perfectly with my account.",1
"Don't be fooled by the generic name, this is the best mobile calendar app on the play store. It's extremely customizable and has features like being able to drag and drop events and being able to multiselect events and move them all at once in case something comes up or a meeting runs long. It had lots of little quality of life features like a button to postpone tasks or events until Tomorrow if they are overdue. This app changed my mind about mobile calendars and how they're not all annoying.",1
Great app in all aspects,1
phenomenal,1
"Love this app! Super versatile... View by year, month, day schedule, daily agenda only. Syncs well with other calendars (Google and Microsoft). Can create own calendars and talk lists within, colour coding them with ample choice of colours. Task lists have super handy features. The only thing that would make this a perfect 5 star is if you could reassign tasks from one list to another. You can forward a list to another day (love this), but not one task to another list.",1
By far the BEST calendar on the Android market....PERIOD!,1
"""I use it every day. It keeps me organized."" (Written in 2022) And it is still being used to keep me making my daily commitments in 2024.",1
Very nice,1
"Great app, very functional and user friendly at the same time, good combo. The widget is what I use the most. Keep up the good work üëçüèª",1
Excellent calendar app. Recent update with Microsoft integration is so helpful. All the features I could ever hope for. Easy and efficient way to manage multiple calendars.,1
"Hilarious. After going back and forth with me in their review responses, about outlook calendars not working and how they couldn't do anything to fix it, THEY FIXED IT ü§£ü§£ü§£ top notch now",1
I use this app multiple times a day every day. So easy and intuitive to use to manage multiple calendars. Wish it was available on Windows.,1
Got what I was looking for.,1
I like this app.I can color my squelched differently,1
"Your application got me rid of procastinating (which I used to do ALOT) and life is more enjoyable, easy and less stressful now. It has everything I wanted and to my surprise it had more than I actually needed but can't do without. Once my phone or bank stops preventing me to use in-app purchases I'm definitely buying Premium, not for the features, but to support an awesome creator! Greetings from Calem :)",1
Verry good.,1
A brilliant app iv ever used! It has been 1 year using this app and I'm really happy about how it had changed my routine planning ways. I would like it more if the dev sets an icon search bar for the icons. It's really time consuming to look for the perfect icon in the icon window. Just a little feature to add and this would be the best planning app in the app store. :),1
"I have ADHD. This app has been so helpful! The little hits of dopamine from accomplishing tasks and earning points is exactly what my neurodivergent brain needs. It's cute, it's easy to use. I was able to input all my chores, even annual ones! And input habits I want to encourage or discourage like getting takeout versus eating at home. It glitched on me once. I just closed the app, reopened it, and it was fine! It's a free app! I plan to subscribe if this ADHDer still uses it in September. ;)",1
"Excellent app. I tried several schedule & checklist/ notes apps, and they failed to help me. My schedule isn't consistent enough to follow a set schedule, and the checklists just became mundane and overwhelming to the point of neglect. With this app I can set a few base habits I'm trying to form, a few things I need to accomplish daily, and set near future goals for task to complete, projects to begin, etc. The RPG aspect is motivating, along with quests, collectibles, a great community.",1
I really really love this app. It has great functions and task input possibilities. I love the health and coin reward system and that keeping up with your tasks allows your character to survive and will reward you with coins which you can program as irl rewards. Only two notes: the should be a vision board feature added or life goals seperate from the normal goals. Note two: if they had offered a one time cost to subscribe for life instead of monthly or yearly payments i would buy that.,1
"One of the first and remains one of the best. Turns your to-do list into an RPG. You earn items, pets, and customization options. It's fun to join friends in parties and attack bosses together, then dress yourself like a fish. Uses more negative reinforcement, which i don't care for, but there are ways to mitigate the effect because everything is so customizable. Endgame is frustrating because upward growth becomes stymied after a while, but character can be reset, and updates are constant.",1
"The best habit tracker I've ever used- and I've tried almost all the gamifiied versions. This is an all in one, and is FREE to use. There are no ads, no paywall to deal with, and there's a ton of incredible widgets and browser extensions to use as well. There's a reason why this rpg still leads the pack. The only time you would pay is if you'd want to support the team and unlock some extra (non-critical) features. And even the subscription ($5/month) is dirt cheap.",1
"Ive had this app before and it didnt really help me then, but I'm using it again with much better results already after just a few days. I normally don't write reviews, but when I started having issues from basically accidentally setting up two accounts, i ended up sending a bug report and got it all situated by the end of the day and without losing any of my progress. Super happy with the help i received on my issue and love the way the app is set up not only for convenience, but also for fun!",1
"Really needed a to-do app that not only motivated me to do every day tasks but also one that holds me accountable when I procrastinate and or do not do something. Although I'm not terribly interested in earning rewards, achievements, buying things, I can see how younger users would enjoy it. I also like that I can set due dates, reminders, and schedule tasks every day, every other day, once a week, etc. Its well thought out and easy to use.",1
"I've been using Habitica for years. It isn't perfect, but it is by far the best productivity app out there for gamers. The avatars are cute and the quests are entertaining and motivating, and these also don't distract from what's really important here: self-improvement. The only thing that could be better is the filter system, particularly when it comes to the to-do list. Using the tags can be tedious and confusing if you happen to have a lot of tasks with subtasks. Priority lists would be cool.",1
"Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed.",1
"I've had this app for almost 3 years and I can sincerely say that it's borderline perfection. You can customize it to your hearts content, the motivation potential is massive, a great example of this is my tasks to deal with projects, to-dos, learning, exercise, and so much more every single day. It's basically the only reason I'm even close to a high schooler/pseudo college student depending on the subject. Try it out for a few months, you'll get sucked into productivity like never before!",1
"Motivation is by far the hardest aspect to tackle when it come to these types of apps; especially when they're apps that you can shut down at a moment's notice.  This app however, brings out the best in you by rewarding you in points that you can use to buy inventory for your ""quests."" At first, I felt skeptical because I believed that I would waste all my time playing the rpg version of this game more than my tasks, but all was well when I figured out that the ""quests"" are actually completed behind the scenes and are only dictated by your ability to stay on track.  You control your character, without actually wasting time controlling it...brilliant!",1
"download this app If you're looking for the GAMING aspect of it, it's not super. But if you're looking for a task, habit, to-do list tracker with really good motivation tools and barely any ads, this is the best app ever. There's so many useful functions and yet it stays simple, casual, and easy to use + appealing to the eyes. You can make your own rewards and buy it for coins you earn by completing your tasks which is one of my favorite features. Best habit motivation on the app store rn.",1
"I've been using this app for over a year. It's a fun way to organise the things you want to do, and get them done. Gamifying tasks has been most fun with this app, compared to anything else I could find out there. You can group up with friends as well to defeat larger quests together. Definitely worth a try at the least. My biggest recommendation is to take a bit of time when you start out to really think of all of the big, and little things you really want to get done. Also, look up hard mode.",1
"This app is awesome for encouraging habits since it is satisfying to progress like a game. I love the pets we can get. If I could find a thing to improve, it would be adding an option for a separate to do list for ""today"" and ""later."" That way every morning, we can choose a few to-dos for today from our long list. Also, sometimes the app says I have no habits, dailies, to-dos, etc. when I open it, so I have to reopen the app to get them to show up.",1
"Very creative and useful app. It has a LOT of potential, but it needs a lot of work still. You should be able to scale tasks more dynamically, as huge tasks should give huge rewards but tiny tasks should give tiny rewards. One idea would be to allow users to select the scale of the task, from choices such as ""long-term,"" ""short-term"" and ""daily"" each with very different rewards.",1
"Great app that has helped me with lifestyle improvements. Extremely customizable - rather than forcing you into any particular format or reward structure, Habitica is mostly what you make of it. To me, this is its best quality. I love game design exercises, so the flexibility and open approach allow me to define my own terms and rewards for ""gamifying"" a daily/weekly routine. The routine itself becomes a fun creative problem to solve. It may not work for everyone, but it's exactly what I needed!",1
"So far, this is THEE best app to get me motivated to do things in real life. If you are easily overwhelmed by to do lists, goals, or bad habits, this app turns it into an interactive game so you feel good about getting stuff done. Much more fun than scribbling a checkmark on a paper. It breaks it down easily and makes boring life stuff a cute 8 bit game.",1
"i used to keep my to-do lists in my notes app like a little quest log and that was a nightmare. this app, if you're looking to gameify your productivity, is extremely cute, easy to use, and effective. it has a small community that's very helpful with a lot of info. you'll do things like break up projects into smaller goals or admit tasks are difficult so you can get more XP and feel like you're exploiting the developers. sike! you're just getting rewarded for building healthy habits, bozo!",1
"Wonderful app! It has helped me get on track with my personal goals. In such a fun way too! Suggestion from a really hooked new fan of this app... My work has me scheduled two different shifts throughout the week (morning or night), it would be cool if we could save the lists under categories so we can switch our goals easier as the days go. Since I switch shifts so often, it makes it harder to set times for my goals. Overall, love the app! Please consider my suggestion!",1
"This is a very unique and interesting game, and it's really been helping me keep schedule during quarantine, which is amazing and really makes me happy, but it only gets four stars because sometimes it doesn't keep content. I used a royal purple hatching potion on one of my tiger eggs (I had two) and both items disappeared from my inventory but I didn't get my tiger, which is really disheartening. Very willing to fix this review if it suddenly shows up, but I don't think it will :[edit-fixed!!",1
"Love this app. I think it is very useful and fun. Combining real-life, every day and long term tasks and goals with an RPG character leveling system of sorts. With a Habits, Dailies, and To Do tabs... I think if you are unmotivated this app could potentially help you also helpful for organization. I don't feel the ""pay to play"" that anyone is talking about. I don't think that is the main point of this app whatsoever. I use it very practically, anyway.",1
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well.",1
"I've been using this app for two semesters, and it's absolutely helped me stay organized and on track, especially in areas that I've struggled before. The reward system of earning XP and items that I'm familiar with in video games really helps keep me motivated as well. My grades have improved as a result, and I even use it for other errands and chores that used to slip my mind easily. The only issues I've had with it have been minor glitches. Definitely worth it! I love this app!",1
"pros: many. if you really struggle with self care or just need a place to put your to do list and get some virtual rewards, this is all for you. cute design, some features that allow some interaction with others but you curate your own experience. cons: some tiny bugs that occasionally pop up while trying to input new tasks, but any piece of tech will have bugs. these are annoying -- not experience-breaking",1
"Great way to keep track of everything you need to do, habits, daily goals. All in a gamified format with virtual rewards and punishments based on whether or not you complete the goals you have set for yourself. If you join a party, then your success is tied with others and your failures to. Which is added accountability. I highly recommend this app.",1
"its a good app, its free, it allows you to do as many habits as you want, it keeps track of your streek, you have the option of working alone, or join in a party, so you can go on quests together, witch holds you accountable. you can customize your character, and get armor, and animals to ride overtime, it has alot to offer compared to other apps, and its free. you cant really beat it. it been around for a long time, so its definitely well liked. its worth a look.",1
"I love this! Defeating Quest Monsters with my Party helps me look forward to checking things off my list. What I used to gripe about, I now do with less resistance, because this app helps me view life as a game. The themed chat groups are super supportive. There's a community to suit any style, and a variety of challenges to take part in on top of what you set for yourself. You can select the due date, how often the tasks repeats, timed task reminders, and the level of difficulty of each task.",1
"I have severe depression and anxiety from PTSD. It helps a lot to have a daily checklist, and this also helps me organize weekly chores and one-off tasks. I haven't explored much of the game aspect yet, but I love that there's a character to keep alive and healthy - just like I'm trying to do for myself. It's immediate feedback that I'm on track. I have hatched a few cool animals, but this app is a solid 5/5 just for the utility. Better than other schedulers/checklists that I've tried.",1
"The instant gratification of getting xp is super motivating, but more importantly, this is the only productivity app I've found that doesn't seem to be geared to people who work creatively full time or have a white collar job. It's super alienating to read about how an app will help me meet deadlines or check my email. Habitica isn't like that; it's for everyone.",1
"I've only just started up, but this app has progressed so much since I last saw it! UI is really tidy and easy to use. It doesn't feel like everything is locked behind a paywall (though I plan to support). Tasks/rewards/etc. are easy to customize, so the game can be tailored to exactly what you need. I have ADHD, so an app that makes every task a fun/novel experience is fantastic. I'm hoping this becomes a well worn tool in my belt. Thanks to the devs for creating such a useful resource ‚ù§",1
"Personally, I just needed a checklist to help me focus and remember things but when I found Habitica I was really intrigued. I highly recommend it to any folk that can't focus without exciting motivation or something to look forward to. Many options (habit tracker, daily tasks, a long-term to-do list) and helpful tools (optional notifications, due date, able to view completed to-dos, and MORE) all alongside a simple to understand layout. Perfect, with a cherry on top!",1
"It's a nice to do list app for me. Separating things into habits, dailies, and to do's isn't something I really thought about. So it's helped me plan what I want a bit better. I just wish there was a late night mode where it acts as if it's yesterday so you can accurately reminesce about what you did that day. I usually plan things out at night. Also turning a to do into a nice grocery list would be nice too. Trying to put it in the notes of a to do doesn't really work since you can't check.",1
"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc.",1
"Easy to use. Helpful community. A fun way to help with productivity and work on creating a new habit or breaking a bad habit. You definitely get out 9f what you put into it. Being gamified helps! Guilds, challenges, joining a party to battle bosses are fun ways to help one maintain focus and motivation. Of course you can choose to not use all that and still find the app helpful....granted it is geared toward gaming. Due dates on tasks are awesome. You pick the difficulty level of a task.",1
"I LOVE this app! Ever since I started using it, I've been getting a lot done lately. It's helping me to keep track of my tasks and my behavior. It's very customizable too! It's adorable, and you can personalize it to make it fit you the best! Even though it says it contains ads, I haven't seen one since installing! For an app that is run on such low (but wonderful) staff, the app is really good! It literally gamified my tasks, and I wouldn't get any other app to do so!",1
"Favorite app EVER, for 560+ days now. I use it daily, put all the to-do's and aspire-to-do's there and get a super satisfying burst of dopamine when I check them off and receive that sweet, sweet gold for gear and costumes. It WORKS - things I used to loathe doing (dishes, drinking water, read non-fiction books, learning instead of procrastinating) have become second nature! I'd still be addicted to Genshin or some other games if it weren't for Habitica. This app literally changed my life.",1
"I really like this app, it's very fun and helpful. Love that there's no ads. Wish there was a better way to organize tasks, but I think there's mods I can use to do that, I must go find them. The search option is broken but refreshing the app works. And the reminders don't go away if you do the task. But other than minor things. Thank you so much for making this, Habitica team. 10/10 highly recommend.",1
"I wanted to find a to-do list app that would give you a little ""celebration"" when you checked something off, for those times when it's hard to stay motivated. Habitica is that, plus so much more! It's fun to use, and can be as simple or as in-depth as you choose. It's a great way to stay organized, and to keep yourself from procrastinating too much. You can really tell that the developers enjoyed making the app, which adds to the charm.",1
"I deal with depression and anxiety which makes it difficult to sometimes even get out of bed and stay motivated to complete daily tasks. I'm a high school student with tons of work as well. This helps me keep track of, motivates me, and gives me a sense of accomplishment to keep me going. I have shared with app with friends, family, and even my therapist who encourages others to use it! Its easy to use and helpful to just about everyone! I definitely recommend this app!",1
"Love the app, but sometimes I wish there was more to do! I'm always wanting to hop on and do something on Habitca during free time, but there's not much to do. Maybe adding some minigames would be a fun idea?--Like a turn based rpg battle using your character. Maybe even other minigames, although none come to mind at the moment. Even if it had no effect on the rest of the app other than character exp or something, I think it'd be fun. Thanks for the great app devs!",1
"Really full-featured and continually-supported app. I just need to stick to it. I dropped it for a few months after I got a new phone and hesitated to download it again, largely because I wanted an app that had a dark mode and this never had that. But I decided to re-download it anyway, and it does indeed have a dark mode now. I would suggest the developer add new pictures on the Play Store to acknowledge this!",1
"Really, really good. I've been struggling with awful executive dysfunction lately but getting the little dopamine spikes checking off all my boxes on this app has already within a few days helped me not miss a single thing since I downloaded it. Highly recommend! It doesn't bother you with the premium version and doesn't seem to lock any features behind it besides some cosmetics and such",1
"It has a lot of great features! I love the fact that it has an acutal character for you to develop alongside you and quests, it would be cool if they made it a little pixel idle game. However, I wish it did have a changeable widget theme so I could make it match my background and unlike RPG To do List after checking off your to do list it doesn't show a little pop up and give you a fun triumph noise, but that's just me.",1
"I have extremely bad depression and often struggle to even get out of bed some days. I forget to eat meals, and there are very few times when I have energy. This app I think may actually change my life. Having rewards for doing tasks is something that I love having, even if it's as small as a 10 minute break. There are so many amazing features in this, and I truly belive that the devs have something here. I will be using this daily.",1
"One of the best habit apps. I had it a lot longer then any other mental health app on this phone before. Its engaging, encouraging, and motivating to do. It's fun! It's amazing! (I un-downloaded it because I'm super bad at focusing and attendance, so i often forgot about the game. But if I was able to keep attending i definitely would get it again)",1
"I went a year without in-home internet and this app was my only connection to Habitica for that year. I wouldn't recommend using the app exclusively because the desktop version is so much more developed. Now that I have in-home internet again, I primarily use the desktop version. I use the app when on the run and it's great for filling in the gaps when I'm not at the computer.",1
"It's cute, easy to use, and is great for helping you keep track of everything. If you have the creativity for it, you can turn even the most mundane of tasks into an epic quest. It also lets you choose the difficulty level of each task, which I greatly appreciate. You get rewards and experience for completing things and your hero is customizable as well. Essentially you can turn your life into an epic RPG if you want to. The only limits are your creativity.",1
"Didn't expect this to be as handy and motivating as it is- it's great for errands and reminders as well as chores. It does freeze up if it's been sitting open or if I clicked into another app (say, to make a phone call), which is annoying, but closing and re-opening the app fixes it. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a little extra encouragement to get things done, including things you might be a little anxious about (like phone calls).",1
This app has given me the boost to my drive allowing me to complete a lot more. There's a few minor quality of life changes that could make it better like: adding different color tabs for each task based on it's difficulty (i.e. trivial=yellow; easy=orange; etc.). Hope to see this app grow and reach more people the way it's reached me and my friends.,1
"I really love this app - I've been doing it off and on for years and it's just always fun, interesting, really well set up, the in-game items and quests make it so much more fun and rewarding to do real life tasks and chores, and the app doesnt hound you constantly like some other apps (but it can if you want it to). Overall it will always be my go to favorite Todo and checklist app",1
"This app is so cute and fun. You can make as many or as few daily checklist items, habits, goals, etc. As you work through your lists, you get loot and level up. It really is like managing yourself as a D&D player character. The instructions are a little sparse regarding how to work with eggs and creatures etc, but not going on quests doesn't prevent you from your daily stuff, so it truly is optional.",1
"This is so much fun! I never been so addict to do things productive in my life! I wish you can join more than one party; Like have a party with your friends and one for your family. The Avatars are also a bit weird looking and can use more refinement. I have seen better retro avatars before like pokemon or link, but he bosses look fanatstic along with the pets. Also I wish the pet add some kind of benefit to the game.",1
"I love this app and I use it daily but it's giving me trouble. When I open it, yesterday's tasks do not appear so I can start a new day -- I sit and wait but they won't pop up, and when I try to check off a task it makes the ding sound but nothing happens on the screen, it's just stuck. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the app cache. Solution? Thx. Edit: it seems to be up & working again -- thanks for the response :)",1
"Amazing. Not only is this app cute-to-boot, but it's so easy to use! It doesn't largely focus on the character aspect, which I like because I'm mostly here to organize my life. Everything is covered: To-Do lists, Dailies, Scheduling; its so extremely customizable and in such a simple platform (that I dont have to pay extra for) Not only that, there is the community aspect! Its about holding yourself accountable, and this app is perfect, thank you.",1
"The basic functionality is straightforward, and for someone with ADHD the gamification of my daily tasks has helped me be on track a lot better. The more complex functionality of the 'game' is only unlocked after you get further along in your progress. That seems to be a very good choice so new users can focus on building out their daily tasks and habit tracking. I heard about the app in passing on the Writing Excuses podcast and just a few days in I am hooked in a good way.",1
"Very good overall but I'd still like to see some improvements. It would be nice if you could get notifications for 5000+ member guilds, I wish you could more easily sort through challenges and leave ones that have ended (and delete tasks from expired challenges), and have the app automatically delete to-dos once you've completed them so you don't see old completed ones in the task list. Having more options for equipment to wear would also be appreciated.",1
I absolutely ADORE Habitica! It's changed my life - it's the perfect goal setting app! It keeps me motivated without making me feel overwhelmed. It's the perfect amount of detail and convenience without getting too complicated. Would LOVE to see a children's chore app from the same people - I've tried 3 and none of them even come close to being as helpful as Habitica is for me. Thanks guys!,1
"If you struggle with tasks or starting/breaking habits, seriously get this app! It'll change your life! I thought to myself ""no way am I falling for this gimmick"" but here I am, being productive as hell everyday and actually keeping up with healthy habits I've wanted to do for months now. I have adult ADHD so it keeps my attention, I barely have to set a reminder to check my lists throughout the day (I have reminders for everything) give it a try, once you get used to it, you won't want to stop",1
"As someone who gets ADHD paralysis, this app really helps me get up + know what I have to do throughout the day. It's split up into 3 categories with neverending checklists: ‚úîÔ∏èHabits, ‚úîÔ∏èTo-Dos, & ‚úîÔ∏èDailies. Write down a task, check it off. For me, staying organized is crucial. With this app, I am able to write everything down, break down tasks, designate project time, schedule rewards, etc. The game aspect of this app is just an added bonus to me. It's retro & kind of nerdy, just like me.",1
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. ü§ì",1
"I've used this app for a long long time. Even without the game mechanics, as a task list and habit builder, it is unparalleled. Add in tight communities and an infinite number of challenges to pick from, many many different play style and motivation schemes and you have an impressive tool for life. I like to use it to curb impulse spending. If I want to buy something, I put it on my rewards, and then complete my tasks and dailys until I can afford my desires through productivity.",1
"I'm new to the app but I already love it. I was looking for an app that would help keep me on task and help me to work towards important goals. This app has so many amazing features! I've tried a few other video game-esque routine apps, so I'm certain that this one is the best. There are habits like eating healthy or going out for a walk, daily goals like taking a shower or finishing your homework, and big-picture to do lists. The best thing about these features is that they can be customized.",1
"I really love the app, it's helped so much with my procrastination, especially on big projects. It's helping me to be more mindful about some bad habits and gradually making them weaker as well! However, I think that it's kinda annoying that some of my challenge related tasks turn bright red for not doing them... They're the feedback type that's due at the end of the month, so yes, I can't do them before hand.",1
"I found myself writing to do lists all over my arm and on random paper, very disorganized and hard to keep up with. It was stressful and a lot of times i didnt feel like i did everything i needed to. This app is awesome cause now all my random to dos can be in one place AND organized into categories. Super helpful to ocd and keeping track of those long term projects. as an artist i have a lot of projects going all at once and i havent forgotten a project since downloading this app! 10/10",1
"This app has lots of great things and options. It gives you a great sense of progress, by making you see how your character grows, and all options are free to use, expect by the customizations of your character which you have to earn. I really recommend this app, if you have a lots of habits or list of things you want to accomplish, the only downside is that it may have so many options that it can overwhelm you.",1
"Gameifying my tasks really boosted my productivity- as someone who struggles with depression, things as simple as getting out of the morning and brushing my teeth feels like too much somedays. Making it a game to look forward to has helped me form better habits already- I'm finally even putting my keys in the right spot! I like that I can set up any tasks difficulty, because I can weigh it by mental effort rather than physical. I can reward myself for ""basic"" tasks that usually feel impossible!",1
"This is the only task/habit app that I've used for more than 2 days in a row. Its super cute, I love the RPG social aspect of it. It's definitely kept me motivated and I'm excited to see my future progress. My only issue is that sometimes it's hard for me to tell when I've done something in the habits section (since there's only positive/negative and I set it for weekly/monthly reset).",1
"I'm glad I tried this, but since the last update it won't work properly. It often won't update with tasks I mark completed and this morning, it won't register the new day and refresh my dailies.",1
I have been waiting forever,1
"please , PLEASE improve your widgets. They have potential, they could be more convenient PLEASE MAKE THEM MORE CUSTOMIZABLE, INTERACTIVE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME I'm too lazy for opening the actual program. all I want is checklist on my homepage pleaseee I want to use this cute program just do thissss",1
"Great App with an amazing idea, only improvement it needs is to add a search option for challenges",1
good app But it needs improvement in completing tasks in offline mode I hope to improve the offline mode more,1
"It's good, totally. But it would be better if I could undo a ""To Do"" because I just accidentally pressed it to be completed. And also, it would be nicer if I could look at my previous ""To Do"" things in the app.",1
Love the app..But subtasks gives no exp please fix..,1
"I love it. The only issue I have is that it won't allow me to make a challenge for my party. I bought diamonds for rewards, but I have tried 4 times. It doesn't take the diamonds, so I guess it can't be a glitch. Maybe it is because we are doing a quest? It doesn't say. Oh and it does say Server lost sometimes but I still ha e connection.. Other than that, I just wish there were other options for the rewards that could be used in the game. Ones the player can create.",1
Makes doing the boring chores of adulting more fun,1
best app in the store please add pomodoro timer woth setting This will be very useful,1
"It works, I just didn't like that I wasn't getting notifications as often as I like.",1
"It's a good app, but I am just looking for something else.",1
"All's good, except the reminder feature doesn't seem to be working for me.",1
I hate how you can only get gems behind a pay wall because paying for gems defeats the purpose of the rewards you get from habits,1
A little more pet management but overall a very good app,1
"Tasks, habbitst etc. doesn't sync with Smartwatch.",1
"Only started using this app yesterday, but the Wear OS Experience does need improvement, especially on the aspect of that it could use a Watch Face, as well as being able to complete checklist items on my tasks.",1
I enjoy it so far. One of the things I'd change would so Habits could have reminders. And maybe a better tutorial for how to use Parties..,1
"PLEASE for the love of god, add a weekly/monthly visual on habit/daily tracking. This app would be perfect ü•≤",1
"Just downloaded it, enjoying it so far,I guess it would be more helpful for me if a new kind of tasks is added where you note the progress (something like a percentage) in a time consuming task or a complicated one, hope it will be added soon",1
"Absolutely Wonderful. Super customizable, you can really tweak it to work in whatever way motivates you best. I'd give 5 stars if you could NAME the PETS and if it had a more consistent connection to the server.",1
"Hey, new user here, I find the app pretty cool but there is one thing that I noticed. Not sure if this is my mistake or a ""bug"", but I have some weakly habits, and for those habits I have a reminder that will go of, for example, at 19:30. The issue is, the weakly habit os only set up for Wednesday at 19:30 but the reminder goes of at every day of the week. Is this a known issue? Have I created the habit wrongly?",1
"I use this everyday. It's buggy but in a kind of begrudgingly loveable way? Hoping it sees updates eventually but this has really actually stuck with me and enabled me to change my life. Remember that change starts with you, and not an app!",1
Really great app to keep you on schedule. I do wish that more of the pets and items were available without buying gems though.,1
I like that instead of tracking myself like a well performing business model I'm just levelling up a little guy. my critique would be that the app has quite a lot of features so gets a bit confusing but I love it for the most part,1
"would rate 5 if you could name the pets, PLEASE let me name them",1
"Helps me remember to complete my daily tasks, but the rewards don't really do it for me. The dopamine hit comes entirely from checking off the lists.",1
"This is a fun app that is best used with a group of friends for casual habit taking. It does lack proper statistics and analytical features, though. Beyond a basic streak counter for every habit and basic goal functionality, it doesn't have much in terms of insights. No estimations, time-tracking, rolling period goals, etc. It's more of a commitment-contact-type game than a tool",1
Great app! would be 5 stars if it was still free.like it used to be but you lose a star for me for micro transactions ‚òπÔ∏è,1
I love the concept and use. The customization and avatar application could use a bit of work though.,1
"great app but doesn't send notifications at all, pls work on this and the offline mode",1
"Only negative, the chat feature is not ideal. Though least important feature. Other than that, amazing, 10/10. Goal setting is easy, separating your to dos on their corresponding category is super useful. Also, love how it treats you like a responsible adult, you can cheat very easily, but in the end that's not going to help you. PS I have a Huawei phone. And the fact that it connects to the internet instead of Google play, makes it easy to keep me connected. For me, most important. Thank you!",1
Fun and helps me get my tasks done :3,1
"User of two years here. I have ADHD and this app helped me change my life. Very cute art and constant variety. Setting alarms for my tasks allows me to offload them for my brain and checking them off once I complete them helps me feel more accomplished and gives me closure, both helpful for sleeping through the night. My girlfriend and I love the shared quest feature. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",1
Habitica has absolutely changed the way I approach my day to day life. I'm terrible at remembering to do things so having a daily list to check off is a lifesaver. Also all those things you become blind to around the house can be added as tasks to do when you feel like it. Then add in the companionship of parties and it's just fantastic all around.,1
"This is one of the most positively life-changing apps I've ever discovered. I've been using it for over a year, & it's the reason I've actually developed and stayed consistent with the habits I ought to be doing. I'm not internally motivated, so watching my cute little pixilated avatar ""grow"" and acquire costumes, weaponry, and pets as rewards for me completing my real-life tasks is--weirdly--very motivating for me to actually be productive in real-life.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! It's perfect for ADHD people who love to gamify tasks, habits, and to do lists! I don't have anyone to help me with quests and haven't joined a guild in the few years I've been using this app, and I still have fun! So if you feel more comfortable running solo, rest assured you can and still make progress with the app.",1
"It is incredibly difficult to earn gems without paying money, but it makes sense when considering the small size of the Habitica team and model for operation. It's not impossible, though, so patience and perseverance pay off! Habitica has helped me a bunch in the short time that I've been using it so far. I've been doing so much better with many things! It's also fun, and addictive enough to really motivate me to good habits. Thank you, Habitica team!",1
"I've been using this app for years at this point. Great way to keep track of daily tasks, habits, and to do lists with the added bonus of gamifying it! The gaming aspect of it could be better but I also only have the free version. Plus, if it was too distracting it would become a hinderance to my productivity! Which, I think, would be counterproductive to the apps purpose. 5 Stars!",1
"Honestly, this app is amazing. I was struggling to keep track of tasks and stay motivated in doing online courses, but I've been doing great since picking up Habitica. I strongly recommend for anyone struggling to remember or find reasons to do something consistently. Levelling up my character, doing quests, and finding items is so incredibly satisfying, and the whole app is free! It has a subscription model, but it's for unlocking cosmetic items only and doesn't change core gameplay. 10/10!!",1
"Habits and dailies are confusing, because sometimes it's green even i haven't done the task today. So i forget a lot if i actually done the task yet or not. I switched to To-Do instead, although it's a bit annoying since i have to keep adding new one after i tick the task.",1
Thanks to Thomas Frank for introducing me to this app. It's amazing but can still have a few imporovements.,1
Nice work,1
"It seemed really helpful, and getting all of my daily tasks done is so much easier when motivated. It's super fun and easy to understand. The only problem I have is I can't use it, because I don't have Internet at home where I'm trying to get these things done... Seems kind of silly that I can't complete a task offline. If y'all made checking off tasks available while offline I would totally come back, but as it is, it's usefully nonuseful.",1
"I rate it 4.5/5.0 for the UI,, has the smoothest gamify interface. Has community among user for goals inside the app. A little bit confused how the reset by the end of the day works. I also don't know how to raise it's character beside completing task. I'm giving it a 3 star personally because I cannot maximize all the features it has.",1
"An amazing experience for the first 50 ish levels. Absolutely recommend, even though they deleted guilds. It's just that it becomes stale after you max out your stats and there's little else to accomplish",1
"It's a really good app, helped me to start being consistent with my habits. The idea of losing health if you don't do them really feels like video-game dailies xD but I'd say the past month or two, there's been connectivity problems on the app. Server connection lost, or things not syncing properly. Just experienced it again today. But aside from that, the segregation of habits, dailies, and tasks is pretty unique and once you get the hang of it, it's absolutely worth it.",1
Found this little gem after a long search and it's perfect. Easy to setup and understand. Love the lvl up and character creation. Makes it feel like a real gaming experience while actually getting things done. Now I feel like I get credit for all the cleaning I do and other dad/husband responsibilities. I love the habits tracker. I have a bad habit of eating junk food and I lose health for it. It's hilarious and a good way to refrain from making it a bad habit. Great application!,1
"Lag and server connection issues, but otherwise it's a really, really, really good app.",1
"Awesome concept, definitely a game changer for those with ADHD, but this app needs serious cleaning up. There are a lot of bugs to fix, and the app can be very slow at times. But once those issues get fixed, this will be no doubt a game changer for those struggling with ADHD or motivation in general.",1
"Lovely app! just wish there wasn't a need for subscription to get diamonds etc... but it's alright, I get it... the developers need their money too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
"Great app, though, I think it'd be way better if it had a timetable with a calendar to see how much you did each day.",1
"This app is quite nice! However it still has some bugs that need to be patched. Like for example, head gear becomes inverted in dark mode (except when it doesn't). Also I love the fact that this is open source :p",1
a perfect app for me if it weren't for the fact that the server is unresponsive. Please fix,1
"This really helps our ADHD asses focus. It's just so much fun! We would pay for this app if their was a 'household' mode. Something like the party but with shared Daily and Todo lists. Maybe with an easy shortxut to share them from your personal list. Something like 'feed the dog' is sometimes done by me, sometimes by the partner. It would also make sure we don't feed them twice :D Edit: I'm also missing an option for no counter reset, seems like an easy addition.",1
"Most problems are solved, but it would be better if you added calendar for dailies or filters by days to see what i have to do tomorrow.",1
Good for habit tracking but doesn't gamify the habits enough. Wish there was an actual rpg or something that you could use your character within. It would add to the accountability and add incentives.,1
üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò,1
"Great app, but it would be much better if the app could display on statistics more detail on each daily and habits.",1
This is a very good app for tracking your habits and tasks. But it would have been great if there was a schedule end date as well while scheduling tasks. So giving one star less.,1
"Easy to get started, although there is a lot you can navigate around and not all my questions were available with answers in the help section.",1
Pretty good worth a try,1
"It's very slow, if it wasn't as slow it'd be a 5",1
"It's an amazing app to have with a very supportive community. However the lagging is a big drawback. Widgets are not working properly, screen and party chat are not refreshed immediately. If these improvements are made, then there is no doubt in my mind that this will be one of the best self help apps out there.",1
some glitches need fixing,1
"This app has helped me so much with changing bad habits and streamlining a routine. I downloaded it last year and wish I had known about it earlier! I am reaching goals I didn't think possible with the daily habits I've set up for myself. I am becoming more productive with my to list. I used to spend so many hours building virtual worlds on various games, but now I can improve my own personal life while having a little fun. Highly recommend!!",1
"As someone who really struggles functioning, I think it's really beautiful and amazing that someone would go out of their way to make this app. I just opened it up and setup for using it, and I already know it's going to be extremely helpful and fun. I've been using all kinds of different counter and planning apps simultaneously to try to function, but this puts it all together in an artsy way that feels low pressure. Awesome job!",1
helps keep me on track.,1
This is the habit tracker I've been looking for my whole life.. absolutely genius app!,1
good appp,1
good to build habits and keep consistent,1
definitely keeps good habits. don't use it for bad habits though so can't say the effectiveness of that part,1
its great,1
has been really helpful but I do feel a bit bad if I forget to get on but it's an awesome app,1
looks gud,1
This app is turning my life around. Thank you so much!,1
I have ADHD and this app helped me get that dopamine running for tedious tasks. It helped me stay on top of hygiene in some of my low spots. It's super fun and I enjoy the layout and how you add your habits and to-dos into it. It even color codes if you missed days to yellow and red. The avatar is cute and pixelated and I love the pets and mounts. The quests are super fun and habit related puns galore.,1
has a wheelchair add on. disability is partially represented!,1
love it! doesn't cost much money,1
Used to have some bad habits but 90% are now gone,1
such a great app,1
I recently discovered this app i was using todolist from all these days.. this app seems way better and nice i really like that it makes your life in a game but one small thing which i wish was there was the ability to add tasks when your not connected to the internet. I understand you need internet to modify your character and all that but if possible can you make the tasks part of the app offline ?,1
good,1
Well done. Great job. üôè,1
YASIR RUNKA,1
I love it. I want to keep on using it.,1
Just amazing how customizable and unique it is.,1
Good,1
"just trying this out.....having had it for a few days getting the hang of things. Joined a group, completed a task and hatched some pets...feels like I'm making progress.",1
"Please, add the daily journal feature.",1
is good,1
good app,1
God bless you,1
"just think that u actually have the access to know how much you are improving in your life ,how much you are evolving...this app makes it real",1
Awesomecapplicatio,1
I have autism and it's helped me get my tasks done for chores. And my self care. Do use it.,1
"I miss having guilds but, this is still the best motivation/task management app around!",1
good app. highly recomended.,1
"great tool for encouraging you to stay on track and on task. small learning curve, but meant to be fun! and it works, I've used it of and on for years...",1
"I don't usually write app reviews, but I recommend this app for those who find it difficult to stick to traditional to-do lists due to distractions or if you have ADHD. Although there is a subscription fee, the subscription provides only in-game items such as equipment, pets, and gems to enhance your experience.",1
"-1 It's messed up that we have to buy the app again if we switch from iphone to Android and vice-versa. Especially since after I purchase the app, you can just sync the previous account. If you can sync the previous account anyway, why not just do that from the start instead of making us pay for it twice? It's upsetting. However, I do love the concept of the app, so it still gets a 4. I hope others are aware, though, before they make the purchase.",1
"Amazing experience, love how rather than setting limits for time spent on a device, it helps with self regulation by incentivizing time spent OFF said device. Being able to make app exceptions and keep track of what different focus times are for is super helpful. The planting reminder doesn't work though, and that's upsetting because sometimes I need to be reminded that I have this app in order to remember to use it.",1
"I really love this app! It's very cute and simple and let's me stay focused while I study. However, the one thing I really don't like about it is that, while it let's me open certain apps, I can't choose what apps I want to be allowed to open or not. For example, I listen to Spotify while I study because music helps me focus. But I can't open Spotify, even though I can open apps like Google play or SMS or whatever. If the developers would allow either Spotify to be in use while I use the app or if we can choose what apps to block, it would be greatly appreciated by me!",1
"I've been using this app for a couple of years now. I think it's for specific kind a people. If you like setting timers for yourself, you should try it out! I like to assign certain trees to a category so when I look at my forest I can have a quick idea of how I've spent my time. For developer: I used to be able to see the active timer in my notifications but now I can't, is there any way to fix this? Sometimes I have to use different apps for my task and I want to see the time in notifications",1
"This really helps me get through my work. I have a problem trying to pick up my phone and scroll TikTok when I need to be working, but by putting something at stake this helps a ton. Plus, you get to see outcomes from your efforts and some interesting stats. Only reason I didn't rate it five stars is I sometimes have trouble activating the timer in the first place, but that's a me problem more than a you problem.",1
"This is a great app so far, but I do wish there was a timer for helping you focus on other things on your phone. What I mean is, I know the whole point is to get you off your phone and help you be more productive, but I only really would need an app like this to help me focus on art cause I get distracted a lot, and my art program happens to be on my phone so I can't plant a tree and then just go to it. Otherwise, it's a cool app and works well for me, just a suggestion :)",1
"Very useful app that has been great at helping me focus at work and break the habit of grabbing my phone every five minutes. But even though I have Google Podcasts on my allowed apps list, I can't open it when in deep focus mode. It's really frustrating because if I need to change my podcast episode or if I forget to play it before starting my timer, I either have to work in silence or give up just so I can start up my podcast. Aside from that it's a 5/5 app in my opinion.",1
"The concept for this app is really cool and I am definitely more productive when using the app. It has decreased my phone usage by a lot. However, the biggest problem I have with it is that almost everything is locked behind a pay wall. Features behind the paywall are: achievements, friends, most analytics of your focus time, creating custom tags so you can accurately categorize your time focused, and the majority of the plants that you unlock with coins, and signing up for an account.",1
"this app is dynamic and easy to use. it helps track my schedules and, most importantly, helps me reinforce strong habits and discipline. have used it daily for 3 years and will continue to use it for many years to come.",1
It really helps with focus with visible rewards.,1
That's the best way I ever seen to create habits!,1
it's fun,1
Near,1
Free and Awesome!,1
A+ for the effort,1
The best idea for an app,1
habitica gives me a way to have fun with my habits üòÅ,1
Works for me. ymmv,1
Tbh it's good but i find this app hard to use like I don't understand some things in it,1
good,1
üòÅü§üüèΩ,1
love the app! it feels great to get so much done and keep my tasks organized! plus I get to gain in game experience for my real world tasks!,1
"THE BEST SELF CARE APP I'VE EVER SEEN, its better than any others I've tried out, the thing I love the most about it is that it's kinda like Duolingo the language learning app, it built like a game. The second thing I love about it is that it doesn't shove subscriptions in your face from the first time you open the app",1
ok,1
"I use it all of the time! I miss the guilds a little bit, some had made games that intertwined with challenges. Thankfully, they didn't remove the challenges themselves. Would love to see Guilds back at some point!",1
it's good,1
It is an awesome app for anyone looking to be productive,1
Very cool! Easy and simple interface which is what I want from a habit app. I do have 1 request - can you make a better widget for the +/- habits? I would love a bigger one (not just the single item ones) like the 'dailys' widget - which I easily use daily!,1
"Such a fun way to find motivation, solid 10/10",1
Great App! I've been using it with my sister and nephew for a couple of months and we share battles to be more efficient in our dailies. :) just love everything in it!,1
Very productive app :),1
This is an amazing app that really helps me be motivated. I'm a level twelve Rouge and I've only had it for thirteen days. I love all of the pets and armor and weapons. I also like the quests. My partys doing the vices shade right now. (Part One). I also really like the tasks. I love that you get item drops and you don't have to buy everything. Otherwise it would take a while to get a pet. Download this awesome app!,1
"just starting now, I hope it's awesome",1
"life-changing, highly recommend it",1
so far so good,1
best,1
"This app is great and efficient the way it motivates you to do all your tasks, it makes everything you do enjoyable and manageable",1
"This app is awesome! I didn't know exactly what to expect when I downloaded it, but it is the best productivity tracker for me. I love the cute items you get to collect, RPG aspect of the, honestly I love everything about this app. The app helps me stay motivated and connects you to a community of others who are more productive. I love this because it helps me hold myself more accountable. I also really like that the app is not pushy with sales or flooded with adds. 10/10 would recommend üëå",1
Perfect app to feel motivated in doing daily life tasks and tasks of self improvement,1
"Such a fun way to better yourself. If you like video games, and you like being a better person, this app marries the two together. There is a ton that is included free so you don't necessarily have to get the subscription to make meaningful changes in your life. But when I can save up more money after I finish school, I will probably do the annual subscription. It is a great way to hold yourself accountable with regards to holy Scripture reading, prayer, working out, and school work",1
I love this app,1
"I have been using Habatica for 4 yrs now. This is the only thing that I've ever used that has keep me working out, eating well, meditating, etc. I finally feel like the characters I've always admired. Admittedly, I don't participate in the Quests, but use my coins to ""buy"" real life rewards (i.e. TV night, junk food, social media break etc). It has worked wonders for me, and it's fun to see my virtual self leveling up.",1
"I've been using this for about a year and a half and it has helped me hold my life together. It really does help you build habits, you just have to find out what works for you and sometimes switch things up a bit, because there are many ways of going about it. Challenges are very helpful, guilds are a great place to find like-minded people with similar goals and interests, quests done in parties are motivating, and drops like pets and gear are fun. And most importantly, it's doable!",1
"I love Habitica! I am subscribed and backed the pin kickstarter too. I love games where you collect things, so I collect the pets, outfits, and hatching potions through completing my tasks. I also am motivated to do my tasks by the threat that my party might die if I miss too many. I am also extremely happy that there is a way to get almost all of the limited items you missed out on!! My only wish is for more strategy with fighting bosses and the different classes. That would make it perfect :)",1
"I really like the concept. It's presented in a way that allows things that you may not want to do feel a little bit more like an activity than a burden upon your shoulders. It's also really good to have a visual representation of what you've accomplished to give you a better sense of ""Wow. I DID that"". The only thing I can think to change as of writing this is that it's a little annoying that you can't search for a specific challenge you might want to do. Good, fun, and easy to use. I recommend.",1
"This app has been such a game changer for me! I was dealing with some executive functioning difficulties, and stumbled across this app looking for tools to deal with that. It gives me one place to put all of my to-do list, and all those little nagging thoughts of ""Don't forget XYZ"". Now I can just throw it in the app and I know I won't forget it! I also really love the social element, it's fun to do it with your friends! I'm looking forward to watching this app grow!",1
"Let's be honest, when I write ""To Do"" lists on paper, everything is ALWAYS a jumbled mess with notes EVERYWHERE. And then suddenly my notebook isn't big enough, but I don't want to spend money on more...  Enter the whiteboard. It's big. Really big. But it's still the same issue because there are notes scribbled in margins and around the few pictures hung up.   Everything still  S U C K S.  One night in a dark alley under the only streetlight appeared Habitica. ""Use me,"" It whispered. So I did. and let me tell you everything is GLORIOUS! Tasks are way more organized on here than I would ever be capable of alone! Also the bonus of playing an RPG with friends is a major plus!! Amazing app, 10/10.",1
"Awesome app. Great for staying productive and getting things done. I have one suggestion for the developers though, in the party chat, when people cast skills for the party, it tends to block up the chat and interrupt conversation. It would be nice to have a different section where it shows when party members use their skills. This also leads to chats being deleted faster. Anyway, just a suggestion. I appreciate the app and it being free. It has been good for me. Thank you for your time.",1
"I been getting into this app since a few days ago and I already love this app!! It gives me the greatest motivation to do even the smallest things I tend to laze out so easily without being bored. I tried out a couple of similar apps but they are nothing compared to Habitica, the difference? New constant content always since years ago and ways to make your work rewarding. Hands down the most motivating, funnest, useful game to make you a better person!",1
"I was skeptical at first, but this app has proved a lot more useful than I thought it would be. The best feature is how it simultaneously allows for customization and depth of content. There are various features that you are free to use as little or as much as you want to, depending on your needs. This makes for a fun, challenging, yet also low-pressure environment to give you a boost on improving your lifestyle. The app works for you rather than you working for the app, empowering you to grow.",1
"If you like games with rewards and statistics and you want to improve being on top of your habits and tasks, this is definitely the app for you. It has an extensive wiki to tell you all about how it works. I enjoy the social tools (use with discretion). And, wonderfully, there are No Ads. If you want to pay some money, you can get extra perks.",1
Absolutely love this app! I was having a hard time with it because I work late and it would throw off the days but you can go into settings and pick your end time for the day. So I can end the day at 2am! My friends also use this app and it's so nice to do it together! This helps me with my executive disfunction and I use the to do list portion to keep track of things that don't need to be done immediately. I also use it to make sure I do things I enjoy doing and not just chores.,1
Very impressive habit tracking app. I've played with quite a bit with habit tracker apps and daily planner apps and habitica does it the best. And at $0 cost too! Takes a while to set up but once everything is in place I found this to indeed improve my daily productivity. I would say only improvement would be to make option to organize and label reminders in Dailies.,1
"Fun and motivating. suggestions for future updates: the to do list should be more customizable. You should be able to organize tasks by days without entering a due date & you Should be able to filter completed tasks by date (I love seeing everything crossed off at the end of the day). 2, I wish there was a way to enter tasks for total # of times in a week vs specific days. Ie I want to do yoga 3x/wk but not necessarily every other day.",1
"It's a fun way to get a family or group of friends to work together to better themselves. Set daily tasks, habits you want to form, to do lists, and level up your adventurer. There's the option to pay for items that can make your game move faster, but if you remember your goal for self improvement should be a marathon instead of a sprint, it's easier to take your time and enjoy the grind.",1
"What an absolute boon. My boyfriend has ADHD and a love for video games--this app helps him remember and complete tasks much more easily than unengaging notes-app checklists. It really does wonders for motivation. Habitica is helping me survive grad school AND manage the mental load of day to day activities. I'm really excited for the new ""groups"" feature to be rolled out as well. Thank you so much Habitica!",1
"This is an extremely helpful app. Without having to pay for anything, you still get so much out of it. My entire family is using it. I highly recommend this if you need extra motivations and incentives for any task or habits. It's a great tool for the kids. It's wonderful for my ADD/ADHD spouse and child. It is great for the RPG players and entertaining way to encourage growth! I'd give 10 stars!",1
10 stars!! This has helped me SO much with my lack of motivation to do simple tasks around the house. I love that my friends and I can be in a party and encourage each other to do our good habits in order to battle monsters! Plus it all helps scratch the D&D itch until we can get a campaign going haha I love this app!! Thank you ssssoooooo much for not putting ads in it!,1
"This is fantastic. Just an amazing way of tackling your life in an entertaining way. I have adhd, and I found that the various incentives and disincentives offered by this app, as well as the customization of your tasks (being able to set up daily tasks, to do lists, and habits) and community challenges to help you make some life-bettering choices. That's not even all of it. Give this app a check if you're trying to get your life together.",1
"I love this app. It really has motivated me to be more productive every day. I'll check it and think, ""Man if I just had a few more coins, I could buy this."" And then off I go to do a load of laundry or work out. My only real issue with the app is the syncing issues. Those ARE annoying, but the team seems responsive so I expect they'll be fixed soon. I also hope they add more normal pets! Would love to see some reptiles or bug pets. They're all cute mammals except the dragon, so far.",1
"I've used this app for half a year now without missing a day, and bought half the optionail quests in the shop...though honestly that might change, the new UI for hatching and feeding pets is abysimal. Idk who decided to make you scroll through every food that's ever existed to find the piece of food you do have...feed the one piece then repeat, but it's made the 5 minute stop before bed a lot longer and is really starting to kill it for me. still, 5 stars because my wife and I have enjoyed it.",1
"I love Habitica! I've used it for several years, both the browser version and the app. I love how simple it is and I love the social aspect! I've been able to make friends and find support through guilds, and my party really pushes each other to be our best and continually improve! This app has helped me focus on self care and get better grades in school. I'm building healthy habits and having fun with the creative quests and interactions! Habitica is amazing!",1
"First productivity app I've ever been able to stick with. It's easy to use, tutorials so you don't have to struggle to learn. It's actually fun to finish tasks and get XP. I put every little thing in here and at the end of the day I've leveled up AND I feel great for having done stuff. I'm looking forward to joining a party and starting my first quest against those vile dust bunnies. I've already shared this app with all my lazy gamer friends. XD",1
love it started using it in rehab,1
i use it on and off for years now. setting the power options in the phone to allow the app to run will prevent the issue with no reminders. not sure why people cannot figure that part out. everything works well and runs smooth on my end. been enjoying it!,1
Good app,1
Cool idea on how to organize yourself in a interesting new ways!,1
Feels like I'm playing dungeons and dragons. Love it.,1

Great app! üòÅ,1
not bad,1
"Didn't expect this to be as handy and motivating as it is- it's great for errands and reminders as well as chores. It does freeze up if it's been sitting open or if I clicked into another app (say, to make a phone call), which is annoying, but closing and re-opening the app fixes it. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a little extra encouragement to get things done, including things you might be a little anxious about (like phone calls).",1
Great productivity application!,1

I creat taskA and move it, it moves to a random location and won't let me move it again) Aside from this bug, I like this app a lot",1
Nice app,1

"I've tried lots of to-do apps and this one has all the functions I need. It has flexible snoozing options for alarms, persistent audible alarms and lots of cross-platform options, including in a web browser. You can back up, import or print tasks too, and view them with your calendar events to get a full picture of your day. And, of course, widgets. It even has a drag and drop Eisenhower matrix, something I've always wanred.",1
"Great app. This app, alongwith David Alen's book Getting Things Done was a life changer for me.",1
Great task/to-do list,1
It's great! I have been using it for about 3 years. It would be nice if we can set the break time after each pomos manually per session instead of set it via settings.,1
Very goodüëç,1
"love it, help me alot with managing my projects",1
love the pomodoro timer built in,1
Very useful app for task management. It has many advanced features.,1
"It seemed really helpful, and getting all of my daily tasks done is so much easier when motivated. It's super fun and easy to understand. The only problem I have is I can't use it, because I don't have Internet at home where I'm trying to get these things done... Seems kind of silly that I can't complete a task offline. If y'all made checking off tasks available while offline I would totally come back, but as it is, it's usefully nonuseful.",1
"I love it. The only issue I have is that it won't allow me to make a challenge for my party. I bought diamonds for rewards, but I have tried 4 times. It doesn't take the diamonds, so I guess it can't be a glitch. Maybe it is because we are doing a quest? It doesn't say. Oh and it does say Server lost sometimes but I still ha e connection.. Other than that, I just wish there were other options for the rewards that could be used in the game. Ones the player can create.",1
"Awesome concept, definitely a game changer for those with ADHD, but this app needs serious cleaning up. There are a lot of bugs to fix, and the app can be very slow at times. But once those issues get fixed, this will be no doubt a game changer for those struggling with ADHD or motivation in general.",1
"Overall app is pretty great. There are some UI hiccups, mostly related to occasional lag and buttons not working the first time because of timeouts. A little irritating, but far from a deal breaker. The app has definitely helped motivate me to be far more productive and on-task.",1
I have had Habitica on and off for maybe 4 years now and have overall enjoyed the experience! I got quite attached to my little player at least to the point where I would do tasks to make sure they didn't die. It sucked they got rid of guilds because some good challenges came from them. whoever designs the armor is the best! I have fallen off a few times but come back more!,1
"It's the most feature rich Todo app among all I have used striking the perfect balance between minimalism and features. The way todo's, focus timer, calendar and habits integrate with each other is awesome. Desktop app give native experience unlike other Todo apps just packing web version in a window. Only few areas of improvement required: 1. Natural language processing(Todoist is good at it comparatively) 2. Slight design and UI modifications to make it more appealing",1
"Really amazing app to stay organized and productive, keeping notes, memos, tracking plans / projects / tasks, etc. Many customisation options, filter, tags etc. that it would probably satisfy anyone. So much that it takes time to learn how to get most of it :-) So much possibilities even in free version. Also a big plus is Web App so one could work efficiently in any device in sync. Definitely 5*!",1
This is the best app out there for tracking to do. You can even collobrate with 2 people in the free plan. Have been a very happy user for the last year.,1

A fantastic tool to organize life. Has everything I need in one app.,1
I will often look at other productivity apps and it always makes me realize how thoughtful this app is. Notes could be better and the absence of spell check in the web app is annoying. Otherwise its highly customizable and nearly perfect.,1

"Best app for organising your life. Put reminders of what you need to do so you will not forget. Schedule recurrent takes like paying bills or adding meter readings. Birthday, anniversary with multiple reminders (different times/days) so you will remember to prepare for them. Great search, this way you can write down everything you want to keep and find it easily, like how much pressure to put in your car tyres, pants size and anything else you can think of. This is just the free part of it.",1
"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved",1
"A legendary application, perfect in every aspect",1
Amazing,1
"It shines with features where it should and keeps it simple wherever complexity is not desired! Overall, I just keep on being impressed with how well this app is planned-out. You can select what you use and keep out of sight what would only disturb. You can personalize it in this way. The discoverability of features is gradual and unintrusive but there is a great variety of them that this app offers... I am considering to upgrade to premium only to support dev work, since the free version is top",1
I like the functionality of this app better than it's competitors,1

Have used it for years nearly every day. The app is fantastic.,1
Best task and calendar app I've ever used! I have searched for years to find an app that does both tasks in depth while allowing you to put those tasks into a Google calendar. I hate making a long lists of tasks with dates and then having to spend double the amount of time putting them into my calendar and then triple the amount of time taking them both out of my calendar and task app when they are completed. This app wraps it all up into one simple system that I absolutely adore!,1
"This app is so useful. It syncs between my phone, my windows laptop, and my Chromebook, which means I always have access to my to do list. It has a ""focus mode"" timer, which shows you how long you concentrated in total that day. The ""daily habits"" feature is great, you can turn on a setting that prompts you to write a few paragraphs about the experience. Really helps you keep track of how things are going with the habit. 5/5",1
"Incredible!! I spent 2 hours adding & deleting apps looking for one that allows me to input exactly what I want, looks nice & time functions the way I need. Problem solved! This app is totally awesome! Thank you for leaving everything OPEN, I can put chores in, personal goals, habits, to do tasks, add in meals, has a calendar....monthly weekly...daily...hourly if needed! You set it all based on what you need!! I love it...you can make it you! THX!",1
"This todo list app definately stanfs above the almost the same todo_wonderlist_tasks type of app. I love its flexibility to make your own processes, love the integration of other calendars, love the preset lists, and most importantly i love the widget! I can make a todo list widget on one screen, and my shopping list widget on the other. Plus I can make each lines super tight to see the list without to constantly scrolling up and down. Great app.",1
"Very intuitive and stable app! The developers did a very good job programming this application. The app is great as is, but I hope the developers will implement task/list templates in the future so users can save their favorite lists and tasks to easily duplicate them for routine events, and also the ability to link tasks would be awesome! I am subscribing to the premium plan today and look forward to using the app for a very long time!",1
"Love this app! I spent so much time looking for an app that would suit my needs. The reminder notifications work well, I like that it stays in my notifications until I complete it or snooze it. I can mark it done from the notification, big requirement. The habit feature is also useful without feeling like I'm being nagged. After a few months I was so happy with it I bought a year subscription for added features. The price is very reasonable. Can't say enough good about Tick Tick",1
"best free version of a to do list app I've ever used. I came to this app after being frustrated with todoists sorting algorithm and lack of features for their free version, and I'm glad I left. TickTick has far more features and is smarter at sorting tasks, the pomodoro feature is especially handy for studying, though I would really like to see the inclusion of multiple pomodoro setting profiles so I wouldn't have to change the focus/break ratio each time, otherwise an excellent app üôÇ",1
"I'm in love with this app.  Every time I think ""man, I wish it had feature X"" or ""I wish it supported this workflow"" I spend 5 minutes digging in the settings and low-and-behold, there's always a perfect combination for me.  I haven't felt this much trust in the quality and feature-richness of a new app in a long time.  This has made my transition away from Google Inbox for reminder management MUCH smoother.",1
"I have used Wunderlist for about 5 years, but now its being retired. I tested and tried 10+ apps since then, and none were that great. I stumbled upon TickTick, and wish I had started using it years ago. TickTick has much greater customization options, and does a great job of incentivizing completion of tasks via feedback. It has made my life much easier. I do wish the widget had options to change how it appears, the ""to dos"" do not have breaks between them.",1
"No problems with it! Love the calendar integration, voice input, sync with desktop. 2020 update: This is my favorite app and it keeps getting better. The widgets are really useful, as are the custom filtered lists. I have ADHD, and usually forget a lot, but I put literally everything I want to remember in this app: tasks, appointments, movie recommendations. It's easy to sort and tag all everything I put in the app, and I love that it works with my laptop and web browser as well!",1
"easy to navigate, simple to learn, and straight forward. needed something mainly to take notes with for planning out projects or scheduling tasks in advance. but it does alot more than just that, great tool to effectively use the eisenhower matrix. also makes use of tagging system to link between certain tasks and projects and make them easier to find. could be a really useful tool for anyone who feels a little overwhelmed and scatter brained when under pressure. make the most of your time.",1
"Had some weird hiccups and things to first figure it out, but got it going smoothly. Love the option to share todo lists, and the integration with other calendars. Stand alone web version also good, widget isn't great, but all around a very solid app. No intrusive ads, and a robust free version that is still worth using it you don't want to pay the monthly fee. Highly recommend trying it out.",1
"I've tried many productivity hacks, tools, and methods. This app is something that has stayed consistent throughout. It has everything you need in one place, no ads, and the pro features are for things that are extra, like for a company or team. My favorite part is how much you can customize every to-do list, folder and sub-folder to go with your personal style of working. Definitely worth downloading.",1
"I've been using this app for years. I'm in college and I love being able to have lists for classes and putting them all into a smart list. I have tags for things like homework and reading I have to do. When I discovered the pomo timer, I was pleasantly surprised. In the past I've rigged up my own with timers, but it's great having one built in. I use the pomo timer when I'm doing homework and I like having the various white noise options to keep me from wandering. The new UI looks great!",1
"Tick Tick is great. My daughter recommended it to me. She likes the natural language option. I love the option to create habits out of recurring to do tasks, that's important for me, as I'm using Tick Tick in part to try to put my life back together after my husband's death. It's very helpful to have a checklist and form habits that are little in the moment but cumulatively make a big difference. Still trying to figure out how to not have a date for a list item though (for book/grocery lists).",1
"Great lightweight app that does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simple to use and has great widgets. I've tried several different free task apps and this is the one that does exactly what I want without over-complicating things. I'm always recommending this app when people start complaining about not being able to keep track of tasks, bills, appts, etc. I've been using this for a few years now and haven't had any issues with crashes or really anything.",1
"Tick Tick is STILL just hitting it out of the park for me. I originally starting using it because I loved the built in pomo, along with habit tracking. A few months back I got interested in using a kanban board but they did not integrate well with a to do list. Now I see that tick tick has added the option of viewing lists in a kanban style. It is AMAZING. Now it's a truly powerful app that can be a one stop shop for every productivity tool I actually use. I love it!!!",1
We have been using TickTick for a few years for home and personal management. Love that i can customize in so many different ways when things can repeat. A feature i would love to have is being able to share a folder with one or more other people. Everyone who is sharing the folder could then add items or click that it is done without seeing everything else in my account. I like the features that are in the laptop version and not in the phone app so I mostly use that version.,1
Absolutely love it. This is the only app that I have found that allows extremely quick entry of ideas and thoughts. I used Google keep for years but had to continue using a paper note system because it was time-consuming to enter notes into Google keep. I subscribe to the premium version of tick tick in order to use the quick ball. It appears on all my screens and is the fastest way to enter ideas. there are many other features than I love about this app and it is well worth the money.,1
"Amazing! Best app that syncs with my calendar. Easy to use and understand. Now feature is great. Scheduling with tasks and quick reminders with a simplistic design. Honestly, I can't recommend this app enough. I've been using it for 3 months now and am using it continually. After one week I went premium and I know I don't need to search anymore. I've found the productivity so I've been looking for!",1
"Exactly what I needed! using the free version, which has its restrictions, but retains plenty of functionality and is very useful and helpful. Able to share/collaborate which is endlessly great for grocery shopping and the like. Clean and easy to use UI. Super highly recommended to anyone wanting to organize their lives with checklists.",1
"This is the only todo app that has ever worked for me. They got it right: due dates and reminders are completely separate. You can map out todos on your calendar in terms of when they're due, but still set complex reminders to pace you as you approach that date. Everything I've wished it could do, it just does in a natural way. With other todo apps, I'm always left wondering why it can't handle the natural use case, and it just ends up getting in the way. I feel less stressed than ever.",1
"This is exactly what I needed. The customizations are really in-depth and very helpful. I opted for the 2.99/mo subscription and so far it's already worth it. It's like a better version of Google calendar. Look at your daily routine and upcoming tasks at a glance. It's super intuitive. Within a half hour I set up my daily routine and upcoming events with absolutely no problems at all. If you're a busy person and need a way to organize your life, this is the app you need.",1
"I love the updates to this already wonderfully organized app! i particularly like the rich black theme. With so many wonderful features, the only thing this app needs now is unlimited categories for free. Keep up the good work! 8/21/19: I recently purchased the annual subscription, and was skeptical at first, but having more folders, lists and additional features has been a true blessing. Everytime I think of something that needs to get done, I add it to the list. Nice job!",1
"This app is so great, it can really fit so many different types of peoples needs. Creating basic checklists is super easy. But if you need more advanced ways for organization they have it! You can create so many lists, tags, and smart lists. They all have there functionality and a super easy set up. Not to mention the habit checker, while you can only have 3 with the free version it is a nice addition.",1
ü§çü§çü§ç,1
I'm starting using it as an alternative to MS To Do and Taskade. It's elegant and seems to be trustworthy for the long run to be used,1
"I make great use of the categories, using some lists for things with due dates, and others for ""would be nice to do someday"" things. very flexible!",1
Great app,1
Nice features and functionality.,1
This is a full-featured task manager...after trying several others I tried Tick Tick. I have used the paid app more than a year and have been very happy with it.,1
Great app!,1
"This has to be one of the best apps ever created. If you're someone who procrastinates a lot and wants to stop, then this app is for you. It's easy to use, has so many features, and it has honestly changed my life. I highly recommend this app.",1
Underrated reminder app fr,1
"the most useful app, I've ever used. Recommend everyone better than any todo apps, even todoist any",1
"Fantastic replacement for Wunderlist. Clean, efficient, good widget options, talks to the web app neatly, and doesn't requite you to pair your default Google login with it. I wish I could disable calendar because I only want it as a To-Do list, but you can't have everything.",1
Best To do list app I've used.. clean UI and good features,1
I love it,1
I just want to take a moment to thank the devs for developing such app and giving such awesome widgets ü§ùü´°excellent work,1
Good App Hope it was free,1
Helps me overcome my inconsistency executing daily activities. Now no problem.,1
I use the Eisenhower matrix and it's been good.,1
This is the best ToDo/Calendar I've used. It is very powerful and works across all of my devices.,1
An excellent and easy way to manage my tasks,1
Awesome üíØüíØüíØ,1
Very helpful in managing and tracking tasks,1
"Once in a while I write reviews, but I am pushed to review this app because of how much it has boosted my productivity. It's absolutely incredible how it has so much essential features you need everyday and yet manages to achieve the perfect blend of being non-invasive and still user friendly. From the smart features to the desktop app and extension, TickTick is truly changing the game of productivity tools.",1
"I really love this app. As an aspiring front end developer, I really love the UI of the app and really appreciate the amount of functions and sub functions avaliable in this app. The UI looks so attractive and beautiful to say the least. There are so many ways to customize the app according to your interests and it was perfect for me to deal with my procrastination. But I would suggest reducing the premium subscription, cuz the premium opens a new door to productivity heaven.",1
"Ticktick is the best! The interface is very workable, and the addition of tasks on a daily basis is very convenient. Plus, I really like the various kinds of themes one can use. Also, I have never recall the app getting stuck whatsoever! And their plan prices are affordable. I truly recommend this to all productive good people out there! Thanks to the Ticktick Team!",1
Exactly what I wanted and have been looking for in a task app.,1
Thank you... I like much... most helpful and motivated,1
Pretty good and supported in multiple platforms!!üòÅ,1
"Can the team please address the sluggish performance issue that arises when one has too many tasks scheduled for one day? I have noticed that when there are over 30 or 40 tasks, clicking on the menu button will crash the Android UI. It also slows the whole phone's performance down and causes more battery to be used until a reboot is performed. In general, I would classify this issue as severe.",1
Helps me manage a lot of things and makes my life organized.,1
Best Organizing Tool Ever!,1
This app is soo useful. I like this app üëçüëçüëçüëç,1
Best without doubt,1
"At last a to do list that's got the powers of todoist and Microsoft To Do, with a sensible price and solid UI. Desktop app good too. In particular, I love the reminders and how they appear as a notification and can be snoozed. I also love the calendar view where you can organise your tasks into time slots. The Eisenhower grid could have great potential but I'd have to remember to add a priority to every to do and I forget to often.",1
Nice ..,1
A Great app,1
"love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.",1
"This to-do list app/game has lots of fun things to unlock as you level up and earn money and simple details that go a long way like the tasks changing color to indicate how well or poorly you're performing tasks (mine were in the red most of the time lol), but personally I think the RPG stuff is a bit too distracting and makes tasks more concerning to complete. It's an ingenious idea, but not for me. Highly recommend for anyone else who's looking for a change of pace.",1
"I really enjoyed using the app and all its features. it helps a lot in my habit building and task management. Hence I subscribed to support this app. however the server is really bad... been having server connection issue from time to time, and started from yesterday, the server has been down. Can't login still. please can you fix the issue? update - the issue was fixed. thanks for the fast response.",1
useful,1
"I absolutely love Habitica! It helped me a lot! I currently have 600 check-ins and I'm using it since mid 2022. Habitica helped me not only because of the gamification but also because its simple and efficient UI. I'm rating it 4 stars because the app it self needs more care. I've experienced many bugs and glitches and the desynchronization with the server is really annoying, which can lead to a very bad UX when using the app. Other than this, very good idea!! I use habitica everyday.",1
hope,1
"The ""plus and minus"" feature really makes this app stand out among habit builder apps. It's actually the main reason I use this app. That said, I have no idea what pets or mounts do.",1
well i didn't use it for long time but i guess it going to be in perfect experience üëçüèª,1
"I'm just started, and I like it",1
"The ""plus and minus"" feature really makes this app stand out among habit builder apps. It's actually the main reason I use this app. That said, I have no idea what pets or mounts do.",1
Good for habit tracking but doesn't gamify the habits enough. Wish there was an actual rpg or something that you could use your character within. It would add to the accountability and add incentives.,1
"This app is quite nice! However it still has some bugs that need to be patched. Like for example, head gear becomes inverted in dark mode (except when it doesn't). Also I love the fact that this is open source :p",1
"Habits and dailies are confusing, because sometimes it's green even i haven't done the task today. So i forget a lot if i actually done the task yet or not. I switched to To-Do instead, although it's a bit annoying since i have to keep adding new one after i tick the task.",1
"Hi Habitica, I really love your app and it help me in my education planning but there is a problem that I cant use it without VPN if you can please help me to slove it because I really need your app and service.",1
"PLEASE for the love of god, add a weekly/monthly visual on habit/daily tracking. This app would be perfect ü•≤",1
Really great app to keep you on schedule. I do wish that more of the pets and items were available without buying gems though.,1
I enjoy it so far. One of the things I'd change would so Habits could have reminders. And maybe a better tutorial for how to use Parties..,1
"Helps me remember to complete my daily tasks, but the rewards don't really do it for me. The dopamine hit comes entirely from checking off the lists.",1
"It's an amazing app to have with a very supportive community. However the lagging is a big drawback. Widgets are not working properly, screen and party chat are not refreshed immediately. If these improvements are made, then there is no doubt in my mind that this will be one of the best self help apps out there.",1
"really good! however, the system is sort of broken once you unlock all possible equipment and mounts. other than that, Amazing!!!!!",1
"it's good. it's fun to use with family too, but it's boring without many engaging 'reasons' to invest in the leveling up aspect",1
I love this app! It would be great if we could also see completed tasks and daily habits (or something like a log).,1
It's lacking some features that are only available on the browser version and has some other bugs but it's still useful.,1
"It's good, totally. But it would be better if I could undo a ""To Do"" because I just accidentally pressed it to be completed. And also, it would be nicer if I could look at my previous ""To Do"" things in the app.",1
"I rate it 4.5/5.0 for the UI,, has the smoothest gamify interface. Has community among user for goals inside the app. A little bit confused how the reset by the end of the day works. I also don't know how to raise it's character beside completing task. I'm giving it a 3 star personally because I cannot maximize all the features it has.",1
"The game part of it, I don't really get. I'm a long time rpg player and this is not super engaging imo. But, I think this is the best habit tracker I've found and I really appreciate the widgets.",1
"This really helps our ADHD asses focus. It's just so much fun! We would pay for this app if their was a 'household' mode. Something like the party but with shared Daily and Todo lists. Maybe with an easy shortxut to share them from your personal list. Something like 'feed the dog' is sometimes done by me, sometimes by the partner. It would also make sure we don't feed them twice :D Edit: I'm also missing an option for no counter reset, seems like an easy addition.",1
"I think the app is awesome and gets everything right while still making it economically viable, but they shouldn't have removed the tavern and the guilds. The app doesn't do your stuff for you though, you still have to make an effort.",1
"I use this everyday. It's buggy but in a kind of begrudgingly loveable way? Hoping it sees updates eventually but this has really actually stuck with me and enabled me to change my life. Remember that change starts with you, and not an app!",1
Amazing app. Great for students. Only Suggestion that I have is that the quest story should have some animations and some sub events to make them more engaging.,1
"I'm glad I tried this, but since the last update it won't work properly. It often won't update with tasks I mark completed and this morning, it won't register the new day and refresh my dailies.",1
"Only negative, the chat feature is not ideal. Though least important feature. Other than that, amazing, 10/10. Goal setting is easy, separating your to dos on their corresponding category is super useful. Also, love how it treats you like a responsible adult, you can cheat very easily, but in the end that's not going to help you. PS I have a Huawei phone. And the fact that it connects to the internet instead of Google play, makes it easy to keep me connected. For me, most important. Thank you!",1
"I am just started the app but I recommend you that >Make better graphics. > Make a complete tutorial of the app *what you can do? What should you do?( I skipped all the tutorial that said in the beginning, then I did not know what to do. so I deleted my account, recreated it) >Give us a option to select boy or girl ( I could not understand what my avatar is a boy? Or a girl?) **( I am saying this has my opinion and I am using the app in android, I don't about other users and platforms)**",1
"The game part of it, I don't really get. I'm a long time rpg player and this is not super engaging imo. But, I think this is the best habit tracker I've found and I really appreciate the widgets.",1
"pretty great overall as a task manager, but it's a little lacking as a ""game"". I still use this app for my daily routine and todolist, and it really helped me unlock my ADHD and find success in my life :) the actual gameplay is really limited, not very interactive, it's way too easy to level up and unlock lategame content even if you aren't trying to cheese it. and the lategame content is... kinda nothing lol. there's not much to do. but anyways, as a task manager alone, it's great!",1
it really helps. wish it was actually fun though. its a very very nice to-do list kind of app.,1
Nicely done and a good motivator.,1
"The message wetting system is a bit buggy, but I prefer using this app as opposed to the website xD",1
"It takes a bit of time to understand the mechanics, but once it is clear how it works, it can really help as a platform to help you live your life to your own vision, goals, habits, and daily to do's. After about 2 years of active membership, I do enjoy still using it daily to check of my daily habits. There are many creative ways in which you can create your habits, make a sustainable system for yourself, and a character. It& community can be fun too. All in all, habitica has bettered my life",1
"I think the app is awesome and gets everything right while still making it economically viable, but they shouldn't have removed the tavern and the guilds. The app doesn't do your stuff for you though, you still have to make an effort.",1
Amazing app. Great for students. Only Suggestion that I have is that the quest story should have some animations and some sub events to make them more engaging.,1
there are a few aboying bugs. like it sometimes loses your inputs because of a failure to conect to the server. But I really like the concept of gamifying my life and I find it hits a good balance. not too much game so that it doesn't become a time-suck. Enough game to keep me interested.,1
It's awesome but it sometimes glitches in the mobile.,1
"I love this app. It's been amazing at helping me keep up with my tasks. It's a bit tricky to navigate at times, which is why I mark it 4 and not 5. Also goes ""out of sync"" when you do an action like feeding your pets or marking tasks too quickly",1
please make it available offline,1
"The concept of this app is really good. I do have one suggestion however, I hope the Habitica team adds some sort of a note feature next to our profile details (I'm talking about the web application because it'd look messy on the mobile app) where we could just type what's on our head at the moment. Right now, that area is completely covered with the suggestion to add your friends or something. this is irrelevant to some users because maybe they like to work alone. thank you for making this app",1
Really great app to gamify your tasks if that motivates you,1
"Overall app is pretty great. There are some UI hiccups, mostly related to occasional lag and buttons not working the first time because of timeouts. A little irritating, but far from a deal breaker. The app has definitely helped motivate me to be far more productive and on-task.",1
great app! I wish there are more animations of big fireworks and stars and trophies after every task so users would feel encouraged! Like in candy crush!,1
I love this app but it does have clunky things once in awhile,1
"Only started using this app yesterday, but the Wear OS Experience does need improvement, especially on the aspect of that it could use a Watch Face, as well as being able to complete checklist items on my tasks.",1
"pretty good, I think the ethics driving its development for those O f us who grew up in the 80s has a nostalgic quality",1
"really good! however, the system is sort of broken once you unlock all possible equipment and mounts. other than that, Amazing!!!!!",1
Couldn't see the sign in stuff cause the text and the background were white,1
very helpful for staying on track.,1
I have had Habitica on and off for maybe 4 years now and have overall enjoyed the experience! I got quite attached to my little player at least to the point where I would do tasks to make sure they didn't die. It sucked they got rid of guilds because some good challenges came from them. whoever designs the armor is the best! I have fallen off a few times but come back more!,1
now I'm very happy for this app I gave 4 stars,1
"Hey there Habitica team,I just wanted to express how much I adore your app! It has truly been a game-changer for me in maintaining my daily schedule. As someone who tends to get bored easily, gamifying my routine has made it not only manageable but enjoyable too.I strongly believe that adding the option to switch the pixel avatar to animated ones would make customization more detailed and enhance the personal touch. After all, it's the little details that truly make a difference, don't you think",1
it's super fun to use and I've leveled up a few,1
Excellent but make it available office that's the only problem.,1
"it's good. it's fun to use with family too, but it's boring without many engaging 'reasons' to invest in the leveling up aspect",1
"Great, but should work offline too",1
It's lacking some features that are only available on the browser version and has some other bugs but it's still useful.,1
"So far so good. The XP rewards really make me want to complete the tasks, and the app sends reminders every time I need it. So far, my main complaints are that the app can be a bit slow when new chats pop in (which maybe a phone issue) and the fact that no explanation was given about how buying a weapon assigns you to a class immediately, which you are stuck with till LV 10. It's not much admittedly, but I'm a bit afraid of spending my coins on the warriors class now. Overall, good job!",1
I love this app! It would be great if we could also see completed tasks and daily habits (or something like a log).,1
Amazing Apps,1
"Hi Habitica, I really love your app and it help me in my education planning but there is a problem that I cant use it without VPN if you can please help me to slove it because I really need your app and service.",1
"please , PLEASE improve your widgets. They have potential, they could be more convenient PLEASE MAKE THEM MORE CUSTOMIZABLE, INTERACTIVE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME I'm too lazy for opening the actual program. all I want is checklist on my homepage pleaseee I want to use this cute program just do thissss",1
I like that instead of tracking myself like a well performing business model I'm just levelling up a little guy. my critique would be that the app has quite a lot of features so gets a bit confusing but I love it for the most part,1
"It's a really good app, helped me to start being consistent with my habits. The idea of losing health if you don't do them really feels like video-game dailies xD but I'd say the past month or two, there's been connectivity problems on the app. Server connection lost, or things not syncing properly. Just experienced it again today. But aside from that, the segregation of habits, dailies, and tasks is pretty unique and once you get the hang of it, it's absolutely worth it.",1
"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",1
"It works, but it has issues... the thing is, compared to some other apps of it's kind, its not great. It could use some more customization, like custom items, and the tutorial is kinda annoying, especially with pre made tasks. But, it does what it says and well enough Edit: Thanks to the Habitica team for responding, some developers don't care, but it's good to know this app has a great community!",1
"The graphics are adorable, and the UI is clean. There were a few things that were a little confusing to find, but there's a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the FAQ. The only reason it doesn't work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression. Other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path, which feels more like moving forward. Cute app, but more for those who like armor building in MMOs.",1
"I use a system similar to the one this app offers where I reward myself points for completing tasks and can cash them in for rewards, usually in the form of time to play videogames. Really wish that you could customize how many coins you get for completing a task, rather than getting a seemingly random amount tied to a range of difficulties. If that was the case this app would've completely replaced my manual score keeping system. Still a mostly decent app for what it is. 4/5",1
"I'm enjoying the app so far. I couldn't figure out how to make a group for my family and close friends. It seems like the Party feature isn't customizable and the Guild feature requires currency which I'm not that far into yet. Also, I find it annoying that I can't organize my tasks by dragging it around the way I see fit. The filter is the only option which I have to redo that everytime which gets a little annoying. Overall, I'm enjoying this app as it did help with my productivity.",1
I really like the app and I've gotten used to it. I think there is a very large room to grow for this app. It has a good desktop support since it can be opened on a desktop browser but a smartwatch app with Wear OS/Huawei store support would be amazing. It would also be amazing if it could sync with google clock and calender. It would be really nice to be able to export my to-do list and dailies easily. If there is an easy way for this I haven't seen it.,1
"Absolutely love the app. Helps my friends and I organize our routines better, change/improve our habits, and have fun while doing it. My only problem with the game is that you can't set differing difficulties for succeeding/failing a challenge. Sometimes I'd like an easy challenge/daily to not reward me greatly, but punish me more severely should I fail, or vice versa.",1
Amazing app! It has really helped me to focus on what needs to get done in my life. A couple of suggestions on how this could be even better: 1st add a calendar function so we can look back and see when we completed a task (especially if it is repetitive task like doing laundry or washing dishes etc. to track our progress) and 2nd it would be great if it could sync with other calendars like google calendar or iCal. Please!!! I would love an update like this!!!,1
"A really great idea with a lot of great features! I love it a lot. However, it's a bit unresponsive at times. Actions that previously worked will occasionally not go through for mystery reasons . And the widgets, while displaying correctly, have bad interactivity. Thats said, the art is cute, the features are helpful and extensive, and the positive impact it has on my habits is amazing",1
"Idea: Quests should focus on achieving goals and developing habbits and have difficulty levels. When you accept the quest, it automatically adds those tasks to your list. Example: Take a new quest from the ""QuestBoard"" Called A quest for great strength. Description - Go to they gym to develop your heroic muscles. Difficulty: Easy - Exercise 1 day a week for 1 month. Medium - exercise 2 days a week, Etc. Then you get the quest reward after completing it. This helps people set goals and come back.",1
"I've really enjoyed habitca in the couple weeks I've been using it. I was surprised how motivating it is. Getting to level 10 to unlock the rest of the features had been longer than I would like, but it's a very cool app. There are a couple minor bugs like having to manually refresh a page that you just went to for accurate info. Another little big is sometimes my task descriptions will be swapped or cloned. A refresh fixes that too, though",1
"This app is amazing! It's been so helpful to my ADHD so far. My only gripes are that, occasionally, there are glitches that make it so if you drag to reorder something it goes farther than it's supposed to, and it will display the habits as a different habit than it is. These are easy to fix by restarting the app, though. I also really want a way to copy a to do, habit, or daily so that I don't have to rewrite a long check list on a to-do that only appears again on an irregular basis.",1
"Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel.",1
"If you love RPGs and/or collecting, you'll probably like Habitica even if it doesn't offer real-world incentives. I even got a subscription so I could get more pets and gear. I've gained around 10k gold and have actually enjoyed putting work into the app itself. But lately I've inexplicably started losing health at a higher rate despite having fewer incomplete tasks and just lost ALL the gold. It quantifies your hard work and then deletes it all? Negative reinforcement like that is unhelpful.",1
"I really like it so far, but I really wish the dailies didn't HAVE to have fixed days of the week. Aspects of my schedule fluctuate out of my control and it would be nice to set ""3x/week"" instead of only specific days like some other habit trackers can do. I also wish I could see a log of how often I have been doing stuff.(though I like this one overall better). I like how things change color depending on how well you are doing with the habit and I like my little lion pet.",1
"I really like the idea of this app. However, I wish there was an easier way to revert everything (not just automatically changing gold or experience) to before completing a task or habit. Every time I press a task or habit when I didn't mean to, I have to figure out how to deal with items I unintentionally received or quest progress I didn't want progressing. Maybe make some kind of ""save point"" to deal with this?",1
"A great app for tracking habits and to-dos, especially when you have accountability buddies, but as someone who doesn't have that currently, I've noticed some flaws. Early on, I mistakenly put points towards a perk that matched the class I wanted to play - one that made missing tasks hit less hard, which ultimately means that now I don't get that encouragement I need to *actually do those things*, and I have no way to reassign points as far as I know. Otherwise, though, great app, super helpful.",1
"It's a great app for shaking out the mind fog, really cute as well. It's a little overwhelming at first, but makes sense after spending time with it. It would be cool if the app had different skins, 8 bit is nice but 16bit would look even better. An opportunity for aesthetic user generated content perhaps? I'm only leaving off a star because sometimes it glitches and won't show any of your tasks.. you have to close and reopen, and in some cases clear the cache. Very annoying.",1
"Just downloaded yesterday, so far so good. I just wish I could customize the date options a bit more. For example, I would like to do a task 2-3 times a week, and the only way I can currently put it into the habit tracker is by selecting the specific days to do the task on, which isn't realistic for me. I'm also using this for cleaning tasks, one I'd like to do biweekly, which also isn't an option currently. Overall really cute app that's very motivating for self care and chores.",1
"I love the concept and this serves very well as a motivational tool. Only improvements i can think of: i wish you could set different levels for the +/- on the habits screen. Like gaining small when you follow a good habit and losing big when you fail, etc. to provide greater motivation to follow good habits and prioritize more. I find it hard to find a comfortable difficulty for some tasks, so making them more adjustable in terms of benefits and consequences would be great.",1
"I love using this app. It seems to be the only option that can assign points for completing each habit, daily task and to-do and then set up your own rewards to use those earned points. I needed more motivation to get stuff stuff, and this gamifies things for me. However, I would really like a way to reuse completed to-dos. I want to be able to click on the completed task and then save it to have it as a new, open task. I do some things regularly but not as dailies or on set days.",1
"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",1
"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!",1
"I do enjoy using this app. It has helped me organize my tasks and habits very effectively. My only suggestion is to have the ability to organize the dailies and to-do list according to the reminder times and due dates. (Ex. Morning tasks at the top of the list.) This way I can go down the list instead of having to scatter to check the boxes. Otherwise, very well done. üëè",1
"A little buggy sometimes but all is forgiven for how much this app helps me be a more productive and motivated person. I have one request, please add some sort of real life stat tracker. The idea would be to assign tasks, habits, or dailies to certain skill categories and you could track points, levels, or hours for certain skills. For example, this would be cool for me to keep track of my progress towards mastery as a woodworker or painter etc.",1
"Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.",1
"Resisted trying this out because I always thought that with good planning and organization skills you could overcome certain life priorities. After trying it out for more than 2 weeks, it's changed my mind. But I think it's silly how much more gold and experience I get when I join a party. I actually don't understand the party functions, how I'm able to fight quests, etc. I guess it's automatic. Seems like I cannot choose a class change at lvl 10 like it says. Is this a bug?",1
"Habitica was nice but I just couldn't get as ""into it"" as I needed to be for it to work. Great concept, but remembering to check/update an app once a day became a chore rather than an excitement. Eventually I just gave up entering tasks because it was too much upkeep for me, especially with groups and party quests. If you're a little more dedicated than me and like having a community to keep you accountable, I would recommend it!",1
"Has been great, love the app. One recommendation: I would like to see the dailies have a scheduling option that allows a range of dates for a monthly task, such as a report that needs done sometime during the first week of the month but not having that daily give damage for not completing it until you fail to complete by the end and once it's checked for the week it doesn't show up again until the next month.",1
"9/16/23: Previous review is still fairly accurate, and I still like this app overall. Unfortunately, recent server issues render it unusable. They also removed tavern and guilds, which were helpful social features. 11/19/22: This is a great app for chores and tasks. When I need to remember to do something, I just record it as a task. It is very simple and easy to use. I haven't participated in any of the quests, but I do enjoy the armor and pets you can obtain.",1
"It's useful and it's fun, I haven't seen an add in the weeks I have been using it so far. It was time consuming to set up all my tasks but once set up it's great. The only issue I have is with the glitches, when I first go to check things off it moves the list around and checks off the wrong tasks but it's easy to fix, just annoying that it happens every single day.",1
"Changes my mindset about focus. I somehow switch to focus work much more easily when I think ""I'm going to plant a tree now"" (positive) instead of ""I'm should stop doing this distracting thing"" (negative). I paid a little extra for pro so I can set an allow list with apps I need for work - worth it. Unfortunately a known bug I reported months ago is not fixed (ringtone sounds when a session completes). I'd like to use this for bedtime, but then it starts making noise at 1am (overriding DND!)",1
"This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week.",1
"I've used this app for years off and on. I stay because I like my party and I want to unlock all the pets and mounts in every color. It's not a strong motivator for me, but it keeps me on the app. My main complaint is the lack of organization. The to-do's are hard to organize. I think there should be sections. Notifications often don't work, and I don't like the habits section. I use this app in tandem w/ Google Tasks and a paper planner",1
"Absolutely Wonderful. Super customizable, you can really tweak it to work in whatever way motivates you best. I'd give 5 stars if you could NAME the PETS and if it had a more consistent connection to the server.",1
"Hey, new user here, I find the app pretty cool but there is one thing that I noticed. Not sure if this is my mistake or a ""bug"", but I have some weakly habits, and for those habits I have a reminder that will go of, for example, at 19:30. The issue is, the weakly habit os only set up for Wednesday at 19:30 but the reminder goes of at every day of the week. Is this a known issue? Have I created the habit wrongly?",1
"Hey there Habitica team,I just wanted to express how much I adore your app! It has truly been a game-changer for me in maintaining my daily schedule. As someone who tends to get bored easily, gamifying my routine has made it not only manageable but enjoyable too.I strongly believe that adding the option to switch the pixel avatar to animated ones would make customization more detailed and enhance the personal touch. After all, it's the little details that truly make a difference, don't you think",1
"I love this app. It's been amazing at helping me keep up with my tasks. It's a bit tricky to navigate at times, which is why I mark it 4 and not 5. Also goes ""out of sync"" when you do an action like feeding your pets or marking tasks too quickly",1
"It takes a bit of time to understand the mechanics, but once it is clear how it works, it can really help as a platform to help you live your life to your own vision, goals, habits, and daily to do's. After about 2 years of active membership, I do enjoy still using it daily to check of my daily habits. There are many creative ways in which you can create your habits, make a sustainable system for yourself, and a character. It& community can be fun too. All in all, habitica has bettered my life",1
there are a few aboying bugs. like it sometimes loses your inputs because of a failure to conect to the server. But I really like the concept of gamifying my life and I find it hits a good balance. not too much game so that it doesn't become a time-suck. Enough game to keep me interested.,1
"The concept of this app is really good. I do have one suggestion however, I hope the Habitica team adds some sort of a note feature next to our profile details (I'm talking about the web application because it'd look messy on the mobile app) where we could just type what's on our head at the moment. Right now, that area is completely covered with the suggestion to add your friends or something. this is irrelevant to some users because maybe they like to work alone. thank you for making this app",1
"This is a fun app that is best used with a group of friends for casual habit taking. It does lack proper statistics and analytical features, though. Beyond a basic streak counter for every habit and basic goal functionality, it doesn't have much in terms of insights. No estimations, time-tracking, rolling period goals, etc. It's more of a commitment-contact-type game than a tool",1
"So far so good. The XP rewards really make me want to complete the tasks, and the app sends reminders every time I need it. So far, my main complaints are that the app can be a bit slow when new chats pop in (which maybe a phone issue) and the fact that no explanation was given about how buying a weapon assigns you to a class immediately, which you are stuck with till LV 10. It's not much admittedly, but I'm a bit afraid of spending my coins on the warriors class now. Overall, good job!",1
"I absolutely love Habitica! It helped me a lot! I currently have 600 check-ins and I'm using it since mid 2022. Habitica helped me not only because of the gamification but also because its simple and efficient UI. I'm rating it 4 stars because the app it self needs more care. I've experienced many bugs and glitches and the desynchronization with the server is really annoying, which can lead to a very bad UX when using the app. Other than this, very good idea!! I use habitica everyday.",1
"pretty great overall as a task manager, but it's a little lacking as a ""game"". I still use this app for my daily routine and todolist, and it really helped me unlock my ADHD and find success in my life :) the actual gameplay is really limited, not very interactive, it's way too easy to level up and unlock lategame content even if you aren't trying to cheese it. and the lategame content is... kinda nothing lol. there's not much to do. but anyways, as a task manager alone, it's great!",1
"So far I like it, however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety. You can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one. If the developers see this I suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200+ I found on my lists that all repeated. Although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of XP.",1
"habitica has been wonderful. it is easy to use and has been helping me pass my classes as well as quit smoking. highly recommend this to those with mental health issues/adhd cons -no offline functionality. it would be great to access the app offline even with limited capabilities -gems can't be bought with coins. it‚Äôs common to be able to buy hard currency with soft currency. i would be okay with this with sidebar or occasional ads, as i understand apps need to make money somehow.",1
"It's a well made little app and does as described. I recommend playing with it at least once. That being said, it doesn't take any time at all to get all of the free content. They release something maybe once a year for freemium players, and I think monthly IAPs? I deeply wish there was a way to get more out of the game without having to essentially get a subscription or do lottos with random people. I just really hate the not-free freemium model. I still say this game is still a good service.",1
"I really love this app! Overall I've found it really helpful and it kept me motivated to do tasks I needed to do. When it was working though, I wish there had been more options for customizing the avatar,l. Overall I'll miss this app since it doesn't like my phone anymore. Edit: I am no longer using a 5 year old phone and it works perfectly now! I'd still like new hair styles but other than that it's a highly recommended app ‚òÜ",1
"CAN YOU PLEASE ADD THE ABILITY TO HEAR A SAMPLE OF THE AUDIO THEMES BEFORE YOU SELECT THEM? I tried another popular RPG checklist app and I didnt like it as much. This app for me has been life-changing, literally. Its a great app for breaking bad habits, building up good habits or having a videogame style quest checklist that gives you instant gratification for completing real-world tasks. Theres some occasional glitches but nothing major, they can be fixed by closing the app and restarting it.",1
"This app is an amazing concept. I love the idea of everyday tasks as a game. It helps me digest and rationalize what's important while making it fun. My only issue is I wish you have make an end date for certain tasks you're gonna stop using. It's a small complaint tho, I usually just delete them when I'm done but I thought if it has a start date, it should also have an end date.",1
"This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.",1
"Health widget stopped working after latest Android update. Note 8. AT&T. Interesting take on habit forming. I'm not really a gamer but I like the point system, leveling up, and buying accessories for your avatar with those points. Nerdy fun that seems to actually be motivating me in a way other habit trackers haven't been able to. (The TED talk on the inspiration for this app is really interesting too.)",1
"Pretty good and entertaining way to keep track of personal progress, like, I deserve to be seen as a person of a specific level of skill and ability if I worked earnestly to get to that point. Issue is that it's a tool, not a guide, if you wont take your self improvement and mindfulness of habits seriously you're wasting time. Effort without heart is wasting time, but effort with the heartfelt intent to improve will help you move forward. No point in it if you're just going to slack off.",1
"Habitica is a super cool concept developed by people who know what they're doing in terms of code and game design, but fall short on UX design specifically for the app. There are so many features, it's hard to organize them well in the app. Highly recommend the desktop version, still recommend this app but just not as much.",1
"Love this app. I have really bad long covid and I struggle with tasks that used to be really easy, but habitica helps me stay motivated even when things are hard. Covid made me really forgetful too but habitica helps me keep a to do list. I wish the reminder timers worked better tho? I got them the first few times but they stopped for some reason.",1
"Cool app, but I wish I could see everything I own at once. When I get a new item, I have to search every inventory screen to figure out where is went. Confusing for new players. Also, if you don't have a party, it's basically a checklist since all the gane modes are forced multiplayer.",1
"I've had the app for more than two years. The quest feature is great for staying motivated. The to do list widget and support of markdown are also big advantages. I wish there was a better feature for getting an overview of how we've done in a week, like with charts and graphs. Another suggestion is adding a Pomodoro timer for each task.",1
"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.",1
"Decent app. I would like a history section to see a streak or see an upcoming task so I could do it earlier if I have more time today than tomorrow to do it. I would also like a feature where tasks can carry over. For example, say I set a daily to clean the bathroom toilet every 5 days. If I missed it in 5 days, I want it to move instead of disappearing. Otherwise I won't know to clean it until day 10. Better than the average habit/task tracking app.",1
"I love the concept, but it's not what I'm looking for, sadly. As far as my knowledge from just trying to set my schedule up goes, you can't pick certain days of the week you want to do certain things, and you can't set a certain time to remind you to do those things. It's either daily, weekly, or monthly. I absolutely love the concept of turning a schedule into a game though, and if just the few more things that I listed above were added, this would be very useful.",1
"I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.",1
"I love the new dark mode, I use dark mode for everything so this is much appreciated. The design has been streamlined and it's easy to use. I do check off all my tasks in one go, so the rewards popup blocking the last item on the list is a little annoying but workable. Just gotta wait a second for it to go away.",1
"Great interface and concept. What I appreciate most that other apps don't do is that they distinguish between habits, dailies, and to do's!! Props. Also I love the guilds concept as well. One suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made. But I get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar! Overall good job üëå",1
"The app is what you make of it. A big imagination will take you far. I wish it had better mobile support though. Many functions require a computer. And it'd be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems (the cash currency). Without a preview, its almost gambling, especially with hairstyles",1
"Love the idea, seems like it would work great for me. I also like the fact that there are browser extensions too! Unfortunately, you have to pay just to save your data and sync your browser extension to the app. Umm... Okay... I mean, great app and only $2 forever (unless you stop using Google Play Store) but... Just to save my data? I'll have to think about that...",1
"Great time-management tool! I set a focus goal and this app helps keep me on track. Phones can be huuuge distractions while working/studying but this limits the urge to scoll through scoials or play games when you want to be productive. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is I wish it had a schedule option. For example, I have history class every weekday from 8:35 to 9:20, it would be so helpful to be able to SCHEDULE that instead of having to go to my phone to start the timer. Overall great.",1
"This is a pretty neat app, and overall, it's great, especially if you don't want to touch your phone at all. Making focusing a game is a neat idea and it has little encouraging messages too. I tried out the feature to watch an ad and double my coins, but it didn't work. Not a big deal, but I just watched an ad for nothing when they also pop up ads periodically. The only thing I really want is the ability to have ""allowed apps"" or to block specifics apps. Like I have a dictionary app on my phone that I like to use while working, but I can't while this app is running. (You have to buy premium for this, but it's honestly something that should be a basic function.)",1
It's so cool app,1
Good,1
"Excellent app for your virtual focus on your work. It gives a timer, it gives reminder , it gives exceeded time and also to the most exciting thing that it's like a normal game! It has its own coins to unlock new types of plants and trees and other things.",1
goated,1
This app helped me a lot in focusing,1
Exllent,1
Works like a charm for pomodoro.,1
"Amazing, creates a friendly-competetive environment for me and my friends to successfully get out work done and learn many new things.",1
"This genuinely helps me with focusing throughout my day, staring off social media, and not getting mindlessly distracted. The trees and plants are cute and building your own little first becomes really fun.",1

Amazing app,1
Nice,1
Lovee,1
Awesome application for time bound work,1
I really haved a good Experience with this app i was so bad at the Geography but when i used this app GOSH I GOT 100/99 ITS SO USEFUL i REcOmMend DOWNLOADING IT,1
So annoying that so much more stuff is now a premium feature (like choosing which apps to lock during intense study mode) but the app is supporting a good cause and other than that it still works great. You still have plenty of features and options with the free version. I'm genuinely considering buying from the elixr shop to eventually help support the planting of real trees,1
Nice app,1
Good,1
Good,1
Had this app for a while and it really helps me with staying off my phone while giving nice in-app rewards. It also supports a great cause. 10/10 would recommend lol,1
"i love it, the trees are my motivation to study",1
Amazing app ever seen Best app to overcome procrastination,1
please add some more trees for free.,1
Great for staying focused,1
Amazing. I can't study without it. It gives me soo much motivation. I seriously love it sooo much,1
Very simple and helpful app,1
I'm fully satisfied with this productive app.,1
So cute. I'm going to rule the world using this app!!!,1
very use for competitive exam prepering aspirants üî•,1
Nice app. No ads and unique varities of plants to grow in our forest.,1
"The main reason I chose the premium version of this app is being able to easily upload media with your journal entry. Great to document hikes in my case. I've been having issues with their Coach feature and have reached out to them twice. Concerning being able to join 2 different programs for AM & PM journaling for instance. And not having the Coach prompts appear in their web version, only on mobile. Beyond the Coach feature, it has been great for me. Pretty simple to use.",1
"The one major short-coming of this app. (and most other ""habit trackers"") is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number (amount of hours, etc.) for a week or month--only a number of days or per day...That is a gaping deficit in these app's (with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats), as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from.day to day. The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service, as I e-mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade (because it is a really helpful/useful application), and never got any response in about a year's time. :-\ Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above--which I really hope they'll address/include that capability, it is a really helpful and useful app., and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ""OCD"" who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self-care and/or productivity (though, it could, also have the opposite effect, if people with ""OCD"" get too immersed in tracking things in their day-to-day :-S). In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*",1
Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.,1
"Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app.",1
"The app is simple enough if all you need is a way to keep track of daily successes. The free version doesn't come with any of the motivational stuff, which is a bummer. I also wish there was a way to update a goal moving forward. For example, if I set a goal to drink 60 ounces of water a day for 2 months, but I later want to change it to 80 ounces a day, I either update the goal (which changes any previous days less than 80 to failures), or start a new goal which forfeits the streak.",1
"This app is literally the only thing that reminds me to take my meds. I love getting the notifications and tracking my progress so easily. However I just upgraded to the pro version specifically for the sync capability and...it does not work. -1 star. For $10, I would hope that the one feature I wanted would function like it's supposed to. I'm not happy about that at all. The home screen widget comes in handy so it's not a total loss but that alone is not worth the price. Please fix syncing!",1
"Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version.",1
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,1
"Regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits. For someone like me who needs feedback, the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going. After using this app for almost two months I have been able to analyze and critique a few of the apps features. It would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do. In regards to the level of engagement I would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app. For functionality, the free version runs smoothly, is clear, and easy to use. For aesthetics, it is simple and convenient however I do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size. The information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources. I do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users. From my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4.1.",1
"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.",1
"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine.",1
love,1
it's an Amazing app! It doesn't let you distract üòå,1
"I've set my study time for 20 min. I wish an alarm would go off to notify me when 20 min is up, that way I know to go for a quick break before starting the timer again. Otherwise the app is great, it's like a little reward and helps me stay focused.",1
"Very nice and relaxing makes one fear not to kill the tree so u hust put the phone one side and study, excersise, work or what ever else it may be",1
Ok,1
"It is really very very helpful for my academics, and I really appreciate this also love this app so much",1
üëè amazing,1
Nice app,1
Good,1
Very good if you really want to study hard without distractions,1
Just what I needed right now! Full session of focus or no tree. Perfect,1
The most productive day I ever had was the furst day I installed this app,1
amazing,1
üòçüòçüòç,1
Very good,1
Well designed,1
It's a wonderful app. For a free app it is extremely useful. And it helped me to track my work and everything anywhere i went.,1
it was veryy good app. it helps me focus on my job and being able to grow a tree give me a satisfaction feeling. i only hope you can give free access for the social part. i would love to play and compare it with my friends. it might motivate me to plant more trees,1
Good,1
great if you can't or struggle to focus,1
"Nice app with really good features, some of which are customizable. I like the option to set a time/distance goal to consider my new habit a success. It works be nice but would like the goal to be set to what the goal is. Ex: 30min of yoga is the goal, yet it comes up as 0 for you to type in daily. It would be great for it so be at the goal so you only have to increase our decrease it.",1
üòçüòçüëçüëç,1
"Greatest app for this generation lol 350 rs lifetime purchase is an absolute steal lmaooooo Couldn't believe it, they are a Chinese company so probably doing something with the data but the return I'm getting is definitely worth it! Thank you forest!!",1
The app is super cute. Everytime you finished a set of deep work you can get a plant or a tree depends on what you set. And now I have a beautiful garden.,1
Super,1
good to concentrate,1
goated app for productivity,1
it has helped me to stay focused,1
üëç,1
Installed today itself and I was much more productive today as compared to my usual routine. This app Helps a ton! Do install it!!,1
best study focus app,1
ease of use.,1
This app is pretty good at least in my experience.,1
"I've used many productivity apps before for my studies, but so far this app is the one that really helped me the most. it's minimalistic design and features help me from spending too much time on the app instead of actually doing my work, but its not too simple that it's boring. the feature i love the most is the way your plants die if you leave the app, which can save you so much time if you deal with smartphone addiction. it feels rewarding, and i definitely think this app is worth the try!",1
its calming and it helps me focus a lot. I like how they added stopwatch and the sounds and different tree's are really fun. It's really helped me focus on studying for exams and tests! üòÅ,1
"I was using this app for free and it was great, the customization wasn't very good so I paid the ‚Ç¨4.50 for the premium version. I did this so I could focus on specific subjects and make my own tags. I don't get any adds, I didn't even when I was using it for free surprisingly enough. The paid version allows you to see how much study you're doing and your study path. It's a one of purchase and I would recommend.",1
"A great app for focusing, which is simple but generally works well. I like the details like being able to earn coins from focusing and buy different trees, and I also think its great that you can swap from the stopwatch to the timer mode. The Pro version is also very affordable and is just a one-time purchase to unlock even more features and generally make the app more exciting and useful.",1
"There is so much I love about this app - the stopwatch function is great for me and having the option to toggle between the timer and the stopwatch is so useful. I also love the attention to detail - the 10 seconds to cancel in case you planted by accident, the different types of trees looking more beautiful the longer you focus. I also love that the elixir doesn't feel like cheating if you choose to purchase it - you still get the little buzz of earning your coins.",1
"I personally find this app very helpful. I love the little plants, and it really helps motivate me to get off my phone and study, so that cute little plant grows. It's so satisfying to see a full garden; I just feel so proud. I love the layout of this app, it's so simplistic and easy to navigate. Overall, AMAZING app, but I would just loooveeee it if there was an option so several people (friends and stuff) could work on the same garden. Or an option to play lo-fi music. Lovely app!",1
"Excellent app for your virtual focus on your work. It gives a timer, it gives reminder , it gives exceeded time and also to the most exciting thing that it's like a normal game! It has its own coins to unlock new types of plants and trees and other things.",1
"I've set my study time for 20 min. I wish an alarm would go off to notify me when 20 min is up, that way I know to go for a quick break before starting the timer again. Otherwise the app is great, it's like a little reward and helps me stay focused.",1
"This app is so good! But I would like to suggest a feature. Add types of land in the next update, like mesa, marsh, tundra, etc. Adding a flowing river, brook or a waterfall would be an icing on the cake! Also add species of plants suitable to the terrain like, more cacti, dense grass or bamboo, snowy pines w.r.t the landforms mentioned above. This would be more interesting than planting varieties of plants on the same landform, that is forest. I hope to see this update soon!",1
So annoying that so much more stuff is now a premium feature (like choosing which apps to lock during intense study mode) but the app is supporting a good cause and other than that it still works great. You still have plenty of features and options with the free version. I'm genuinely considering buying from the elixr shop to eventually help support the planting of real trees,1
"There's somethings that can help the app be perfect, like: - notification even when my smartphone is on ""do not disturb"" - pause the timer (sometimes you have to interrupt the session to something urgent) Overall, the app is amazing. The idea of planting a forest is great. You also can change the trees. You have a timer and it saves progress. And last, ads are acceptable. Thank you!",1
"Truly enjoy this app, been using it for months. Its on constantly with a teacher and college student. It's appealing to me to be able to see my progress and my dedication over time. Definitely a motivator - I didn't dedicate all that time to give up now. I recently upgraded to premium because I feel like the developers have put sufficient time and effort so why not if I enjoy it. Although, now I'm unable to double my coins after a session which is unfortunate.",1
"You receive satisfying rewards for staying off your phone, building positive reinforcement for off-screen time. It has an adjustable time scale which corresponds to the reward you receive, so it can be as convinient as you desire. I love it, it has really helped me so much with getting past hard work deadlines, and just focusing on certain tasks in general. 11/6 much recommendedüëç",1
"Nice little pomodoro-based motivator... simple enough to stick with, but fun enough to play around with. I personally would like to see more coins per session in order for faster customization, without having to shell out the 99¬¢ for a very temporary ""speed"" potion... but I still enjoy the premise.",1
"Does (more or less) what it says. I got the 'pro' version, which costs about $2. This grants some of my favorite features: 1. Plant with friends - one gets distracted, everyone has a whithered tree. 2. The app notices when you use another app and whithers your tree. It has built-in notification forgiveness (no penalty for something you didn't initiate) and a customizable list of apps that you ""Allow"" yourself to access. Note: came back to rate this again. The bug that was annoying me is fixed.",1
This app is fairly effective at gamifying my approach to staying focused. They have also taken care with features to make my user experience smooth and return control to me. I went ahead and purchased for some of the additional features because the price was very reasonable for the continued work they are putting in. One thing I think would be great if they could keep it as minimal and simple as the rest of the app is to let me customize self tracking that I have to do with the tagging.,1
"I really like this app so far! I do wish there were a few more choices for plants in the beginning, just so you can have them represent different tasks. Two is a little limited and it takes a lot of time (and focus!) to earn coins for other plants. But i guess that's also good motivation. Fun app for staying focused :)",1
"I have been using this app for a little over a year now and i have really enjoyed it. I'm very particular about timing and tracking, i like being organized, and this app helps me to be organized when i feel too lazy to do it myself. I do have one problem though, i wish i could put multiple tags on a tree. For example, if im in a study group with some people (who arent distracting me much haha) i would like to put my two tags, social and school, on there but i can't. Thank you, I love this app :)",1
Our mobile devices and technology are only going to get more and more advanced to the point that we can't live without them (barring oxygen). This app understands that. But it trains you to be with your phone without being controlled by it. It shows you that it is possible. This is a skill and habit that we all need as we progress forward as humanity. Amazing concept!,1
The best,1
A very helpful app for those who struggle in studying regularly,1

Love this app. I just wish it stayed on top of other apps. I use my phone for work and it would be help me focus more.,1

"This app is great, closest I've found to what I want! But I wish there was an option to add ""goals"" instead of just ""habits"" and give the goals a bit more options for their completion and reminders. Sure, I want to have the habit of eating healthy lunches, but I also want to record my goal of losing a certain amount of weight over a few months. :)",1
The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.,1
"Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended. Only concern is I'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue I have (not sure it's real yet, but if it is I'm concerned). Otherwise five stars.",1

been great so far,1
Nice,1
It's fine for the free version,1
Simple user interface. Easy to use and super helpful if you want to start and keep a new habit. Thanks for the team behind it. keep up the good work.,1
I wish it sent me push notifications but it does what I needed :),1
"Very simple to use, no fancy, uneccesary features. Just tracks your chosen habits flexibly and shows your metrics.",1
Great app. But the reminder alarms are not working. After i open the app i am getting reminders all at once (not at the scheduled time) . Look into it pls. I love the app. Not leaving it . But would like smooth functioning.,1
Simple & easy app for tracking,1
I really love this app so far it has been very valuable to me . My only complaint atm is that I can not check off days on the widget,1
very useful and interesting concept. well executed design. there is a bit of confusion with controls - it takes some time to learn the right way of entering and editing data.,1
"I really like it so far. I've considered paying just a little to unlock the premium features, but I'm waiting to see how helpful this app is. I mean, my biggest obstacle is myself, so I want to see if this app helps me overcome my own bad habits.",1
"An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does. Constant reminders to rate the app, very annoying. Need some mechanism to opt out of these or a way for company to register that review has been completed",1
In the calender view of the habit the graphs are difficult to understand so instead simply show a pie chart with 3 entries 1.no of successful days 2.no of fail days 3.skip days(on which user forget/misses to use app) in a month. Also show longest streak and current streak in big/ highlight mode.,1
"App is great. Helps me keep track of my daily habits. I like how the interface is simple and easy to use. However, I've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget.",1
The app syncs data across multiple devices which has been handy and the premium cost is relatively inexpensive. The only major disadvantage is a lack of a checklist feature for habits.,1
"Not bad, but User Interface can be more friendly. The app also have annoying pop-up notifications. If you want to do simple things, the app can be so annoying",1
"this app works for me this app is able to be customize. I don't ""fit the box"" for most general apps. I do wish that social piece wasnt there, where you have the ability to what other are people have listed as their habit to break. I think there may be trolls getting kicks to see their obsurd habits stay at the top of this list. On a positive note you can hide this.",1
"I've had this for about 6 months now and tbh its helped me out. you're allowed 5 free habits. any more than that you have to pay but i think 5 is a great start because you dont want to bombard yourself with too many changes. its simple, easy to use...it takes awhile to form habits so be patient and honest with your entries. it'll help you see where you're failing and succeeding by %. i noticed i did habits because i didnt want to fail. now i notice i perform habits because i want to excel.",1
"It's a great tool to start, track and keep habits. Since I started using it I've been adding more habits I want to build and this app keeps me organized and reminds me of my habit goals. I get to compete wirh myself and see where I have room for improvement.",1
"This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it.",1
"I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. ü§óü§ó If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",1
"I really love this app, it helped me quit smoking but I have a few comments I would like to make 1. the badges you receive on certain days are not saved, I think it will be more motivating when you know that you are reaching milestones 2. the discussions I posted are also not saved, I would like to see my journey posts to keep me motivated as well and to also see how other people interact with them. I still love this app a lot and really recommend it",1
"So far, so good. I love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day, rather than just once a day. This has definitely helped me develop a routine. I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that.",1
"Love it. Simple. Yes/no answers asking if i did the thing. I can also include how many prompts i want, so if i missed it earlier, the app will remind me later that day again. Like ""hey, go do the thing"". I also appreciate how the calendar looks to show me which days i did the thing or DIDN'T do the thing if I'm trying to break a habit.",1
"Edit, 08-01-2021 It seems the apps work properly now, I have been able to log into my account and restore the habit that I have made in the past ----My Original Review---- I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit.",1
"It's a good app. I like the encouraging reminders and memes each day. I wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking, but overall it's good. It doesn't eat my battery like the last one I tried. In fact. I'm readjusting to use in the coming year.",1
Quite nice so far! Simple to use.,1
I am still new to the app. I do like it so far. Free version seems to have what I need to get going on habit tracking,1
"I love this app, no adds. It's easy to use. You can add comments to your goals and it has reminders.",1
"Stopped using for a little bit, and my schedule went out of whack. I can't not use this app anymore. 4 stars because they keep bugging for premium purchases",1
"Very nice habit tracker,I love it",1
I'm still trying the app,1
bug free flexible tracker,1
Been using it for awhile and has truly improved my life no question about it,1
Very use fulll me,1
Amazing app except it only lets you put 5 habits before paying,1
Very helpful,1
"It does what I want it to do in a beautiful way. So I am happy with it. Sadly, the widget sometimes is not responding, so I would have to open the app to check my tasks there.",1
Would be nice to be able to group ur habits into categories,1
Simple no nonesense experience. Doesn't motovate or demotivate. Plain old fashioned bullet points. Does the job I guess.,1
"Works great for me, glad it's cloud based so I can access from tablet and phone.",1
"why it starts having forced termination everytime I open it? and needs to reopen it so I can use it properly. used to love it, but not this forced termination became a pain in the axx....",1
Helps me stay on track,1
I like this app. It helps me track my tasks. I just don't like being limited to 5.,1
"Nice App. It has help me improve in my diet, work among others habits. However, there are some bugs which need to be fixed for a better experience. For example I set a habit for only Friday, but it shows up everyday yet I only wanted it to show up on Friday. Other it would receive 5 stars",1
"App is brilliant and what I was after. I'm giving 4 stars as I feel 4.49 a month is pretty steep for what it is. You do get 5 habits for free, though, so that's fine for me and I would recommend using it!",1
"Great for tracking the development of new good habits! Not so great for training yourself out of bad habits, but still doable.",1
Swag but sharing doesnt work :(,1
"Good app, mostly easy to use but editing goals not so easy",1
Wonderful,1
"Simple to use, backup, and tons of options.",1
Just what I needed.,1
"Really good app, I've found it quite versatile (when I remember to use it). I do kind of wish it had the same name and icon as when it was HabitBull though. Whenever I'm trying to find it after a long time that's what I look up, and I only really find it by the purple bull in the images lol. That made it more distinguishable and unique to me. But maybe there are technical reasons it had to be changed, idk.",1
App does exactly what it says. Easy to use too,1
It is great but u can record only 5 habits... So...,1
"I really like this app, but the export function causes the app to break and close. Not pleased as I'm a premium customer and this severely limits the use I get from the app I paid for. Please fix and I'll happily give you 5 stars, but until that time I'm disappointed as I reported this a while ago via your in-app feedback.",1
"I like the purpose of this app, still in the process of getting to know the app more",1
"Hello, I am using this app since a week and I find it useful , started with one habit of meditating daily and it helped me to keep on track.So thank you for this. Pls help me in resolving one issue, I am not able to register and sign up by going on profile option.Also inspirational quotes are also not visible. Thanks in advance",1
"Great app, however no updates for a very long time - abandonware? üòï",1
My favorite for aesthetics and utility for having tracking. But limited to 1 count per day (e.g. taking 2 walks on the same day only credits 1 walk towards a 4-times-a-week goal.),1
"Great, widget to add on home screen tho u can mark u list or check it, u have to log bck on app, maybe if u pay u can not sure, other than tht love it!",1
Works pretty good to help you remember to do certain things and make them a habit. Encouraging to see the streak when you accomplish what you set out to do. Would have been a 5* but sometimes it attaches circles when a day didn't get done.,1
"The App is great, unfortunately (even after deleting and re-installing) the widgets only work when I restart the App which defeats the purpose of having widgets in the first place. Hope this gets fixed soon. Other than that I'm a Fan!",1
"Great app! Clear tracking, you can add notes to each day, and set multiple habits. It'll remind you to do whichever habit you are trying to form, but it doesn't flood you with notifications.",1
"Love it! Would like to see a few more details in the graphs. It would be handy if you could scroll through the weeks smoothly instead of one week at a time. The dark version of the app should be the standard imo, it looks cooler √°nd it saves power! I'd love to have a timer as an option to measure the amount of time spent on a habit. Thinking of meditation, breathing exercises.",1
"A great app overall. Complete and specific in terms of types of goals. User interface aspects like fonts and some screens like the first ""create habit"" screen seem a little heterogeneous when compared to the rest of the app; in other words, they seem displaced, out of vibe. I suggest a review of the UI; maybe making it a little less cluttery and cleaner. For example, the google fit prompts and font correlation. It is a great work nevertheless, congratulations!",1
"Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?",1
"I've just installed this app and so far, it seems like exactly what I had been looking for! Kudos. I just have one suggestion. The app exits on pressing the back button once. Most apps exit on pressing the back button twice, which works great for the user experience, in my opinion. So, it would be really great if you could incorporate that. Hoping to use this app every day!",1
"Excellent app for tracking your good/bad habits, the ""dont break the chain"" motivation technique is surprisingly effective at keeping you on point. UI/UX is simple/intuitive enough and gets the job done. One caveat is that there is no website, program, or windows app version that is available on a PC unless you use a clunky android emulator. It would be greatly appreciated to add this functionality for those of us who prefer doing most if not all our work/productivity related tasks at a computer rather than a smartphone. Adding this feature would change my 4 star rating to a 5.",1
"Con: Would have got five stars if it had come with decent instructions. The control bar icons are counter-intutive, with the cogwheel for edit and the pen for notes, in addition the calendar icons look like keyboards. Pro: All in all a good app, and the graphs, streaks and percentage displays are very useful. Start slow, three habits at most, and stick to ""yes/no"" habits until you get your head round how things work.",1
"I like the app. Have been using it for a few months now, and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track. Only drawback I've found is the inability to sync my profile - always fails with 'sync failed, make sure you have a working internet connection'. Have sent in support request, but so far no response. That aside, the app works well, and I can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary Android phone.",1
"Great app, easy to use, nice design, motivating statistics and quotes. Thank you developers for this app :). Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period). Maybe there could be an option to apply this change only to further period (e.g. when I start an activity twice a week, it becomes a habit and I want to increase it to 3 times a week and I don't want to lose/worsen previous statistics).",1
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off",1
"The simplicity is nice, but sometimes I want something with more detail. I use it in conjunction with another app. If I don't have a lot of time to enter info, it's great for that. I like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology. I do wish, though, that you could change the setup of a Habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail. Right now you have to create a new Habit if you want to change, but then that changes your stats.",1
"Really good way of tracking habits and progress (exercise and quality of baby's sleep are my uses). Only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front (even if only in the premium version perhaps). I'd like to see something like a target for average number instead of pass/fail, that'd provide an extra way of approaching habits I think. I'm picking at hairs though, it's a very good app, that does the job it advertises.",1
"I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator. It's great for a free app. We'll done to the devs on this.",1
"It's the best habit tracker out there but it's not the best it can possibly be. After a substantial amount of thought, I succumbed and shelled out the 10 euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget, which is essential to keep me on track. However, the widget doesn't respond unless the application is opened beforehand, so minus one star for that. Also, a true black widget or user-interface would be very nice for AMOLED screens, so fingers crossed for that too.",1
"Pros- This is the BEST Habit Tracking App out there! It gives you every possible option needed to set and track a habit. Very nice UI as well. Cons- 1. I'd like the font to be more bold as it's kind of hard to see. 2. The cost for the premium version is WAY TOO HIGH -_- I wouldn't spend 320 per month on a habit app. I don't spend that much even on video streaming apps. There should be options like 300 for 1 month, 650 for 3 months, 1000 for 1 year etc.",1
"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks.",1
I really love this app so far it has been very valuable to me . My only complaint atm is that I can not check off days on the widget,1
It's very simple to use. I like that you can set as either a yes/no habit or a rep like two times a day. My only hangup would be that the free version only allows tracking for five habits but that can be a bonus if your just getting started. You don't want to overwhelm yourself.,1
"This app seems to work pretty well. The user forums aren't well managed, but remain useful. Habit Tracker has never crashed on me, but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the UI has focus at the time you launch the app. Fortunately its easy to navigate.",1
"A good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life. Limited flexibility, in the free version, but sufficient four basic tracking of self-improvement efforts. Easy to get started. And so I can do without cute reminder and encouragement features, they are easy enough to toggle off.",1
"This is a great app for me. The app is easy to navigate and the motivational quotes are a nice touch. I give this app 4 stars because I have an issue with the notifications. I want the app to remind me to do a certain task a certain amount of times throughout the day, but it only sends me the notification once I open the app which defeats the purpose of the notification. Not sure if I'm the only experiencing this problem? Other than that, I use this app on the daily.",1
"Newly installed re: resolutions. Seems to be a bug on Android when I set a target date it sets it to the day after. If I go back in and change it back one day, it keeps it. Please fix. Seems like a great app. Purchased to export data because data is beautiful lol. Thank you.",1
"really effective app. best widget of all the habit tracking apps I've tried. But the widget can be a little glitchy and I wish there were a compact version. some of the UX leaves a little to be desired. I'd love to see some small improvements espec to widgets, but still definitely worth using. premium paid user.",1
"I like that the app in simple. I turned off the motivational quotes, so all I see is the calendar. And that's all I need to see! One thing I would add, though, is the ability to add exception so missed days don't count against my streak. One of my goals is a daily activity that I can only do at home. When I travel, I miss those days. But I did it every day I was able (i.e. every day I was home), so it's a bit of a downer to be penalized.",1
"The widgets look great, and i like the idea behind this app, but it feels like im fighting it to create goals where i would have to start over completely to make it a single task vs a quantity. also my biggest issue is that you cant set a quantity per week, only per day. i want to be able to set x number of hours per week doing a task without any daily requirements",1
"I love this app! My only problem are the widgets for the app. Each widget freezes after non-use for a while. When the widget freezes, I can't mark complete or incomplete update my counting numbers for any of the habits and then I have to physically open the app to update habits. After I do that, the widgets work again until the cycle repeats itself.",1
"Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit. As I am frequently adding habits, I would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them. Hopefully, this is an easy fix. Then this will be a 5-star app.",1
i suggest a positive running tab amd also a negative running tab! i love the app and it really makes a difference in tracking my daily habits. the only thing i have found that would make it better is if i could track relapses. this would require it to allow something that i do NOT want to mark for a day amd when it is marked then it would be a negative. this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse. i would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks.,1
"Great motivator to keep a habit going. Also good for keeping track of habits you already have. They have great, insightful options that help you set your goal. Tried a similar highly rated app (forgot its name) and this one destroys it. Immediately uninstalled the other one. There are a few quarks here and there they can improve, but overall I really like this app and have recommended kt to friends and family.",1
"Excellent app. Does everything you want a habit tracking app to do. Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that. So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day. For example, if I am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks, the app will show me as less than 100% successful until I indicate today is successful. Need to fix that.",1
"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable.",1
"the app has helped me track my habits and create new better habbits. i have been 7 weeks drinking nothing but water and have been on and off with candy and snacks. just like any other habit tracking app, this will not do the work for you. it is here to hell you keep track of the work you are putting forth, and it does a good job at that.",1
"Somehow, a simple concept that's effectively just a fancy stopwatch has helped immensely with my studying, reading, writing, and productivity in general. This app helps motivate me to a degree I haven't had in ages. It's extemely nice being able to go back and see detailed stats of what I did. An easy 5 stars.",1
"This is a very well built habit tracker. Very flexible settings and easy to use. The main downside is that the app is not being developed anymore. The Pro version is reasonably priced, although some (not me) have had issues transferring between devices. I also hear support is non-existent.",1
"Really good app, I've found it quite versatile (when I remember to use it). I do kind of wish it had the same name and icon as when it was HabitBull though. Whenever I'm trying to find it after a long time that's what I look up, and I only really find it by the purple bull in the images lol. That made it more distinguishable and unique to me. But maybe there are technical reasons it had to be changed, idk.",1
"I would like to set the begin date in the past, then indicate the total number of days and have app calculate end date. i would like to see the end date on calendar, number of days remaining, and an option to have days marked complete as the default. also, stop asking me to rate when i already have please.",1
"Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size.",1
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.",1
"This is a good way to track one habit. It is fun and motivating. More than one habit and my screen became a little crazy, jumping randomly from one habit to another. All in all, it's been fun to use and I'm on day 14 straight of my no complaining challenge!",1
I bought the premium version of this app. It is easy to use and I love the reminders sent to my Galaxy watch to keep me on track. I would like bolder colour coding to differentiate the goals being tracked and success/failure indicators. Overall a great purchase.,1
"this app has really helped me work on some habits! I appreciate that it reminded me if I didn't enter information for a day. I would have liked features like setting a time for those messages, or cool sounds when I click that I've done something, but for a free app, this was good enough as it was!",1
Trial version which despite limitations is pretty good. Only thing is that I wish the alarm clock was easily accessible or instructions on how to reset is available on the guide. Have recommended the app to friends.,1
"Really good at what it does, but I've asked for support for what seem to be glitches transferring data between devices twice and gotten nothing back. That's frustrating.",1
The interface could use some improvements and it would be helpful to have a few additional methods of tracking goal progress but the app is otherwise great. They send reminder notifications to help you keep on track but aren't overbearing with them.,1
"Used it for two years but now that I changed phones, I somehow can't easily migrate all the data over. I swear I did it before but even signing up for the premium trail failed me... Personally, if it's not super easy to do I don't find it worth. Especially if I had to pay.",1
"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!",1
"It's simple to use: you don't need to be a coder to figure it out. I like that there's a message board. I am considering using it to form a support group so I can stay on track with my workouts. Also, I didn't realize there are a lot of people who hate themselves for masturbating lol. But it's good they can find support in the message board. I read that you can only have 5 habits you can track. I'm being pragmatic and starting out with 4. But eventually I will need more than 5.",1
"I love habit bull. I did not expect to feel connected to people when I purchased this app but that is what happened. Realising that other people have challenges with habits made me feel, alive, like I was not alone. I only wish the reminders would play on continuously like an alarm, because sometimes I forget to check things off.",1
"Pretty good at what it does, exactly what I needed. However, there is a small bug - weekly review widget does not show all my habits. Moreover, I miss a feature to periodically share my weekly/monthly reviews on social media, or with at least with someone. Accountability helps.",1
"Great for progress. Their motivation quotes stopped working. Plus it doesn't remember which habit you were last viewing... so a ""weekly"" intrusive display. I specifically looked for this app. Because it's simple and easy on the eyes. Uninstalled because habitbull wasn't shutting down properly and kept making notification sounds.",1
"This is by far my favorite habit tracking app (and I've tried many). I like the weekly view. (I have an unusual use for this app.....I use it to track my kids' school work and I like the weekly view so I can see what they have completed during the week). However, I'm not sure if this app is still being supported? The last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries. But the app does still work well.",1
"1) There's a corrupted image file failing to display under my weekly view. No idea what it is. 2) The widget stops responding to touch unless resized or the app is opened manually. I use Lawnchair 2. Pixel 4a. Love the app, not sure if it's still being updated though. Thanks for all you've done!",1
"App is very useful and is exactly what I need, I just find the layout to be a little complicated. I wish there was an option of a simple checklist of what I need to do today, but instead it's a calender layout with the full weeks of things to do. Apart from that the app is ideal",1
"Habitbull is great. I love how customizable it is for making different types of habits. Tracking my current streak is great for motivating me to keep on going. And even if I break my streak, I love that it shows my ""best score"" so I have a new goal to reach. The only thing I would suggest is having a ""user suggestions"" button in the settings. I have emailed about a new type of habit a couple times and have never heard anything back. User feedback is always good for making a great app even better",1
"In general, this app helps me keep track of my habits, which is great; however, the app has quite a few bugs, even after buying the premium version, which is disappointing. The sync function doesn't work at all and I don't see any effort to fix these issues. This is one of the rare apps where I won't be giving a 5 star review.",1
Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.,1
"This is a super cool and helpful app. I love it. My only criticism is that it could be a bit more user friendly... it's easy to set up habits you want to DO (drink 8 glasses water per day) but harder to set up ""I only want this many ___ per week"". Additionally, the funny reminders are funny... because they're ridiculous. I don't think an English speaker wrote them, but I can't convince myself to disable them because they're so strange. üòÇ",1
"this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though",1
"overall it gets the job done, but the notifications are confusing to set and are inconsistent when reminding you about your about. Some days I'm reminded and some I'm not, so it's kinda been up to me to remind myself. but the app itself is easy to use and effective at tracking.",1
Still the best app of it's kind even though it hasn't had an update since 2018. The widgets/unlimited habit tracking made the premium version worthwhile for me. Ideally the interface/reminder system would be a little slicker and it could do with the odd usability tweak like letting you fully edit the habits after creating them.,1
"Great app, provides you with the accountability to help achieve your goals. Please add in the feature, upon completing a goal, to be able to automatically input the number that was necssary for being successful to save time manually entering it. Gets kind of annoying especially if you have a lot of tracked goals.",1
"I like the interface of this app, is simple and beautiful but I find it expensive to charge a recurring subscription for it considering the only Premium feature is to add more than 5 habits, whish it was only a one time buy. Also, they should add an option to reset an habit to a particular date instead of having to delete and habit and add it again to start on that day.",1
"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app.",1
Great app for succeeding with your good habits. The widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits. I also like the discussion page but I miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post/comment was posted. Sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it.,1
great habit tracking app and you get plenty without premium. I like the premium widgets quite a bit and the extra habits. Would be better if it had the option to flag a habit as skipped rather than fail without breaking the chain for when you can't do it. E.g. In bed early when you have to stay back late at work.,1
"Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it.",1
"The only app I'll ever use for to-do anything. Simple, customizable, great as a calendar, you can organize things to a point where it's almost insane if you choose, (imo) intuitive UI and shortcuts, enough options to suit pretty much anyone's needs. It's great without the monthly sub but I still have it because it's cheap ($2.99) and I use the app daily. The only things I would like added are more theme options and a way to ""complete"" recurring tasks, but that's a nitpick at this point lol.",1
"I really love this app! I got it so that I can keep myself focused when I'm doing homework and studying for school, but I use it for so many other things! My favorite is using it while I'm crocheting or reading so that I don't get distracted by social media. This is the only app that I've ever liked enough to buy the full version! I do have one suggestion - I like to plant trees when I go to bed, but the longest they grow for is 3 hours. I think the stopwatch shouldn't have a maximum time.",1
"Awesome, helpful, cute app! It has just the right incentive for me, collecting and growing cute plants, to reprogram how I use my phone and focus on being more productive. It's helped me so much. Setting my phone down and ignoring it for 2-3hr chunks is now a habit, not defaulting to scrolling any kind of app or media, not defaulting to distraction, is becoming more of a habit. This app has been a vital tool in this, thank you guys so much. Was happy to buy full version and exclusives I love!",1
Great aap,1
It has degloved my concerntration,1
"Everything is great about this app but I... just don't feel that concerned about trees? It feels like playing Farmville after a while & I'd prefer Petville vibes! If instead of trees, users could get an option to own a pet that grows with time & starts playing + developing a family of its own, I would be 30x more motivated to keep the dog alive (by avoiding phone usage) so that it can have its family one day. Pls introduce this option if it's possible to do so? It'll make your app the best one!",1
I used this app back in 2019.The app crashed back then and i lost my progress and motivation. Reusing it now. Would like to point out the same hight of shrubs and tree which doesn't look good.,1
It increases my productivity and awareness in my life and study. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä,1
very usefull for focusing on study,1
I find it useful and interesting,1
"Very good, allows for less distraction but you have to pay for most of the features",1
"I would like to have a request, the app is overall very good but i is missing a small component it would be better if there was a pause option awailable during the time the plant is growing as most likely no-one would be able to do the same work for hour's without break and they need to have a chance to take one , and it s only plausible if there is a pause option",1
"I absolutely love Forest. As a lazy not-get-anything-done person, this really helps me focus on what Im supposed to do. My only complaint is that a lot of the features are premium and I cant afford premium so it would be nice if there are a few more free features. but overall, the app is amazingg",1
Definitely increased my productivity and I love the reward of seeing those cute trees grow. I love the app design but I wish there were more trees to unlock without paying.,1
"Love the app, great for revision and concentration. It's a shame that it doesn't kill the plant if I go onto other apps though.",1

"There's an amount of nice looking trees that need a paid currency (or alternatively if you have friends you can get some), it would be nice if there was some other way. But there is also lots of trees requiring a lot of coins too so that'll keep me busy enough, guess you need money from somewhere because premium was really cheap considering. It's a nice motivational timer for all sorts.",1
Cool and calm pleasant forest rain makes us to focus more for the reason why we have started it and avoiding distractions to reach out next minute away goal that's by practice possible even more with better environment by this app ..... More of a game thing which hits ur dopamine while studying too...,1
"I honestly don't review apps on Google but this made me say, if you are someone trying to maintain a study schedule and not procrastinate, this is it.. I myself am a high school student, and this is very effective if you have deadline over your head for completion of syllabus/homework.. Even tho the membership is reasonable, it wouldn't have hurt if the planting real trees was free of cost but I believe it is pretty understandable why they didn't give it for free, other than that, it's perfect!!",1
"It's a good app but I feel I'm not getting the value for my money. I suggest that at the end of each timer the phone should vibrate, this is because most times I do forget to check the app, and even when I remember it can be a bit distracting which literally nullifies the purpose of the app which is to help people focus. At the end of a planting session the phone should vibrate to remind the user that the session has ended. I'd very much appreciate it if vibration can be incorporated in the app.",1
"This app is extremely useful,consistently using for past 3 months.Also bought pro version too.., still few features would just make it perfect.. 1. A pause ‚è∏Ô∏è button should be available in stopwatch mode. 2. A third mode for manual time logging should be introduced,as many students don't prefer to to put device in front, instead uses a physical stopwatch for calculating time focused, thus this time can be tracked in app too. 3.Sadly the app can't be used in landscape mode in tablet...",1
"Edit: 3 years ago I wrote a german comment because I wasn't good in english but now I'm better and can give good feedback. I still like this app. With the deep focus function that I can turn on or off, I can control how focused I can be without drifting into the deep, endless hole of social media. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that I have to be pro to have a white list. But I mostly use this to track time and to not use my phone, so this is fine for me :)",1
Forest is for stay focused. It works good in terms of basic use and knowing your actual focused hour but also irritates when it show adds. Overall good üëç i like it.,1
I used this app back in 2019.The app crashed back then and i lost my progress and motivation. Reusing it now. Would like to point out the same hight of shrubs and tree which doesn't look good.,1
"Love this app, paid for full and very worth it. My only issue is that if I plug my phone in to charge while it's in use, it kills the tree automatically. Bummer when the tree is at like 90 minutes. I've done all the tips it says for pixels, with adaptive charging and all that, none of it has solved the problem. Besides that, it would be 5 stars!",1
"Forest, in its core concept, is awesome. However, I would like, even, use it when I am having a good time, like gaming, not only studying. Besides, the developers could've made a wider range of trees, for example, I use forest a lot to focus, by it, I earn too many coins and I am able to buy all trees in no time. Cutting a long story short, it is almost perfect ( in my opinion of course), but it needs a little more work on it :)",1
"Great app! Motivational and helps you to get your things done. One thing is that the price of the plants are too high. I don't know, it may vary person to person, but I am a lazy person, so maybe I'm getting fewer coins every time I complete a goal. In all, very good app. I'm using it before my exams and it helps very much. Also, too many features are in premium. Leave a little for us too!",1
"First of all it's great it has a timer which you can choose the amount of time. If it had a pause feature it would be great . Second , you feel guilty and remorseful when you quit studying or whatever you we're supposed to since a tree won't be planted. Third , it has various trees that improve focus cause it looks good Ima work for it. Thirdly the app blocking feature called Deep focus . Helps a lot you can't open apps . Although if you need an app for studying you need a subscription. Bye ‚ô•Ô∏è",1
"I've been using this app for about 4 months and it's almost perfect. As a software developer myself I'd like to suggest a couple of additions. Please, remove the ""are you sure you want (...)"" dialog box when i want to stop a stopwatch session or at least make a toggle setting for it. Also, remove the dialog box when you switch between timer and stopwatch mode, you dont need all the details every time you switch. I think with these kind of changes the app would be very very close to perfection.",1
"Great and cute app. I think this would work great for someone who needs multiple times a day of focus to fill the garden. With only one thing per day to focus on, my garden looks empty. One thing I don't like is that it doesn't show how many cycles you have done unless you go to a different tab 'forest' to see.",1
"Really great app. Keeps me focused and off the phone. Recently I found an option which lets us plant real trees with the points we've earned. This feature is locked behind a paywall, which is crazy! I don't mind any other feature locked behind a paywall, but this should be made free to all.",1
"It's a really cool app that having it just run helps me stay motivated. But I don't think it's working the way it's supposed to. I can still tab out and watch a YT vid with the tree still growing in the background. It growing helps me stay motivated, but it's not giving me the incentive like the app describes.",1
it's a great app only wish that the free version has more types of trees as it used to be more than 120 min,1
"Excellent app...but I would love if they get the timer for more time, like for 180 mins or more Thank you",1
cool app for pomodora technique,1
Would love to see some widgets for timers.,1
Forest is for stay focused. It works good in terms of basic use and knowing your actual focused hour but also irritates when it show adds. Overall good üëç i like it.,1
Good,1
"Nice App, But it can be More Productive if the Total time was shown in hours and minutes also... And make the App some more Aesthetic ...",1

Very helpful for focusing on the study and my other works.,1
"Great and cute app. I think this would work great for someone who needs multiple times a day of focus to fill the garden. With only one thing per day to focus on, my garden looks empty. One thing I don't like is that it doesn't show how many cycles you have done unless you go to a different tab 'forest' to see.",1
My favorite app to focus üíô I would give it 4 only because when I invite my friends from the app it crashes within a min,1
Definitely increased my productivity and I love the reward of seeing those cute trees grow. I love the app design but I wish there were more trees to unlock without paying.,1
It's a great app!..,1
its seams impossible to unlock other trees but overall great idea,1
sahi hai bhai not bad,1
"Really great app. Keeps me focused and off the phone. Recently I found an option which lets us plant real trees with the points we've earned. This feature is locked behind a paywall, which is crazy! I don't mind any other feature locked behind a paywall, but this should be made free to all.",1
"The file size is 120 MBs this is large, can you reduce it somehow??",1
Good app,1
"the idea behind this app is super cool, and it has legitimately helped me in my life. it provides you with a good incentive to focus and rewards you for doing so. that said, one issue i have with it is that if you don't pay for it, the unlock process is extremely slow; i've been using it for about a week and a half and i'm not even half of the way to unlocking one thing.",1
helps to focus on studying ü§å,1
"I like this application, features are too good to explain. But please fix the problem of login- whenever i try to login to my account and click on the ""sing up and login"" button in settings it shows only premium membership ad but doesn't show any option to login or sing up.üôèplease fix this",1
very nice but thw othwr cgoice of.plants are overpriceda bit,1
Effective,1
I wanted to express my appreciation for the app. I find it to be an excellent tool and have thoroughly enjoyed using it.,1
Would really be good to have a widget to start the timer without having to open the app,1
Aesthetic and good app for focusing ‚ú®Ô∏è,1
awesome app.,1
This app helps me focus and romanticize learning even though I used to hate studying.,1
"Helps focus well, and is fun to use.",1
I wish it had an alarm or notified the user when the time was over,1
Such an amazing app But why do I have pay Pro version so I can focus much as I want That's not Fair!,1
ŸàÿßŸà,1
It's really helpful if you can't organize yourself to complete with your study time,1
Helps you focus,1
"Love the app, great for revision and concentration. It's a shame that it doesn't kill the plant if I go onto other apps though.",1
Amazing app for focusing on studies or any time work,1
"i've been using it for a few weeks now and enjoy it (using the free version). i would give it five stars but as someone who gets frustrated when rewards get harder to achieve, im a tad annoyed by the trees costing more in coin value every time i unlock one. i use this to help me track how long homework is taking me per day and i like getting new trees, just wish they were always 500 coins bc it keeps it a more tangible goal whereas 700 coins is sssooo far away. have been debating going premium...",1
"Definitely helps me study. I've bought premium and I've enjoyed the app a lot. The only criticism I have is that when you're growing a tree stopping the timer early kills it. Often times ill set a timer and then finish early, but I've still got 20 minutes where my phone is completely useless. Yes, I could pay the 60 coins to remove the withered trees, but that makes my past hour of studying completely useless. You should be able to stop early and keep whatever trees you have managed to grow.",1
"It's really useful as I can use any tree and keeps me motivated to do my tasks. It's really peaceful app for people that just need to get off their phones. Not to mention that choice is yours on what to do. So I am grateful for that On there other hand, most of the extra stuff is behind a pay wall. As well as most trees, audios, and such as other stuff. Not to mention, it's only two hours and I wish it had more than that. But other than that, it is a good app for a timer and rest.",1
"I have premium version. Great app, however have a few minor issues.  1) Since the last version watching ads to double coins is not working. Ad just does not show up. 2) The Planting Reminder does not work at all. I have never received any notification. I have given all the permissions required, and also verified that notifications are not suppressed.  3) As a developer to developer, loading trees in Store is just too slow. Don't expect a simple GET to be that slow. :)",1
"I really like this app, and I love that I can give the focus points I earn to grow real trees! But in order to unlock new virtual trees, you also have to spend focus points? That sucks. Maybe create two kinds of earnable currency??? Because it makes it feel wrong to spend your points on new trees, and that's a really fun and original aspect of the app. Please give multiple currencies!!!",1
"I really enjoy using this app. It's a great way to remind myself not to play on my phone when I should be working on other things. My only complaint is that there isn't a free account available for syncing your forest to the cloud it using it across multiple devices. I wish they could make it free to connect to Facebook, or something of that nature, so trees won't be lost if a phone needs resetting or replacing.",1
"I write this after the first use and yes! I will be using this for studying, cleaning and what ever else I need to focus on. I love the art and simplicity of this app. The unlock of different trees makes this into a little game as a side bonus. If I try to roam into different apps on my phone it will tell me to get back to business. *they took away the unlock trees* Paying for the nice looking trees is something I won't do. Not happening but the app still works well and does as stated above.",1
"Overall, I have loved to use this whenever I'm unconsciously procrastinating. It gives you stats on how many trees you've grown, how many you've killed, and how many minutes you've focused in days, weeks, months, and years. My only issue is recently a glitch has surfaced. It says I can not play the ad to double my coins, which really sucks because I want cuter trees.",1
This app is a great help keeping me on task at work or on projects. I recommend that anyone with focus issues give it a try. Only issue I've encountered so far is that on occasion it will let you pull up the internet without giving you a warning or killing your tree. But this seems to be rare and never happens if you have recently pulled up the app itself to see how much time you have left.,1
"Works great! Keeping the tree alive is an excellent way too keep me focused! If I could ask for just one thing: add musical white noise options to the store (for instance, like the Tide timer app's Muse and Air sounds). Those can get me to focus better than ocean waves and whatnot. If you could add that, I'll definitely bump my rating up to 5 stars!",1
The overview window definitely needs to be polished. It can be hard to understand at times. There have been times where I plant one tree on a certain day but two will show up (no I'm not in week or month view the trees have identical stats). The app is pretty nice overall and it helps me stay on track. I just think it needs to be polished and overhauled a tiny bit,1
"I used it and it was awesome, one thing that I would like to see eventually is the ability to use some pro options after you have used the app for a while (say 100 non-withered trees) or have enough points because I currently have no way to purchase pro to text during. I just would like to see some limited version of pro you can unlock after a while of use.",1
"Do you wish you were more productive with your down time? I have the Pro version so I can plant trees, unlock achievements, and track how I use my free time. I love the ability to ""whitelist"" apps like music so I can jam while I do my chores or drive places. I have my tags listed with things I want to do more of like dance moves, doing a workout, or spending a reasonable time gaming before I do something else. Plus it helps me focus on the stuff I don't wanna do like paperwork but with plants!",1
"Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",1
"Update: Could we please have the option to keep snow effects after the holidays? It looks so pretty. Nice gamification. Lately, the sound effects continue after closing the app, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Now I lost all my unlocked trees which is a bummer. This is the second time I've lost everything.",1
"It really helps! This simple app helps me keep on track. 4 stars because you can't change the amount of time for each tree. ETA: I've found a workaround. You can select ""Counting exceeded time"" in Settings. That way the time recorded is the actual time you stay focused, not the default 25 minutes.",1
"this is a really good app that I definitely recommend, especially the pro version. it gives so many more options and it's a one time payment of like 3 dollars. the only issue I have is that there isn't a type of pause or break button. this would be helpful since things can happen and u might need to stop, but besides that it's a very good app!",1
"Great, but one big flaw. I love this app and its great for productivity, but I work off my tablet with a keyboard, meaning I put it in landscape mode. Unfortunately, this app is only in upright mode, so any time I have to set a timer or adjust my settings/tree selection, it defaults into that mode and I have to either turn my head or adjust my whole tablet. Please, if it's at all possible, I would LOVE to have this work in landscape mode and change my review to 5/5.",1
"I have a major issue in concentrating. I get distracted easily and am often times completely unmotivated. With this, I have to say that this app is oddly helpful. It's rewarding to see the trees pop up so I guess it works, at least for me. Not being able to use the phone or else the tree dies is absolutely brilliant. I can sit on my phone all day but this makes me put it down and try to focus.",1
"I like how simple this game is! It's easy to use, the graphics are cute and I'm prevented from using my phone whenever I grow a tree. I would prefer, however, if there were more variety in the plants since you get used to all of them after a while. Also, a lot of the other features like the achievements and such are limited for f2p players so that was a little disappointing. But other than that, it serves its purpose well!",1
"I love this app so much! It helps me stay focused and on task while I'm in class and at home studying. I recommend this for any student struggling to put down the phone and focus on school! The reward system is amazing and I can wait to unlock more plants as i progress. As a nature lover, I live for the idea of helping out the REAL life environment aswell, which is an amazing feature of this app. The only down side is that it sometimes crashes, which is frustrating but I can get past that.",1
"Update: They fixed the issue and I was finally able to login again. My history of trees planted is still there and all looks good. The app has always been great to use, I just have fingers crossed the good quality stays!! Previous: I haven't been able to the use the app (the pro version I paid for) for weeks bc there is no way to login with an error. I don't even care about the tree change. I cannot login!! This is honestly ridiculous and borderline a scam.",1
"This is a good app and I've been using it without problem for a couple of months. However, like it's been stated in recent reviews, since the last update, the trees are not dying when you use other apps and no notification appears to remind you that the trees are still growing. The problem seems to be with the Whitelist feature. When I turn Whitelist off, the app works perfectly, but with Whitelist on, I can access apps that are not on the Whitelist. Hope the team fixes this. Thanks.",1
"Awesome app! Helps keep me focused, the friends feature keeps me accountable, and it let's you track your time to really measure your productivity. Only flaw is that we can't use phone and computer at the same time without duplicating results. I get distracted by both computer and phone apps. I also think we should be able to see the trends of our sessions on the PC. The tree store should also be accessible on PC. Otherwise, highly recommend.",1
"Hey. Just got the premium version of this app because I really liked the concept. It seems to still be in its earlyish stages at the moment so I was just going to do a running review: Very unique concept, very cute and simple graphics. It makes me super motivated to get focused, which is exactly what I need at the moment ____ The app isn't super user friendly right now, but I have an extensive background in tech, so I'm able to use the app pretty efficiently. Only have noticed a very very few bugs right now. But again, these are my initial thoughts after a couple minutes of use. It's not impossible to use. Probably just requires a basic understanding of how to operate apps. I think there's a tutorial in the settings",1
"This is a great and effective app for focusing, I use it for breaking my habit of using my phone at night and while studying. The only things I'd like to add are that it is difficult to get enough coins to purchase new plants (which isn't really a big deal) and that the rewarded ads never work. The ads are always delayed and frozen so I never choose to watch them. I would also suggest adding a pomodoro timer to the app. Overall an excellent tool for focusing! Definitely reccomend.",1
"Love using it to track how much time I have been working and visually see how I am spreading my projects out over time. Two issues drive me nuts, though. The ability to listen to sounds needs fixing. I like to put on the background sound while working but constantly shuts off, meaning I waste time going back to the app to restart the sound. The Google Chrome add on won't sync either.",1
"The idea of Forest is great, but there is one major flaw. Even though I fully turned on the setting that would allow the app to stop me from using other apps, it didn't work. I was tempted to scroll social media and play games instead of focus, and the app let me do that. Despite me not focusing, my tree grew fine and the data at the end of the timer showed nothing. I really hope this gets fixed because it would work great for me without the mistake.",1
"The idea is great. I've used it many times to stay focused and stay on task. I enjoy the fact that you can write lil bios of on your trees. However, the app would be tremendously more useful if I were able to restrict certain apps for a period of time rather than not using my phone at all. I still want to use certain apps, like music and reading apps, rather than not having access to my phone at all.",1
"I love this app so much, it helps me stay focused and is cute and visually appealing. I had one problem. The trees that you grow change their looks the longer u can stay focused. But it's like it requires u to stay focused the whole 120 minutes before u can grow your tree to it's full capacity. Considering this is listed as a pomodoro app I'd have thought that you can add breaks every 25 minutes. It's really sad and dettering. I wish it had breaks u can adjust it to.",1
"Very good app for focus, has helped me on more than one occasion. I will say though, the audio it plays, if you choose to play it, sometimes glitches out on my Galaxy S9. It will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on. Otherwise though, its a very good focus app, great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones.",1
"Absolutely love the app. The graphics are marvelous. However, the only tweak that should be made in my opinion is for the timer to be atleast 3 hours longer.I understand people could take advantage of that, because some could do it while sleeping. But with the pandemic, 5 hours would be nice maybe 7 for people doing school. The phone for me has been extremely distracting for me . This app helps me heavily but when the timer is only 2 hours MAX. I inevitably take advantage of this. Distractionüò©",1
"Perfect when paired with the right water bottle -- Dont JUST use the app, actually buy a water bottle to keep nearby you so you have a visual reminder (and no excuse not to drink). The app by itself is great but definitely needs more reminder settings and general motivation for the free users, or give ways to purchase individual parts of it all; i.e. a single personality for example. It is a shame that the best parts of the motivation side feel locked behind the paywall, and $9 a month adds up",1
"I love this app! It's so fun to plant a forest and now all I want to do is work and study to make my forest denser! The only things I would change is that there is no pause button and sometimes I'll be 30 minutes into an hour session and I'll have something unavoidable come up but if I stop the timer, my tree will wither. I also can't figure out how to turn off the ambience without restarting my phoneüòÖ otherwise a fantastic app!!!",1
"I have the pro version and it's a great little app, but I wish there was a blacklist feature instead of just a whitelist feature. I regularly find myself needing certain apps for work that I didn't realize and I have to wait for the time to run out. If there was a blacklist feature though, I could just ban only the apps I procrastinate the most with.",1
"The only negative feedback is the sound to select each thing is annoyingly loud and I wish you could silence it, I mean pressing the plant, and ending the plant timer really makes me jump and I have to take out my headphones to not have it hurt, and even then I can hear it through my headphones that are beside me. Other than the silencing issue, it's wonderful",1
"I love this app so much, I've had it for almost a week and I've only found one bad thing about it. It's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so. Overall it's super fun :) Edit September 2020: there was a new update limiting the trees you can purchase using coins without paying for premium, there are only a handful of trees available to buy at this and it just doesn't make it as fun as it used to be.",1
"so far so good and almost perfect app, it really helps me stay focused by reminding me to go back to the app whenever I leave, pro features are definitely worth purchasing. One more addition I'll like to see is the ability to sett up a timer chain like let's say 25mins-5minbreak-25mins so I don't have to manually go on a break and then back into another session all the time",1
"I love this app, and it is super helpful for productivity. I know it's probably not the developers fault, but losing all my hard work earning trees just bc I switched from apple to Android really sucks üòî. Also wish there were a""five minute break"" option that I could push so I could time a break and then get right back into it.",1
"Paid version is decent (app whitelist is amazing on saving progress due to system popups). I had a little bit of trouble actually activating it though (only used the app buttons the first time, and forgot the master enable). *Bring back the small cakes!* I thought their design was better than the anniversary one.",1
"I've only been using for a few hours but so far it has been easy to learn the basic features. The monetization is a bit annoying, but I'm planning to upgrade to remove those elements (unless this app has a subscription model, in which case I'll suffer through the ads etc.)",1
"it's a very useful app for anyone who has difficulty paying attention or those who are intimidated by a huge task (working on it for a small amount of time, for ex. 15mins, makes it seem less scary). this app, however, doesnt block msgs etc on my phone, so i have to set my phone to ""do not disturb"" mode manually.",1
This is a fantastic app to help you focus! The simple idea of not wanting your virtual tree to die is more effective than you would think. I'm a college student and I use this app to keep me from getting distracted while I'm working on assignments. I've recommended this app to many friends and even offer to pay the $2 charge the App Store has if they have an iPhone. The only think keeping me from giving this app 5 stars is that it has some (usually minor) bugs in it.,1
"i like this app, it has helped me ween away from picking up my phone mindlessly during work. one thing that bothers me is that it is default set to vibrate MADLY when the timer runs out, which defeats the purpose to me! also was very upset that when i answered the phone it killed my tree. i figured out how to turn off the phone setting, i thought i had got the vibrate to shut off but it went off again today. a user guide would be helpful because the interface is not user friendly.",1
"This is my favorite app. I use it for homework and practicing music. I own the paid version, and I think that it's worth it; I've added all of my favorite motivational quotes to it. All of the beautiful trees and flowers are lovely, and I find myself being proud of all my work. The only thing I would change is how gosh dang hard it is to get enough money to buy more trees or bushes. It takes a heck of a long time to do so.",1
"Great I've been using this app for more than a year now, and I love it. It allows me to focus more, since the distraction of you phone is now out the picture. How the app works; You choose the time period you want, then they plant a tree or shrub or etc. And if you get out of the app, you kill the plant. And each time you successfully don't get out of the app, your forest begins to grow. It helps to motivate you to start your work, and it helps you to concentrate on your work.",1
"I've been using Forest across multiple devices for a long time. My only gripe right now is that this app doesn't have a landscape mode. I use a tablet and keyboard in class and when I teach, but the Forest app doesn't rotate and becomes hard to use in those contexts.",1
"(Apr. 22, 2019 update) The essentials are all working fine, but my push notifications are buggy. The countdown freezes and I have to keep the app open to see the remaining time. I'm also not getting a sound notification when time is up. (I have a premium account.)",1
"I'll start out by saying I really like this app. It has really helped me stay focused on tasks like homework or reading. My only problem with this app is that most of the features you have to pay to use them. For example, making an account and being able to sync up you data with your computer. You have to pay for that. In my opinion, making an account should be free. Also, whitelisting apps is also a feature you need to pay for, which is a little upsetting. But still, it is a great app.",1
"Great focusing app, barely any ads, & the little trees & plants you can collect are adorable The only reason it isnt 5 stars is that those things werent what drew me to the app, the chance to plant real trees was. &while yes I did get to do that, they only allow you to plant 5 real trees. I wish I could plant more! At the end of the day, the cute digital trees arent going to impact my life & my planet as much as real ones. I would be more motivated to use it more if I could do more good with it.",1
Great app helps stay focused and makes it fun. Beautiful design! My pro version planted a few trees already. Development areas: if there would be a navigation guide to be easily accessed for 1st time users. To my mind quite a few auto-phrases sounded like dismissive orders vs. being inspirational. No ring or buzz once the timer is off. It would be helpful to have the auto suggestion for the quick break once the timer is off vs. trying to search for that within the menu. Low variety of plants.,1
"The app allow list and friends list need a search bar, and the plant a tree reminders need to be taken a step further: let your users set times for trees to auto-plant. That being said, forest is such a useful app that the premium version is well worth the money (and it's not even a subscription!) and I'm happy I bought it. My previous review mentioned bugs. Forest has a very active dev team; they have all been squashed. Great job!",1
"Great productivity app to make you feel proud of the time you spent working on a habit/skill. The trees are fairly pretty when you have the pro version. The only (nitpicky) complaint I have is the fact that the app does not double coins without having you watch ads, which in itself is very slow (slow load as well). I expected that paying money would remove such a need, but the developers thought otherwise.",1
"I've been using this for awhile and I like the simplicity of it. It has helped me focus more on my studies. I did pay for the upgrade. My only complaint is that when I switched to a new phone, then signed into the app, it did not have all my coins saved that I had. It had 295, and I had saved around 700 before switching. Not sure why, but it's annoying to pay for the upgrade but not have it work properly when I sign in on a new phone. It also looks like I'm not getting the upgraded features.",1
"Solid app. Would be better if you could add time once started and if there were chime options to ring when time was up. Also would be cool to have the option of notifications popping up with x amount of time left. If that already exists, pls lmk how to use. But I love growing the trees and that incentive to keep them healthy! I've had the app for a few years now.",1
"Very good at helping you focus and stay off social media while you're working. Wish there was a way to manage what apps it allows you to open while the tree is planted, as some of the academic apps I have (such as a textbook app and Canvas) cause the app to say to go back to the tree if I open them while a tree is planted. Still very motivating to have a small reward for staying focused!",1
"A great way to lock yourself out of your phone and be more present and mindful, though it does have ways to loophole that. Easy to use, though there can be some hiccups with room invites (but the room code handles that). I wish the forest display had more variety and that the bushes had different appearances for the different amount of time they were grown.",1
"Hi, I'm a forest pro member and I had started a tree and had to pause because I realized I needed to get a few things ready. I decided not to delete it and saw an option, I thought, was to show why that was in my forest. Instead it was ""Because you gave up"". Pretty rude and a little childish considering the lack of options to pause. Edit: I have since discovered how to edit the messages, so I'll add another star seeing as I really do enjoy this app. Still, pausing should be a thing",1
"Great concept, but I only gave 4 stars because I would have to buy the premium version to be able to use other apps along with the Forest app. There are many different scenarios I would need to use another app. For example, I may need to use my calculator for my math homework or I will oftentimes use my phone for references while I draw. It's much harder to focus when I can't use the resources on my phone while I use this app. I love the idea of the app, but I really need that one feature.",1
"This showed up as a Pomodoro app in the Play Store. I'm all for gamifying tasks, so I liked the idea of growing a virtual forest by staying focused on work. It's simple. Plant a seed. Work for 25 minutes. You have a cute tree. Satisfying. Con: there's no alert telling you your 25 minutes are up. And when you use the stopwatch function, for some reason it takes 60 minutes to grow a tree instead of 50. So it's not really aligned with the Pomodoro technique. But it's cool for what it is.",1
"I love the app! It's a great way to stay focused, especially with all the quarantining going on. However, I have one issue with this app: the ambient noises you can play don't loop properly, and become glitchy if you let them play for too long.",1
"absolutely love this app, everything about it is good. my one problem is that the option to plant trees in reality, shouldn't be just for pro version but for everyone - at least limit the number of trees we can plant in reality, to user like myself that prefer the free version. Our environment isn't for people that can use the pro version but for everyone, pro and free. everyone should be given the opportunity to help our environment,even of its limited.",1
"I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è! I would, however, like if you could add something more to make the app feel even more polished and more peaceful. For instance: animals that wonder around your forest and the healthier the forest the more animals come or you could move your trees and add rivers. Worth the $2.00 for premium. Very good for big groups to focus. I love the store and the fact that you can buy different trees to grow, get different sounds, and music.",1
"The app is awesome. Really wish you could tag and name trees before you plant them. That would be a nice quality-of-life change. Also, if you could make the app more compatible for chromebooks, that would be nice too. Chromebooks are excellent work computers and I need a good working app on it. I really hope forest can work in the future.",1
"I really like this ap, but I was disappointed when I finally switched to the paid version and found there was no option to double coins after studying was completed. If it is available with ads, I feel like it should automatically come with the paid version. Other than that, a really helpful and pretty app.",1
The app is quite helpful! I definitely leave my phone alone when I'm growing a tree. Only reason it's not a 5 star is because the pro version of the app is a little buggy. Sometimes it gets stuck on an error message saying that you need to try again later. You're stuck with that unless you restart the app. Otherwise though the app is great!,1
Good üòäüëç,1
Cool and calm pleasant forest rain makes us to focus more for the reason why we have started it and avoiding distractions to reach out next minute away goal that's by practice possible even more with better environment by this app ..... More of a game thing which hits ur dopamine while studying too...,1
Good,1
I really struggle with putting my phone down and not habitually picking it up minutes later. This app is the only thing that has really helped me. Whenever I see my phone usage becoming problematic I start using it for a few days and it really seems to help. I have been using this app for multiple years. Also love that I can help the world in some small way.,1
"Very helpful when studying or when you just want time off your phone! im horrible when it comes to doing homework or dedicating time to read, but with this app (and the sounds you can unlock so it isnt super quiet and awkward) ive managed to be more involved with my school work and im halfway through a book! you can customize what trees show up in your forest the more you focus, and can help the process of planting more trees. i really love this app :^)",1
"Forest is incredible! If you're like me and feel motivated by both the concreteness of a timer and cozy woodland art, you might love this app as well. It's part of my daily work routine and helps me avoid getting sucked into my phone. You can earn coins for focus time and save them up to buy new tree/flower types, so there's a little sense of progress there as well. It's beautifully simple and effective.",1
"I came across Forest while looking through simulation games, and like the 'leave your phone alone' angle. Motivational messages display as the timer runs, and if you're doing something where you're going to be away from your phone anyway, why not set the timer and plant a tree? You can double your earned coins by watching an ad. Other than that, as are very minimal. It's a focus game, after all.",1
"This is one of the best apps I've ever downloaded and purchased. Great idea, with an adorable presentation. They lock custom labels for your growing sessions behind a pay-wall, but so many other great things are unlocked that it's well-worth the $2. Their other app, ""Sleep Town,"" is also adorable and the same price for great features. I use both apps on a regular basis and highly recommend them.",1
"This is my favorite way of keeping track of time and motivating myself to do things I don't feel like doing. My only suggestions would be to add even more trees, add automatic timers/ a scheduler if I want to enforce a schedule, and make the alarms louder or more than just one chime. Alternatively, more customizing options for alarms would be nice. I've missed Forest alarms before, so being able to make the alarms more noticeable would be appreciated.",1
"Over the years, I've experimented with a lot of different productivity apps, but Forest:Stay Focused is the only one that I've continued using. The incentive to grow beautiful and creative trees really does encourage me to focus on my work. I love that new tree and plant species are added all of the time. I do wish that there were more ambient noises to unlock and more badges to earn. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with this app and think that it is worth the money.",1
"It's an amazing app. I've been using it for years and it has helped me a lot. I upgraded to premium just recently. I think an option should be available for people to search study rooms and be able to join them. It's extremely difficult to find a friend that studies with forest, premium version, and would want to study at the same time I would. Being able to study with another, even a random person I might not even know, can immensely improve my outcome.",1
I paid for the pro version and it was definitely worth it. Growing cute little plants for some reason is enough to keep me off my phone when I need to study or when I'm just tired of my phone addiction. I do have one small suggestion. Maybe have advanced app allowed settings so I can set which apps to allow depending on which category I chose. Ex. Journaling category I could allow pinterest but study category wouldn't allow it. (Hope that makes sense).,1
"Forest is great! I had the Apple version originally then switched to Android and was happy to pay $2 twice. I'm very motivated by cute aesthetics and gamification, and I mainly use the app to track the time I spend on my dissertation. I don't always use it when I work, but I often do, and it's nice that it can be as intense or as chill as you like. The stats are fun and useful. I recommend it!",1
"Update: Thank you Forest for the quick reply. I deleted the app cache and restarted my phone. Somehow that did it. No issues anymore. Keep up the good work! Old: I would give this app 5 stars because it's simply amazing for making me focus both at work and during study sessions. Seriously, life changing. However, it crashes every single time I try to purchase a new sound with my coins or try to add a friend. I upgraded to the paid version and have a Samsung S9+, if that helps.",1
"It's not very different from a timer but it does let you keep track of progress in different areas if you use all the features like tags or different trees. Side note the alarm only works if you are not in ""deep focus"". I do think it helps me focus when I pick my phone up and those reminders pop up, like a good accountability-buddy.",1
"The genius of this app is it's simplicity. The apps works by encouraging not using your phone versus locking you out of your phone or apps. The incentive is little trees you grow by twenty-five minutes of no phone use at a time. If you give up during that, you get a withered tree instead on your plot of forest. It's making staying off your phone a game. I've just been using the free version. The paid version is very cheap and a one time purchase. I'm considering that as well.",1
"UPDATE: changed to 5 stars due to the price changes in the store. The pop up ads are still a little annoying but it's still not too much of q problem. I love the variety in plants you can buy! It's a really cute app. Occasionally an ad would pop up outta nowhere but it's not too much of a problem. I think it'd be nice for the bushes to cost lower than the trees, due to them not needing as much time off to grow, but that's just my opinion. üòä",1
"I really like this all. It let's you quantify your focused time, and theres something so rewarding about it. Not only that, but the aesthetic of having a ""digital"" forest is simply beautiful. I may even consider getting the premium version. At least for me, a timer is not enough when I do homework; I need to see something that tracks my progress in a more creative way, and this is exactly it.",1
"Forest is the perfect app for anyone who struggles with self control with their phone. It helps you keep focus while providing fun and cute rewards, which allows you to feel a sense of accomplishment when you look at your grown trees. It's free, but I recommend supporting this app and getting the premium, which allows you to whitelist certain apps, receive statistics about your usage, and no ads. One of my favorite apps on my phone.",1
"I am incredibly easily distractible, and would rather do anything but focus. Forest blocks me from my most common distraction by threatening me with the horrifying fear of murdering my precious baby tree. The app is cute and easy to use, and I love all the little tree designs, plus the fact that you can customize the background noise. It's great!",1
"I really like Forest, and I'm glad it's free on android. I am weirdly sympathetic to digital plants and animals, so the motivation to stay away from my phone and not kill the plants by exiting the app is strong. I would feel really bad if one died!! Great app interface. Simple and cute, and pleasing for someone like me with aspegers. Edit: oh, please bring back the extended timer feature! I miss being able to set it to 8 hours to keep me from using my phone during the night.",1
"A really cute little app that really helps keep me off of the stuff that distracts me the most. I'm not sure if it's accessible in the standard version, but I love being able to choose which apps are still okay for me to navigate to, like texting apps. And I like being able to change that when I need to (in between times of planting trees, not during the planting). Highly recommend if you're like me and tend to dissociate into your phone for hours when you have stuff to do.",1
"A game-changer in productivity. Having a real motivator for focusing is an incredibly aspect of this app. The in-app experience is clean and appealing. A must-have for people who want to get busy. Suggestion: Planting messages are great, and being able to customize them is a splendid option. However, what if we had to option to customize it while planting? That way, we can put up a to-do list or a reminder!",1
"Love this app! Not overwhelming like some apps, and perfect amount of customization. I just have a couple ideas/suggestions: First, it would be nice to have more achievements to unlock in the future! Also, I think it would be really cool if there was some sort of ""real tree icon"" that would show up in the virtual forest next to the other trees?? It's really nice having the virtual trees to look at and see how much time I've spent studying, but I also want to help out! Keep up the great work!",1
"I'm a senior in college and I've been using the app for 3 semesters now and I'm OBSESSED. I love how you can actually see a physical representation of your hard work, and the plants are adorable! It really helps me avoid getting distracted by my phone both while studying and doing tasks like cleaning. It doesn't completely drown you with ads either, and the few automatic ones are very short. Overall great user experience, the devs did a fantastic job!",1
"Love this app! I use it in conjunction with a physical timer, that one is more for the alarm aspect, this one really helps me not get distracted by social media. It's easy to select which apps you want to allow use, though selecting the system ones can be really tedious because of all the different system functions for one action. But, it's not a deal breaker. Would recommend to anyone looking for a satisfying reward to not letting your phone distract you while you're trying to focus.",1
"Great way to focus! I love that you can set allow lists for certain apps! Edit: I reached the five tree limit, and although I understand why it exists, I do wish you could plant more the longer you have had the app installed, or could buy more at a higher price. I don't know if that would be possible, but I wanted to put the suggestion out there. Still an excellent app!",1
"amazing app. very simple, easy to use interface. extremely helpful when you need to focus. the only thing that would be great is if tree type that you purchase had separate stats or features. for example, if tree 1 provides a better coin amount or a compound effect, plant X amount of same trees and it gets stronger and gives you more coins.",1
"Am I so base that simple gamification of my time helps me stay focused? Yes, and this is the perfect tool. I've had this installed on my phone for a while now, but this week I actually used it regularly and I feel like successful and accomplished. It's pretty amazing how much real work gets done in 25 minutes when I'm not trying to do everything and checking all my other apps. definitely switching to premium too.",1
I don't ever rate apps but I really like this one. I have pretty bad ADHD and it makes it hard for me to sit down and study or do homework. I get distracted easily and don't feel like I really accomplish anything. But Forest really helps me stay on track by locking me out of apps and I get to actually see my hard work through my cute little forest. The pro version is definitely worth it (its only like $3) and I love all of the cute trees and flowers. :),1
"I used to be a study skills tutor, and I commonly recommended this to students who struggled to stay off their phones or needed a focus timer. Forest is visually appealing, motivating, and user friendly. Unlike many other apps of its type, it doesn't induce shame; someone can go back to their phone in an emergency, they just lose the tree. It also allows for easy time tracking, amd for students to play music/spotify throughout the period (so long as they don't adjust). Love this app!",1
"I love this, it has legitimately helped my focus and productivity a ton during this pandemic. I had a lot of trouble focusing at home when my college went online, but this is simple, clear, pretty, and very satisfying. The free version has all I needed but I upgraded just to support the people who made this. I use this daily, even months later. I've recommended it to family, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs some help staying motivated and focused during all this!",1
"I've used this app off and on for many years. It brings me so much joy when I use it, and I always feel more productive and motivated. I love seeing my forest grow and I love that I can keep track of custom subjects/tasks and the time spent with each. I bought premium awhile ago. I didn't care about the benefits. I just wanted to support an incredible app.",1
This app is amazing it offers relaxing sounds to play while you work and flashes motivating messages at the top of the screen. It has a give up button but those motivating messages help me keep focused. The type of tree you get depends on how long you work when you're finished you gave the option to take a break. I really do recommend this app especially if you are a student.,1
"Update: excellent FAQ & support components for the app! Both issues resolved, and support team member was helpful and easily contacted. 5 stars. Effective & well-designed app! I've enjoyed using it enough that I bought the upgrade. However, when I did so, I lost my previous purchase (Octopus Tree)- it seems like purchases made with coins should carry over into the paid version. Please let me know how to resolve this. Also, the app is often slow to load when switching pages within the app.",1
"This app has been an absolute lifesaver since having to work at home. I dont use it every day but there are some days where it's been too easy to get sucked in to my phone and starting this is usually enough to get me focused back on work so I only have to use it once or twice. The ""stopwatch"" feature is absolutely perfect for me. I work better with a timer counting up instead of down and this let's me get trees for however long I can focus instead of having to guess how long that will be.",1
"Thus far, I'm enjoying this app. I feel absolutely motivated in completing a task; and, staying on track. Even, when I feel like getting off track, I'm reminded of the growth that's manifesting between my tree and myself. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the best app ever. Looking forward to additional features!",1
"Amazing app!! Helped me alot with medical school. **Just a suggestion, it'd be really helpful if we can have the option to start a new clear forest (just like the ones we have at each new year) so that we can start a new forest at the beginning of each new college semesters in September/October instead of 1st January, it'd be really amazing to compare the focused time between 2 semesters instead of 2 years",1
"Super effective, I've tried lots of other apps to focus and the way this one forces you back to focusing is so nice. Also, the premium is totally worth it for the price with being able to have an allow list and more customizable options. I'd recommend it to any chronic phone addict or extremely busy person who needs every minute of their day to count.",1
"As someone who really struggles with staying on task, staying focused and getting things started, this app has helped me tremendously. I highly HIGHLY recommend getting the full version bc It is only $2 and SO worth it, but even if you don't get it, it is still a wonderful app. There are so many useful features and encouraging messages. This app has honeslty changed my life and I am so so happy it exists. Thank you for making this!!!",1
"Love this app! I sprang for the premium version, which is something I honestly never do. In truth though, you don't need the premium version. The free version is light on the ads and ultimately has the same functionality. It really helps me to concentrate on whatever I'm doing and be proud of myself when I see my whole garden of bushes and trees!",1
"So many great updates! I love all the statistics this app provides. I look forward to completing my task and remain focused when I use this app. Couple this with their Water-Do app is a must! I look forward to getting things done. I'm all about the stats, so being able to visually see how much I get done so beautifully is motivating for me. I'd love more audio/sound options added, please.",1
"Got this when I realized I got most distracted from my work by looking at my phone. Really helps me focus when I need to. I didn't want one of those apps that completely locks down your phone in case I actually needed to use it for something important, but I don't want to kill my trees for unimportant stuff. Also I like that they have a variety of trees that you have to work to get. It makes me more motivated to use the app. I hope they add more season-themed trees (snow covered would be cool!)",1
"Bought the full version of the app and love it. Definitely helps with motivation during the day. My only wish is that you could combine trees of the same type at the end of the day or something, to get the more complex trees (since I have ADD, and focusing for 120 min at a time is monumental). One small bug is that when you plant a tree by yourself, it shows a friend's icon instead of your own. Such a small complaint! xD I'll be using this app for ages, I reckon.",1
"I don't usually leave reviews for any apps I use but for this one I'll definitely make an exception. Awesome app for sure! Forest really helps keep me focused and on task and seeing the visual representation of my hard work (the forest of trees planted while studying) really drives me to continue working. Also, love the ability to make real change by planting trees irl just by studying and using the app. All around really awesome idea, definitely worth the download and the dollar upgrade.",1
"This has to be one of the best focus apps there is! The gamification of getting you to focus does a great job in getting you to do so by blocking other apps and allowing you to grow some cool trees and what not. I've definitely seen an improvement in my ability to focus, which at time where seemingly everything is fighting for your attention, it's helps alot! Great job and glad I got the premium version which has allowed me to carry my progress across my different devices!",1
"Ive been using Forest for several years now. As an adult with ADHD, I often have trouble focusing on the task at hand. I use Forest to tell my distractible brain when it's time to concentrate, and the charming trees and shrubs give me a little reward when I succeed. It's a brilliant tool for anyone who needs a little extra incentive to get the job done.",1
"I'm now editing my review and giving this app 5 stars. I've realized that although getting more plants to use is a slow process, it's supposed to be that way. If you were able to get more plants quickly and easily you'd have less incentive for using the app as much. I really enjoy slowly racking up coins and buying new plants for me to plant in my Forest. Phenomenal app that has helped me with digital minimalism and enjoying the present moment more. üòÑüåπ",1
"I have used many focus apps throughout college and none of them worked. I was skeptical going into this app thinking ""this is just another focus app, it's not going to work"". Oh boy was I wrong. This app really helps me sit down and focus without any distractions. I HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who has problems focusing on something for more than 10 mins. If you're still skeptical like I was try downloading it and plant your first tree.",1
"I love it I've only had it for 2 days and I already upgraded to the pro version. I think it's great for people like me who get distracted easily. I love the creativity of the app and the forest feature. I think the pro version is worth every penny. one thing I would change about it would be the growing process, it would be cool if the plant would have more phases of growing. For example, the pine tree goes from a small sprout to the tree from one second to the next. But besides that, perfect!!",1
"This app has helped decreased my screen time so much and improved the quality of my studying. I use the allow list + deep focus mode to ensure I'm only accessing things that will make me successful while in school mode! You can even plant with friends, which is fun an acts as another avenue of accountability. If one person kills the tree, it kills the tree for everyone. The trees are super cute and it's fun to make patterns if you're feeling ambitious! I love using the Chrome extension as well. I can make sure all websites except my school stuff is off limits. That way, I literally am unable to goof off on my computer if I'm planting on my phone. I definitely need the double accountability. Awesome!",1
"Literally the only app I've ever used where gameification was actually effective and not annoying! Actually, it *is* annoying--why can't I just choose the tree and background sound that I want? But the fact that I actually *want* those sounds that help me focus and those different trees that visually differentiate my tasks entices me to log my hours and get those coins! Which means I'm actually being more productive! 1 note: make the alarm when you complete a session louder so I don't miss it!",1
"I've never been able to study or do my homework because of my adhd, which I get easily distracted with, but with this I'm able to focus and occasionally look at the screen to see my tree has grown, its amazing and really rewarding. If you leave the app and give up your trees wither but if it gives you a warning and you go back then they keep growing which is pretty cool. Its an amazing app to use, I highly recommend it, and no, this isn't a fake review :) love this app <3",1
"My favorite study tool! It's really helpful to set the timer and just focus on my work until I get the notification that my tree finished growing. That way, I make sure to include breaks while still keeping on task when I'm working. Plus, it's motivating to visually see my forest grow after having worked a lot. The trees and plants you can get are so cute too!",1
"This app has really helped to improve my focus while working, bc it's encouraging to know that I'm growing a forest, while using my time intentionally! The rain ambiance is very nice as well, and overall I celebrate small wins when I see how much time I've focused on my tasks. There are some parts of the app that are a bit confusing for me and I wish it were a bit more detailed in usage. Overall the app is useful and the Tiny Tan ver. is so cute! üíúüíúüíú",1
"This app is amazing and legitimately saved my thesis. I am so distracted by my phone, but the idea of me ""killing a tree"" because I checked Facebook made me think twice. It is worth the purchase in my book. Essentially, it's a glorified, ""be productive for however long you need,"" Pomodoro timer. Will recommend to anyone looking for an extra motivation boost!",1
"I appreciate all the great features to provide a unique focusing experience. I like being able to add certain apps to the white list so that I can still use them while the forest app is running. I love listening to podcasts and music on YouTube while cleaning, so I liked being able to add it to my whitelist. I also love the great selection of beautiful plants, and how they keep releasing new trees!",1
"I absolutely love the cute theme! The app is really good for focus, and my little siblings love reading the quotations you put on there! Its quite addicting in my opinion. Growing a litttle forest with this app by putting your phone down is awesome! I think something that might be good/cool is something for overnight. You could grow multiple trees/bushes/etc. Or 1 big tree/bush/etc. It would help for if you woke up in the middle of the night, and figured you might want to use your phone.",1
"This app is great for focusing! It gives you a cute incentive to keep going, and the pro version is definitely worth it. Being able to write my own messages for myself and get achievements makes this app all the more helpful. But even the free version is great. Anyone who has trouble getting off their phone will find a great learning tool in this app.",1
"This app is an absolute lifesaver, and with the browser extension it's even more helpful. As someone with ADHD, I often struggle to stay focused on things that need to be done. This app helps keep me from getting distracted, and when it seems like the work is taking forever, it doubles as a timer that I don't want to cancel. I can look at how long I have left and tell myself that I can't take a break until my tree is grown. Trying to collect all the different trees gives me added incentive to use it as well. One of the only apps I've ever paid for, and I don't regret it one bit. (It functions perfectly well without paying; I just wanted to support the app.) Thank you so much for this wonderful app. A+++.",1
"I recommend this app to all of my friends for studying! In addition to the focus help, it motivates me to get more done and to challenge myself in new ways! I especially like seeing a whole forest for a day, month, etc. Sadly, there was no way to transfer my plants when I got a new phone, so I am having to unlock plants again.",1
"Great app! Works as intended and super cute and motivating, I love their backround sounds. I do wish there was a bit more personalization within the app however, like being able to name our planting reminders and being able to change the notification sound for forest. Aswell as more trees/coins for more time. If I focused for two hours on timer mode, I would get 5 trees instead of 4. Where if I focused for 30 minute blocks for a total of 2 hours I would only receive 4 trees.",1
"It feels really good knowing I'm breaking my phone habit while also contributing to reforestation. I think I need to see the physical progress of how much I get done in a day. Plus the rainforest sounds block out background noise which helps me concentrate. They have other sounds too. It's really nice, try it if you can. You don't need to buy anything either unless you want to",1
"Forest is brilliant. if you want to focus, it's the way to go. the Premium features (which really dont cost much, so cheap!) let you plant together with friends and participate in the leaderboard. I've been using Forest for a long time, and I definitely love it. I figured it's time to give them a review, since I use it practically everyday!",1
"I love this app! I used it when I was back in school and it was very helpful for keeping me focused on studying. I find myself too distracted while working from home, so I decided to redownload Forest. The app is still easy to navigate and use :) I would definitely recommend this to anyone who catches themselves on their phone for long periods of time while teleworking.",1
"Cute app that helps me stay focused. It's customizability makes it really great, so I can tell it what apps are and aren't okay for me to use. Like if I'm doing work and I NEED to check my email for something related to what I'm doing, I can take my email app off of the black list Also it's kinda nice to plant a real tree every once and a while the focus rewards. If you're struggling to tame your time on your phone during times you should be focusing, the free version is worth a try.",1
"Rewarding and Beneficial! üåø Recently I've been having a hard time locking down to do my homework or studying since I've been adjusting to a new environment (aka College). This app helped me take my very first step into a productive grind by allowing me to reward myself everytime I finish a study session. Fair warning: You shouldn't cheat yourself. With this app comes growth and a great observation of who you really are when you're in the ""zone"".",1
"I really like this app. It helps me stay away from my phone while I study. It lets me grow cute trees üòç I got the Pro version to let me create/join groups and it definitely helps me to be more accountable because if I leave, everyone else's tree dies too. There's also a whitelist feature that allows me to choose certain apps that i=I can use while on in a group. initially, I thought that the 'multiplier' function was gone when I got the Pro version, but I found that I could turn it on in the settings. And I think the best feature is that I get to grow real trees too! Super recommend the app!",1
"Great app to help stay focused. Some things can be improved though: 1. Sync frequency: Can users set the sync frequency by themselves, or at least make it sync automatically every day/ every time using it? I uninstall it by mistake and lose a whole week record. I feel really sad about it:( 2. Sync the app whitelist. Not sure if the button at the upper right corner on the app whitelist page is for sync, but it does not work very well. I need to set up the whitelist manually after reinstall it.",1
"Really helpful in getting me to focus on my schoolwork without worrying about getting distracted on my phone. The concept is cute, and I often look forward to getting enough coins to unlock new trees and plants. I like the different tree design options too - there are some cool and unique designs for a customizable Forest experience. Overall a good and effective app (at least for me)",1
Really impressed with interface and its theme üëå üëè,1
It keeps me focused and helps me study more efficiently. My only issue is that you have to pay to study with friends.,1
Easy and simple to use,1
best app for keeping consistency,1

it is amazing app it helps me stay focused the songs of the water really help me focus more. This app is a very very good app I really appreciate it. I hope you install this app and I hope you install this app.,1
"this app helps me to keep track of the hours have spent studying ‚ù§Ô∏è , I love it .",1
Nice apps,1
So far so good .. but i prefer more beautiful plants on it .,1
Very nice,1
The app has allowed me to become more focused in my study sessions and it helps keeping me away from distractions. But I hope the developers could add more features to add excitement to the users and be more engaged with app.,1

Very well app for student,1
Nice app,1
Great app. Really brings about productivity and motivates you to do more cause you'll just wanna come right back and plant more trees,1
#NAME?,1
Nice app,1
Great app...,1
"I'm really enjoying watching my forest grow so things I used to struggle to accomplish each day are going far more smoothly for me thus completing my task list is becoming a source of joy and strength rather than the stressful, confusing thing it was merely a week ago. I'm using the free version but plan to spend the $3.49 for the full version very soon.",1
It is very good app for focus but alarm iss very week can you make the alarm stronger üí™ it will makes decipline,1
It is a good app you should definitely try it,1
"Staying focus is a decision. I work hard and want to be 100% productive. But, when things are extra hard, it's easier to get busy. I found this app in the book Indistractable by Nir Eyal. I was skeptical but the more I use it, the more I find it useful. The hidden idea that I'm planting trees while doing the hardest work, its becoming unexpectedly motivating. The app is always giving you nuggets of encouragement to stay on task. I would add some motivational quotes.",1
"I like this app for holding me accountable when I'm trying to unplug and focus. It can even guide you back to the app when you try and wander to a distracting app. I really don't buy Pro versions of things, but honestly I think it's worth it. It's such a handy tool, and there are options to grow real trees just by focusing with the pro version, as well as more trees to plant! Very cute. I'm also trying out their ""WaterDo"" To-Do App, which is also handy and cute. 10/10 useful and fun challenge!",1
"Relaxing and useful for many purposes! I love the options for customization related to app use, timing, white noise soundtracks and the ability to design my own garden as the reward feature. More than any other aspect, I appreciate that the app is meant to increase productivity through positive reinforcement (reward) and that it's a tool meant to help the user throughout the process. Thanks, Forest creators!",1
"This app has greatly helped me in creating better study habits and eliminating procrastination (I'm a high school senior for reference). Part of the reason is because, rather than simply completely blocking usage of apps, it allows you to choose to break your streak, forcing you to actually consider the consequences of procrastinating. My only gripe is that I feel like the ability to whitelist apps should be free (although it is only around $3, which isn't bad). I'd recommend it to anyone.",1
"best app for staying focused and locking your phone while you work. there are other knockoff ""free"" apps that are similar but they all have micropayments for what this app comes with, and add up to be more expensive, or they use a system of using money as a deterrent to looking at your phone- which doesnt really work since mistakes do happen (go to check the timer and accidentally exit the app for instance), or don't really allow for smaller time settings, but those 15-20min trees add up!",1
"I downloaded this app back in 2016, and I still use it consistently so I thought it finally deserved a review :) I love the Deep Focus feature - allowing me to whitelist apps means I can keep my music on and text my husband back without losing my tree or getting distracted by Instagram. While there are a lot of features you have to pay for, it's literally never bothered me - I just want to plant my little trees and focus. I get so invested in them - I think I've killed <5 in 8 years! Thank you!",1
"I love this app! unlike other focusing apps that just yell at you and block you from websites, this app actually puts something at stake. if you stop focusing, your tree dies. if you successfully focus, you're rewarded with a new addition to your forest! this risk and reward system has been really effective for me. plus, once I get enough coins I can use them to plant a real tree and add some good to the world! üå≤üíö",1
"I have used this app for a few years, and I just enjoy it so much. It really helps during crunches like finals. I also just love all the different trees and seeing them at the end of the day. If you like the idea of the Pomodoro method but struggle with it like me, something about promising a virtual tree I'll study for them helps. Don't ask me how, it just does for some reason üòÇ",1
"I highly recommend the forest app of you're struggling to stay committed to tasks such as writing, exercise, work from home. The experience with the app is so pleasant it makes you want to log to and do your tasks. It has helped me with daily progress and even pushing past my original goals! The only this I wish was different was that you don't get an alarm or sound when the timer is finished. I understand why you can't pause it, because taking a break interfers with productivity.",1
"I've been using Forest on and off for years and it's wonderful at its job. I often struggle with focusing on tasks and it's helped immensely with discipline. Something I wish was a feature is combining the allow list with the tags, or having an option to pick the allow list when starting a session. I have different allow lists for different tasks and often forget to switch and need to cancel my timer midway through. I do love this app and will continue using for years :)",1
"Great app! Motivational and helps you to get your things done. One thing is that the price of the plants are too high. I don't know, it may vary person to person, but I am a lazy person, so maybe I'm getting fewer coins every time I complete a goal. In all, very good app. I'm using it before my exams and it helps very much. Also, too many features are in premium. Leave a little for us too!",1
It would be nice if there were more opportunities for free trees. I'm low income and can't afford the paid version. But it's a nice simple easy-to-use app.,1
Still no Android widget.,1
This is a great app for students. I love it ‚ô•,1
ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ ÿ¨ÿØÿß,1
I really found this app very effective coz I am able concentrate on my studies better than before. The growth of the plant acts like an incentive and gives me the urge to push hard and study futher hrs.. the quotes which keep on poping also helps a lot but I would love to see other categories too other than just a plant!!,1
"The app works just great . I just have one problem. I downloaded forest on another device however I have lost all the coins, plants and sounds that I previously purchased. Isn't there a way to get them back?",1
"The app is overall great and for me personally motivating :)! But double coins by watching adds stopped working for me at some point and nothing helps :(. Reinstalling the app as well, same with updating, switching my vpn on/off... Nothing :(...",1
Ok ok,1
We need more plants for free users as wellüò≠and also pls like make the trees like watch ads and use them once.,1
The best for concentration... I use it frequently and plus point is that it makes me feel realise that im being not so productive and accumulating my time.. It is so interesting because u actually feel like you're planting treesüíå,1
Takes too much storage and the main reason why I installed is because of the trees and the animation was good but to plant trees you need to pay .this app requires payment for each and every thing,1
Great and I'm doing this for theplanthehe,1
"So cuteeee, I love‚ô°",1
"I feel very confident to tell u guys that u should at least try it for sometime ,the result u will see make u amaze .",1
plant tree did a thing,1
I would like to see more trees without the pro version,1
It's really fun and helpful to do with my friends!,1
This is a great study progress tracker and study timer app. With this app I guarantee you that you will be more productive.,1
Pls provide more stuff to spend our coins on..,1
"I honestly don't review apps on Google but this made me say, if you are someone trying to maintain a study schedule and not procrastinate, this is it.. I myself am a high school student, and this is very effective if you have deadline over your head for completion of syllabus/homework.. Even tho the membership is reasonable, it wouldn't have hurt if the planting real trees was free of cost but I believe it is pretty understandable why they didn't give it for free, other than that, it's perfect!!",1
Best for building habit,1
Actually... It's pretty darn good. Yes you pay a subscription for full functionality but if you have a lot of projects and other stuff to track it's worth it. I also have to say that I love that there is a nice Chrome extension/widget (whatever)... so nice to be able to work on the desktop as well. Yes OneNote is good but honestly TickTick is much much better for tracking tasks with due dates IMO. Cheers!,1
"So far so good! I've been using the free version for a week now, and I'm loving it! I'm still learning to get the full potential for my needs, but it handles list and recurring events, with ending dates and times (detailed and Personalized), the way I was looking for. I love the Eisenhower Matrix, probably the payed version customizes better than the free one, but I love it, as that's something I learned in the book, and keep in mind through the day. I will switch to the payed full version soon.",1
I recommend this app if you want to save your time.,1
one of the task organizers I like it and use it to make my day more efficient,1
tbis is very good.,1
tasted and trusted,1
I'm good man I hope your having good ones,1
Great app,1

I have actually been using this app for what feels like years now. Through different iterations of their app and different iterations of my work flow. Idk why I like it so much and I'm probably not using it at 100% percent of the total application but I really appreciate it. Genuinely this app has been a powertool in my personal small business. I would love the premium version thank you!,1
great assistant,1
"O app √© muito bom para planejar e organizar as tarefas do dia, cumpre exatamente oque promete, por√©m nessa √∫ltima atualiza√ß√£o a praticidade no uso do aplicativo ficou comprometida devido aos an√∫ncios q colocaram, o que quebra a produtividade do usu√°rio.",1

"Love the app, one of the most useful apps I have. Had an issue with moments before but it is intuitive and still has the same functionality. Looking forward to testing out the family features as I feel that's the only thing that was missing.",1
"After last update, there is a glitch. If there are multiple reminders open, above other app or on home screen, snoozing one will close all of them. And then you have manually trace all others which closed without snoozing or any other action. Before update, it was working fine.",1

"Had it for a few years now and it's great! I love how you can create lists for different things, cross items off but they don't completely go away just incase you get ahead of yourself and wish to bring that crossed off item back you can and so much more. ADHD friendly. Plain and simple look for those wanting something not so colorful Too much colors can be a distraction for some ADHD folk like me so this helps a bunch! Thank you!",1

nice app,1
Love the app for everyday and repeating reminders. Couldn't live without it now after 2 years. Nothing gets forgotten anymore.,1
"Hi! I love the app! Hovewer I miss the possibility to click on a task and mark it as in progress: I schedule the task ""Write one page"" for Monday at 9:00. At 9:00 I will get the reminder, and this is where I would like to click on ""In progress"" because else I have to postpone it, and it's kind of demotivating. Putting it in progress and seeing in the notificationbar that it is ungoing would make me continue writing. It would be so cool of you could add that to the app üòÄ",1
I usually don't use planner apps as they can be quite confusing and fill my phone up with notifications. But this app has actually helped me be more productive. I can plan what I need doing and when I want it done by along with a really helpful pop up to remind me at the time. If I can't do it at that time it gives me the option to snooze the pop up for anytime. I would 100% recommend this app if you want to be more organised and productive.,1
"Keeps getting better and better with the updates and new features. I only use the free version but it gives me all the tools I need to manage tasks and todo lists. Love that it's cross platform so I can get access on any of my devices. Clean, easy interface means I enjoy using it and it keeps me engaged on a daily basis. Great app, love it...",1
"I love this app, you can create as many categories for your lists as you like, it's easy to use, you can collaborate with family and friends. Would highly reccomend.",1
"I didn't like getting notifications like ""What are you going to work on today?"" Thanks to the response from the developer on how to turn off that daily push notification.",1
I love this app. I made a grocery list. share it with my husband. if either one of us goes we have a current up to date list at all times and can mark it off as we go. it's great.,1
Just like having a personal assistant in your pocket simple to use works great! ü§∏üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1
"The best To-do app out there. Good layout, organization system, reminders, intuitive, simple, customizable. Syncs between devices and with Google calendar smoothly. The daily planner and widgets are useful. The free version is more than enough to get going, and the premium features are definitely worth it. Recommended! Any.do has anthing you need in a To-do app, no need to try any other apps. The only thing I would add is a Pomodoro timer or similar time management tool.",1
"I find the Any.do app to be a great way to capture any to do lists. I love that I xan run multiple lists, share them, and check them off as I get things done. Gone are the frustrations if lising my list, or my oen while grocery shopping or running errands. It's all conveniently on my phone. I add irems as I think about them. It's easy to repopulate the grocery list which saves typing. This app helps me stay organized and streamlines daily errands and tasks. Thank you for the excellent app.",1
"I love this app and I cannot think of any flaws it has. I particularly appreciate that I am able to create subtasks and to connect it to Google calendar, and that it is accessible on both my phone and my laptop. Regarding this, the synchronisation between my devices has also worked well until now. I don't use the premium version, but I think the price is quite acceptable.",1
"Really great ""to do"" app. Allows for adding subtasks, notes and files + tags to distinguish among projects / lists. Very easy. Excellent reminders with ""one touch"" snooze possibilities. Prompts to plan ahead your day a pleasant surprise feature. ""Focus on an activity"" in order to eliminate distractions, another great surprise feature. Excellent service response. Only annoying, you have to first save task & date and then go back to it to add tags, notes etc. But overall, superb.",1
"I have been using this app for 2 years, still my favorite to-do list app from other apps. It has a clean widget I can see on my home screen, also allow me to add a new to-do item straight from the widget without going into the app. I also love that it sync up with my Google Calendar. Moreover, all of these features given are totally FREE! Thank you!",1
"I've been on Premium plan since '14, have tried other apps for comparison along the way, and I still haven't found any reason to give up my current plan. Any.do provides a lot of useful features w/o overwhelming users. Other apps may have a lot more features, but they're designed in a way that overwhelms new users (making them unusable). Customer support is TOP NOTCH too! I had an accidental billing issue (that was mostly my fault) w/c they immediately reversed upon request... over the holidays!",1
"A great little basic organiser app, nice and simple to use, clear, user friendly and not over complicated, grabs calendar entries from pre-installed phone calendar, doesn't bombard you with notifications, well worth the money. I have just started using some of the more detailed features and am enjoying the simplicity. I've tried other organiser apps that are way too sophisticated for my needs, this app motivates me and I can use it even when I'm in a hurry or half asleep.",1
"This app is my spare memory and I love it! It takes so much of my stress by reminding me, keeping track of my tasks...just perfect, easy and quick to use and setup all the things I need To Do. I use this app for her long time, tried few other, in the meantime but back to this one always. Just trying out the desktop version...will see and review that later. Only one little thing...I REALLY HATE when my tasks cut of my ongoing calls. That must change. Otherwise 9 out 10 stars.",1
Best app for reminders. I have started using it before I started university to help remind me of important things and it has. There were times that if the app would not have reminded me I would have had problems like doctor appointments. I have been available to stay on top of things and stay organised. This reminder app is better than any other that I have tried. I can make lists and I can also put a specific time to remind me of the thing I need a reminder of. Highly recommended you try it!!!,1
This app keeps me productive! I have a tendency to try to tackle too much at once and end up with an overwhelming number of unfinished tasks. Any.do keeps me on task and helps me to prioritize what needs to come first. I love that it reminds me what needs to be done and I can snooze it nice that item to another day if needed. I live to add various lists so I know what my task pertains to. It's just an awesome resource for sure!,1
"I purchased premium almost immediately, as this is exactly what I've been looking for - simple to-do lists. Can repeat tasks, can set reminders, can add subtasks, can colour code, can sync with calendar, can have several lists - or can just ignore all that and use a simple dump-it-all perpetually ongoing to-do list. Love it. Can also use it from desktop on any OS (web interface), and it syncs quickly. There's a light mode with several colours available, and also night mode with a black background. Separately I would like to mention customer service. I was stuck in another country due to the pandemic, and my card got blocked. My bank took its blissful time to reissue and send a new card to me - meanwhile, all my subscriptions and bills bounced. I got a billing issue notification. I replied, explaining my situation, and any.do was very kind to provide a month of premium usage for free. Priority support replies are very prompt. The agent I was in contact with (Tali) is polite and quick. Overall, this app is a keeper. Finally a todo app that I use - because it doesn't annoy me.",1
"i've tried a lot of to-do list apps and this one is by far my favourite. The best part is that you can schedule a time for it to prompt you to plan your day and then it goes through all your tasks and allows you to triage and prioritize. Easy to use, and has a great free version. I only upgraded to the paid version because I wanted more flexibility with scheduling recurring tasks. All in all, an excellent app to get your life, business and brain organized.",1
Great app. Have been using it for quite a while now. It works well across my Android phone and my browser on my Macbook. I use it for tracking personal and work actions. I find the grocery list really useful. Easy to use and has most grocery items in its database so its very easy to populate. Had an issue with it closing lists by itself. Reached out to Any.do for support and they replied very quickly with the solution which required data clearance and reinstallation. Was worried about loss of data but the reinstall went very smoothly and all data came back from the Any.do server. Great service. Thanks Tali,1
"The best to do app on the market The free version is just perfect, no annoying ads and no missing features. The paid version is just as amazing, super cheap, super fast to use, every action is optimized, and the whole experience is great. I have a really hard time with my daily task and this app is a blessing. Helped me like nothing else. Also it syncs with calendar and computer which is greatly appreciated.",1
This app is great! So easy to enter information and at schedules. It links with my calendar and I can set reminders and move tasks around so easily. I love the front end which gives a clear overview of all tasks. Everything is so simple. There's no learning curve either - completely intuitive. Absolutely brilliant! They have thought of everything.,1
I've been using the free version of this app for a few weeks now and really like it. The design is beautiful and intuitive. My favourite and most useful feature is the anydo moment. Once a day the app lists your to dos and allows you to decide when you will do them. This is great because it allows you to prioritize on the go. Also love how easy it is to see both the to do lists and the calendar. I like this app so much I'm considering using the paid version for extra features.,1
"Without a doubt the best task organizer among dozens I have tried. Have been using it for years and I can't function without it. Very smooth overall user experience, functional and intuitive. It can be used as a simple to-do-list as well as a more sophisticated organizer. The dev team behind the app seem to be working actively as I notice regular updates and new features. If Google calendar is not your cup of tea, then the next thing to try would be Any.do, before anything else.",1
"So far, really f'ing good. I've tried a whole bunch of different todo apps, I've usually ended up parting ways with them for one reason or another --- but Any.Do is seeming to work with me really well. I love its simplicity, the fact that there's an accompanying web-app, and that you get a fully usable app for free and that you can unlock bonus (really cool) features as the premium. Give it a shot. See if it's worth you. If not, don't settle. Find something that works for you.",1
"The best! I have downloaded tons of to-do-list apps and this is hands down the best in its class. Simple and intuitive UI, easy to use, flexible, powerful and highly customizable while staying simple to use and understand. I tried other apps and I keep going back to Any.do everytime. I still have to find a worthy competitor to this app.",1
Very good application. There is a widget that allows you to enter in a new task with natural date and time language and it will properly decode and set the reminder. This makes it very fast to quickly add new tasks. Also the web app that accompanies it is very well made. My only gripe is that long tasks get cut off and you need to select them to read.,1
"I am satisfied with the app and the service. I am a free user but I get excellent service from the team when I encountered a bug. I didn't expect to get a reply from the developer but they replied me. (The bug: Sometimes events disappear after saving. Need to remake events several times. After contacting customer support, they told me to clear cache and reinstall it, and it worked flawlessly.) The app works smoothly, the design is simple, easy to use, and light. I like it.",1
"Throughout my busy life, I've used a lot of task management apps. This one is absolutely the best: elegant design, intuitive interface and complete feature set even without premium membership. The premium plan is, however, very affordable, and eventhough I personally don't need it, I probably will subscribe to it as a gesture of appreciation to the developer team. Great work!",1
Would love it if it had a widget for the grocery list.,1
"I do not have a single complaint. This app is one of the most important apps on my phone and has never given any trouble. It has helped my daily life and it is great for tasks, lists, appointments, reminders, to do lists from today, tomorrow, upcoming and then further into the future. You can add sub texts and smaller lists and information you need to remember within a single task. You can sync it's calendar with your calendar, and contacts as well as time and date. I highly recommend it!",1

Great for ADHD management. I'm a licensed therapist and I recommend this to my clients with ADHD.,1
I want to upgrade to premium subscription but I find no monthly billing...only yearly amount is debited initially itself..why? I would prefer monthly billing for 960.00 INR.,1
great,1
"the menu is odd at first. But not hard. The result was beyond my expectation. Eazy to create a widget (simple to choose size from 1 icon height to 4) The to do's are created with different mindset, let ur self be intuitive. Like posting 4twitter or facebook the prompt box suggests: ""I would like to..."" you type: ""call deb "" and boom you are shown choices of contcts to call or email addr. if texting...your widget will display a beatifully noise free legible agenda. Golden ;-]",1
Great app simple and straightforward everything I need it to do.,1
good and easy to use and enhance productivity,1
nice,1
why doesn't it remove item from list after checking it off.,1
excellent organiser for work related task,1
This app feels very intuitive to use and I love how the user flows are all well connected. I like that every next task that makes sense logically sort of shows up at the end of every completed user flow within the app. It's a smooth user experience. I just downloaded it so I still need to test it out more.,1
"A to do list where you can schedule each task in time with a reminder - or just keep it as a 'someday' - and easily switch in-between. Which is awesome! It has a super-low threshold to create a task, which makes you actually use it. Plus if you don't want to flip through menus to schedule you can just write date & time in plain language! Or speak it, using your Assistant. I know Any.do can do much more than this, but that's what I use it for. Oh, plus, also its intelligent grocery list!",1
"Even as a free user this is still a pretty powerful tool. It has almost everything I need in a to do list. My only complaint is default predictive features designed to help, but instead complicating simple tasks, i.e. a task with a holiday in the title sets a due date of the holiday. Thankfully a nice developer quickly responded to a previous review with a work around, but it would be nice if this were a bit more intuitive. Edited to change rating and add thanks to the developer.",1
"Would love an easy access pure calendar view, especially if also available in widget form. I know this is more of a tasks app than a calendar app but theres really no reason why it cant have a simple dedicated calendar as well. Also, the Android widget still doesnt sync with the system light/dark mode. Otherwise, its perfect. I've been using Todoist for years and I can't imagine ever going back to life without it. It's the smoothest and most consistent tasks app out there.",1
"On android it would be very helpful to provide SelectAll feature in any list. Similar to as in the iOS app. For example, when any filter is applied I cannot select all the items in the result on android app but it works in iOS app. Second request: It would be very nice to have collapsible headings when we group by using project or due date. It would make easier to check a long list of items. Defect: Android app crashing when trying to create a new label.",1
"Once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to use. I like the labels features alot as well. It's easier to navigate through tasks by just searching the label. The widgets are also very efficient.",1
"Good app, needs an option to disable the 'reschedule' option that appears if you don't do a task. I just want to start at a blank screen each day and not be nagged by the app to reschedule something that was day-specific to begin with.",1
"I loved it until the latest update. I was using the karma view to help keep track of recently completed tasks, and that particular piece of usability is now hidden more than it was before, and I needed instructions to find it again, the process was not at all intuitive.",1
Please bring back the old mobile dark theme for the widget! I loved the minimalist look with no colors and the ability to turn the opacity down completely. Would be 5/5 stars with this design feature back in place.,1
"1. When I reschedule a recurring task (like for later time the same day) it loses the ""recurring"" trait, which has been a source of much confusion over recurring tasks ""disappearing"" after they are completed. This is not an issue if I reschedule such task by clicking buttons like ""tomorrow"". There should be a warning if a task is about to lose this trait.",1
Can't login in the app. I have to use the web version of this app. Update: with new version login via Google account was fixed. üëç,1
"Brilliant app. Uncluttered and easy to use. It works offline too which is important to me as I live in an area with unstable internet connectivity. For me, perfection will be to see long-term, repeatable and annual tasks.",1
Pretty good. My only issue that would prevent me from replacing my current notes app is the lack of long press (3D) to do a New Task/Item. Please add. Thank you!,1
"Great app, but you guys nerfed the widget design in the most recent update. Before you could make the entire widget transparent. It was clean and blended in well with the background but now the header is no longer transparent and it just looks bad on the home screen.",1
No complaints. Does the job. And the widget is a good reminder. Overall will increase productivity.,1
"Im enjoying this app, but is anyone else unable to open the app right now? I haven't been able to for a few hours now Update on review: developpers were aware, responded, and fixed the problem within a day. Very reliable",1
Please bring back the option to create recurring reminders on the app. The old way of setting up reminders was far more intuitive than this one.,1
"Workspace feature is awesome. But it would be nice to have it out of team scope as well, so not to have a ""5 projects"" limit. I do agree that you want more money from Teams. But I want workspaces for my personal use only, so why would I pay extra than I pay for Pro already?",1
"My experience with todoist is very good, the mechanism is simple yet helpful and it's very easy to learn. But my only problem is the projects, why is there only 5 projects for the ""non premium"" users? Why don't make it 10? Anyways 4/5 stars is reasonable for me.",1
"I've been using Todoist for years, and it has served me well for managing my life tasks. There are some quirks that annoy me, but not enough to make me want to switch.",1
"Todoist is the truly the best to-do app available in the market, especially in terms of its NLP and integrations. I mean it. My issue is with the pricing plans. As a simple user who uses other tools for notes and collaboration, the only useful premium feature for me would be the reminders, which honestly aren't worth the price asked. There are tools like Notion that offers better collaboration features in a more competitive price. I'd prefer a cheaper tier without all these advanced stuff.",1
Great app. I'd like to be able to do more to rext though than just bold & italicize; I'd like to be able to underline text and strike-through text in my notes/tasks as well!!,1
"Very nice if you want a simple to-do list like I do, though I haven't experienced the 'projects' part of the app because I prefer to keep it simple and don't feel the need for it, I hear that people don't dislike it, for me you can still do real nice tracking of your tasks without the pro version.",1
"this works very well for me, as i use my phone alot, and so it makes sense for me to have a list on my phone. I also share it with my parents for accountability. I do not have the premium as i see no use in it. I have my own calendar, and I actually have on this list ""create schedule on calendar"" and for me, it works. i wIuld recommend plaing this app next to another app so you can remind yourself to check it, as for, i forget a lot, so when i play a game, this app is right next to it to remind",1
"Hello, the problem is that, in the project section, when a person completes one of the options, that option is completed for everyone, while there should be the ability for each person to select that option individually. to finish or create a sign that shows how many people finish the action",1
"It is quite an useful app for me. However it could be better with little upgradation in terms of quick gestures to schedule the tasks, speedy way to rearrange today's chores instead of press and hold and drag slowly.",1
"Finally a great minimalist app. I have tried a lots of app and was fedup and almost had planned to create an app myself untill I found this. Not quiet there yet but very close.

Many fancy gimmicks can be added but u'll be lost in manageming, maintaining the todolist itselft. This app is quick, less number clicks, just enough for minimilst n lazy like me!",1
"The main bug is once you've added a task, it is impossible to amend it as the 'Save' button greys out and any changes you make will not be saved. A test case is to try to change a one-off task due today into a repeating daily task, it recognises the modification by changing the font to a repetitive taak, but then you click save and nothing happens. If you exit out, you see the 'discard / cancel' options only. UPDATE I've sent you all the info previously with screenshots and nothing was fixed.",1
The app is really good if you are going to organize tasks by using priority flags. the best part is that I can use it on nearly any device. I recommend using this app for anyone who wants a more organized tasklist to focus. the only thing that I would like to come for free is the notification reminder. It would be cool as I'm a broke kid,1
"If you're looking for an app that allows you to set a rigid schedule, with lots of easily accessible settings, this is not for you. I'll still give 4 stars because it's a well-made app, but I was very disappointed that it seems centered on quickly writing down short tasks, which is not what I'm looking for in a planner at all. Also, locking reminders behind a paywall is a bit much for a planner imo.",1
"This is a great app, but over the past couple of years the price has risen to a point where I can't justify it. It has wonderful features, but some of the basic ones, such as reminders, are behind the subscription paywall. If you look at the feature set and think you'd make good use out of the extras it has over similar apps it will likely be worth it for you, but if a more basic lower cost option suits your needs you'll be fine paying less.",1
"It's free, and even without a paid subscription, you get a lot of helpful qualities, like easy organization and reminders to complete tasks or projects. The only reason I didn't give a fifth star is, you can't ask for reminders on certain days of the week, like every Tuesday and Thursday at noon or something. You can only do one day a week, or daily, or every other day reminders of tasks. Other than that, I would highly recommend it. I'm using it to organize my homework. üëç",1
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.,1
"Well if there is a way to remove the history of all the items added by default (download aps, awnser questions, etc) I'd bring this to 5. Some people don't like unnecessary clutter anywhere. I don't want these on my to-do list. Beyond that I realize I have only one thing really to do. Thanks lol",1
"I've been using Todoist for years. It's a good task tracking app, and I really like the ""smart"" ability for creating recurring tasks (can get weird with it lol). My biggest/only complaint is that it is impossible to undo an accidental completion of a recurring task. It's simple enough to ""reset"" the next due date of the task, but it still counts toward my daily and weekly goals üòÆ‚Äçüí®",1
"Todoist works great for keeping a couple on track together. The ability to group tasks, have automatic recurring items with natural language entry, and quickly move an over due task to a renewed due date straight from the widget are great.",1
"I've been using Todoist for years, and it has served me well for managing my life tasks. There are some quirks that annoy me, but not enough to make me want to switch.",1

"UPDATE 3: Rescinding the fifth star. UPDATE 2: Screw it. I'm giving you the fifth star, solely because your update notes *actually* say what you're fixing/changing. UPDATE: 3 years later, and this is still my app of choice. I've tried most other task management apps that provide cross-platform syncing, but none of them works as well as Todoist. Despite this, I still think the annual pricing is a little expensive for the few pro features I use, but overall I'm happy with this app.",1
"My experience with todoist is very good, the mechanism is simple yet helpful and it's very easy to learn. But my only problem is the projects, why is there only 5 projects for the ""non premium"" users? Why don't make it 10? Anyways 4/5 stars is reasonable for me.",1
"Workspace feature is awesome. But it would be nice to have it out of team scope as well, so not to have a ""5 projects"" limit. I do agree that you want more money from Teams. But I want workspaces for my personal use only, so why would I pay extra than I pay for Pro already?",1
I don't like that it tries to put a limit on my words,1
Great planner app but recently the search feature for tasks crashes the app everytime for me.,1
i like it,1

Please bring back the option to create recurring reminders on the app. The old way of setting up reminders was far more intuitive than this one.,1
"Even as a free user this is still a pretty powerful tool. It has almost everything I need in a to do list. My only complaint is default predictive features designed to help, but instead complicating simple tasks, i.e. a task with a holiday in the title sets a due date of the holiday. Thankfully a nice developer quickly responded to a previous review with a work around, but it would be nice if this were a bit more intuitive. Edited to change rating and add thanks to the developer.",1
definitely keeps me on top of my tasks and helps me feel as if I'm being productive. the way you can categorize and prioritize tasks according to your goals and projects definitely helps me stay on track and focus on what I want to focus on at certain times. the only con is that the constant updates makes it hard to keep up with how the interface works and I'm constantly having to learn where things have been moved to.,1
"UPDATE: I got tired of waiting on support so I uninstalled. When I reinstalled, it finally worked. But still... That's twice in 2 months you've pushed a broken update, and twice you've crashed my business productivity. Todoist is great. But it has to work, and new updates need tested before they're pushed out to avoid this problem in the future.",1
Great app. I'd like to be able to do more to rext though than just bold & italicize; I'd like to be able to underline text and strike-through text in my notes/tasks as well!!,1
Can't login in the app. I have to use the web version of this app. Update: with new version login via Google account was fixed. üëç,1
it's very user friendly and helps get personal tasks online like outlook does for your work tasks,1

"Great app, it is not completely free, but still useful.",1
amazing app I can schedule my tasks and utilise time,1
No complaints. Does the job. And the widget is a good reminder. Overall will increase productivity.,1
great app,1
"On android it would be very helpful to provide SelectAll feature in any list. Similar to as in the iOS app. For example, when any filter is applied I cannot select all the items in the result on android app but it works in iOS app. Second request: It would be very nice to have collapsible headings when we group by using project or due date. It would make easier to check a long list of items. Defect: Android app crashing when trying to create a new label.",1
great at organizing yourself,1

"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.",1
It's great! Honestly the best project management tool that I've been lucky enough to find. That being said I do have one gripe. I can not for the life of me figure out where an up to date list of free and premium features are. It says that 80 projects are supported in free(total overkill but hey) I got stopped at five. How many are in premium? Does the alert work in premium? Gcal sync by labels? Edit: good info in reply. Upped stars to 5/5 from 4. Rest of review unchanged.,1
"I occasionally check out other list tools, buy come back to this one. The full UI works great, but the widget doesn't work that well on Android 12 - it behaves far better on my tablet stuck on Android 10. On my phone it often double/triple reloads, and some reloads just spin until opening the app. Plus, either due to that or having a smaller phone, I mostly fail trying to mark the completion bubble. bubble.",1
This is a great system! I'm pretty disorganized so I'm of the opinion that if it works for me and the mess of my life that exists it must work for everybody. The only thing it needs is an inbuilt monthly calendar. PARTICULARLY for events/appointments. Also while I am aware that reminders are for premium only (and as such are not a factor for losing a star) i am slightly unsure whether or not the reminder works like an alarm system where it will buzz at the time that you have set for the event.,1
"Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.",1
"Reliable, flexible, easy to use. I have more flexibility in organizing my to-do list the way I want to see it, and still use GTD. Only minor drawback: wish there was another way to set repeating tasks other than putting it into words. Putting it into words might seem easier than the menus seen om most other To Do apps, but you have to put the words in a precise way and even then it might still take a few tries before Todoist picks up the repeat request.",1
I love this app and I count on it to keep me organized but am not crazy about the latest update. I love that my list appears larger and easier to read but I don't like how it automatically deletes it when an item is hit. I've accidently lost items on my grocery list several times. It has left me feeling less secure that I've crossed everything off my list.,1
"Very positive so far. Installed the app about a week ago and it took a couple of days before I felt entirely comfortable with it. The learning curve is very modest overall, it's one the few to-do list applications that's truly multiplatform. It have it installed on my iPad, Windows PC and Android phone (OK already! I kno6, and so far it has performed brilliantly. I'll update this eval if I run into any issues. but so far so good. Highly recommended...",1
"Updated review to 4 stars from 1. The usability was very poor, but I looked online, and on youtube and eventually solved main problem. It was that when I made subtasks in Today view, they remained as original, but also in the new list as well (subtasked only there)! So I had a lot of duplicates. I stand by my earlier assertion that this is very poor usability from a new user's point of view. Also, I upgraded to premium and it is annoying that they charge 30 dollars up front (annual), instead of a reasonable monthly charge. However it is proving helpful and I look forward to future changes as well. Original review: Poorly designed, subtasks listed in a nonsensical manner. Doing basic things such as un-checking items a hassle.",1
"A few days in and so far so good. Definitely has a few non-intuitive functions. Setting custom reminders is weird...a pop-up should just appear to select a date and time, but instead you type it in then it tries to interpret what you type, then you select it if it is right. Very convoluted. Finally found the task completion statistics. Its next to your profile icon/picture when clicking on the three horizontal lines top left. Small circle with squiggly arrow with some numbers next to it.",1
It does what it needs to. I just wish instead of email notifications when things were over due that I would get push notifications instead. I think it is hard to balance having a free tool and a paid version for something like this and the free version gives you the bare minimum. I dont know how the paid version would provide me with any better service as an individual than the free version aside from push notifications.,1
"Best to do list I've found. I used to use Trello but it didn't work for me. This does everything Trello didn't. Love the Inbox and how i can access it from a widget on my phone with one press. Also i have the other widget that shows my list of choice. I love how you can schedule items just by typing when you want them, even if it repeats. It's a very smooth interface. A few of the premium features would be really nice to have. It's tempting but i don't like recurring fees. I'd rather pay once.",1
"Mostly pros but one big con.. Absolutely love this app. It is really is user friendly and has helped me so much with organizing my life. One big con though is I had a big issue with the Google calendar integration. I had to disconnect it as it messed up my calendar and I lost a bunch of data that I needed to reenter. Luckily, it was uploaded to todoist so I didn't have to hunt for it. I really hope they fix that issue.",1
"I've been using todoist for years now and it's nice being able to access my list from my phone or computer. Bad news is that with the latest update, the ""add task"" widget won't work. It said the app doesn't exist, so I tried to remove the widget and place it again, but it makes the Home UI crash every time. It did the same thing on my husband's phone.",1
"It's a fine task manager app, a little bit hard to get at first with the weird natural language based task creation, but if you're willing to put in the effort it's pretty intuitive. The one big deal breaker for me is that if you have a daily recurring task it becomes overdue at midnight. If you tap it complete after midnight, it completes it for the next day which ends up with you missing a day unless you remember to do it on your own or manually set the next recurrence to today.",1
"It is a great to do app that takes a little while to find all the customization possibilities for, but when you do it works wonderfully, and even the free version is clean with no ads as I'm writing this. The biggest change I'd like to see is the ability to visualize progress through goals, daily tasks and overall projects in a more helpful way that shows the percent progress made in each priority level.",1
"Truly my favorite to-do list app I've ever tried. My one small quibble is that it always has trouble accepting multiple keywords, for example if it's Monday and I need to set up an items that is weekly on Tuesdays, I can't just type ""Tuesday weekly"" but have to go tinker around in the settings. I'd also like more customization over the look, with fonts and colors.",1
"I rely on this app daily for all my personal to do lists. But recent changes to functionality have made it less friendly to use than when I first got it.  For example it's much harder to add a time. Whenever I add a time to a task, it assumes I want to do it today, and I have to go back in and change it back to the original day.   Another annoyance is I can never use the word ""march"" in a task (like the March for Science) because the app thinks I mean the month. There are other words that happens with too, I can't recall them all right now.  Also like another use I don't like the circles on the left to check off the tasks, I keep deleting them accidentally.",1
"After trying *so* many different time management apps (even the $200/yr ones), this one the best. I love that the date you type in the add task bar automatically assigns it to the date. You can set events, tasks, and reminders all with voice to text while driving! The only thing I'd *love* is a more conventional ""calendar"" view where I can easily see what's in store for the month with one glance. Keep up the good work!",1
"I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there. There has been some quirky behavior introduced over the last few months, especially around rescheduled occurrences of recurring tasks, and it's been a bit frustrating there. But overall, it's the best app for me and the team behind it seem like great people based on my interactions. Give it a shot!",1
"Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.",1
"Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either. So, no backward search for the events, calendar sharing and other integrations. Well, task and project-wise, this is a powerhouse! Much more simple and well designed than Google Keep I've been using for years.",1
"Great todo app with minimalistic UI, however there is a bit of missing potential. The app is fairly full of features, however for key things like notifications you aren't given many settings to customize them. Another example is you can't have tasks auto-scheduled based on the project it is in or the labels it has. I paid for a subscription (only $4) to test out labels and everything this app and the desktop version offered and I was a bit underwhelmed by the lack of automation features.",1
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget.",1
"I really like this app... It's unique in that the commands are very simple and it can recognize plain-text times and dates, and organizing each entry into sections, or ""projects"" is easy. I would recommend setting up the app online or on a computer because managing projects and sub-projects is difficult within the app. My one regret is that the app is broken up into calendar days. I, and a few others don't necessarily consider it ""tomorrow"" until I've gone to sleep and woken up the next day. I'll have a daily task, like reading, that can float through my day... often times I'll get it done in the might before I go to bed, other times it'll happen in the afternoon when I have free time. I can schedule my reading task daily, but if I complete the task at 12 AM on the night of November 1st, it counts as ""tomorrow"" and won't automatically reappear until November 3rd. I propose that Todoist have a night-owl setting, in which we late-nighters can define when our days end. I don't want my reading to count for November 2 if I'm completing the task for November 1 before I've gone to sleep. I don't want Todoist to skip that task to November 3 even if it is the next calendar day because I won't have done my reading for November 2. I wish that we would be able to define our 24 hour period as one day instead of solely relying on Calendar dates.",1
"It is an effective todo app with some unique and useful features. Paying $3/month for the premium subscription might be worth it...I'm still deciding on this app vs Wunderlist, the one I've used previously. Predictive typing for things like ""by today at 5pm"" is great but the free version has limited capabilities with reminders. Happily, no ads. It works nice between multiple platforms which is essential, especially since you can key things in on the PC VERY quickly. Karma points help motivate.",1
"I'm not 100% happy with how it's set up, but it's working well enough to help keep me organized. Since it's a web based app, I can still access my info when my phone acts up, and I won't lose all my data again the next time my phone craps out and I have to do a factory reset. My main complaint is that it doesn't work exactly the same as the other app that I'm already used to, but that one didn't reliably back up and I lost my data one too many times. I'll get used to this one.",1
"Great app. I pay for the subscription because I find the app invaluable for creating structure in my life. However, there was a recent update that changed how reminders are set, and while I do like the new feature, I wish they didn't remove the old one that allowed you to type a specific reminder with your keyboard. For example, I used to be able to type in something like, ""every other Sunday at 8am"", but now I can only select a specific date and time unless I use Todoist on my PC.",1
Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 10/23 edit update. Giving another star back cause it's 4 years later and I still use this app everyday so obviously useful. Recently have had an issue with it not opening up occasionally but for some reason opens if I go to Google play store and open from there. Odd/annoying but still useful and will likely be fixed like the previous issue was which caused me to rate it lower.,1
Great software. Excellent as a widget but your newest update needs keyboard focus immediately activated on clicking the search button like it always has. If it goes away which it seems to do more often than before as well...arbitrarily just turned 40 task searches a day into 80-120 unnecessary clicks. It's not even clear where the form is looking around the screen (there at the top) Repeatedly pressing search button again waiting for the keyboard to open up so I can actually begin searching,1
"This is an amazing app for my ADHD, I love it. But some updates make it weird to use. With the latest update, if I make ""laundry"" a task, then make a new task ""Sweep floors"" it will put ""laundry"" as soon as I start typing. If I use a label, sometimes there is no label unless I tap on the task to enlarge the view. Some tasks show the entire label ""Medical"" on regular view, other tasks show ""Me..."" and it gets annoying. Overall amazing otherwise. Also would love to see more colors for labels.",1
"I really like this app and use it everyday. However, these new Pop Ups that come out of nowhere congratulating me on checking off tasks are incredibly annoying. I don't need a digital pat on the back. Maybe some people like that and that's great. Personally, I just want to keep checking off tasks or looking at what's next to do and these pop ups just get in the way of that and irritate me. Can you please make it so I can turn them off? I've searched the settings and I can't find it anywhere.",1
The app itself is good but the voice integration on Android is not intuitive nor powerful. I have to jump through several hoops to get my task logged and it often ends up wrong. This might be an issue with Google as well. But I am looking for a quick way to get tasks logged when I can't type. Instead I find my self fumbling to press buttons again...,1
"Awesome App overall. I like how you can create separate lists for different categories. However I'd appreciate if the subtasks could be reworked to allow for the main tasks and the subtasks to be marked as completed separately. The reason I use subtasks in the first place is because they're related to my main task, yet I need to complete them at different times than the main task. Right now if I mark one as complete, the whole thing is marked as complete, which defeats the purpose.",1
"i love this app very much! its organization is so efficient and i love how you can automate recurring tasks and the projects are so amazing! will be looking into possibly getting premium. my only thing is i wish there was more graphics/fonts/theme options. I understand simplicity is the premise, but I like having a pretty schedule or at least a personal looking one. even if not, a pink theme for premium please üò≠ but other than that it is a fantastic app!!",1
"Great app, very helpful for me. I have a very mentally demanading job and have to keep alot of tasks organized. Todoist help me keep everything in order so I dont forget anything. However, I'm using it on my Samsung Note 10 plus. I've done some research and I'm being told that android will not sync to the Google calendar. I just have the free app on my phone, and know I can still use it with the dex, but if there is a way I can sync it to Google calendar please let me know.",1
"Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work.",1
"Has almost all of the functionality I wanted out of a to-do list. The sentence interpretation towards repeated tasks is intuitive and well implemented. More nebulous tasks such as ""first weekend of the month"" don't seem to work, but that's a minor issue given the robust nature of the rest of the app.",1
"I'll always miss Wunderlist, but I'm very grateful that I found Todoist! üëå My only problem is that I keep exiting the app when I try to go ""back"" a page after entering a task. Am I missing something, or do I have to get used to it? ü•¥ Reply to developer:Thanks for responding! I usually hit the home button to leave, but when I want to truly kill/exit other apps, I go ""back"" from the *main* page. I see the page that lists all projects as main. It's the top of the tree & has the settings gear.",1
"I don't write reviews. However, when Todoist, my most used App prompted me for the first time to rate them, how could I say no? This app has basically changed my life, giving me an outlet to bettet manage my schedule and my time in a simple, yet effective manner. Personally, I do not use the more complex tools like ""Projects"" but, even for the free users (I'm one) this is a wondeful tool. My favorite feature is the ability to flag different priority levels for different assignments.",1
I love thus App! We use it as a team at work and it helps us get things done! We dont forget projects plus we can see who has completed what and it does 85% of everthing I want it to do and it does it well. The two things I hope they add is the ability to wtite notes and have monthy views with out the need of your calander. If they do that it would do everthing that I want 100% of the ways I wouf like to use it. That would bring my rating up to 5 stars,1
"It is the only app I have found that integrates 2way with Google calendar. With this, tasks can show up as events in my calendar and I can edit them in both apps. Apart from that, it has many great useful features that I regularly use, such as: categorizing tasks (project level as well as section level), prioritizing tasks, sub tasks, comments within tasks. A minor complain would be that you can't move around multiple tasks at once and that there is no native Linux app.",1
"Im a notorious list jumper (always trying to find the best app for managing my to dos) and ive been using todoist for over 2 years. The only downside for me is a lack of dependent tasks and id really like to see it incorporated in the future, along with ""hide until"" or "" start dates"" both available in other apps and would increase the clean interface for those that care to use them. despite that, still the best app out there. Kudos as well for keeping accessibility in mind during development",1
"This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now)",1
"Easy way to sync google calendar with Thunderbird calendar. I was looking for a way to carry Thunderbird task list with me. Todoist allows me to sync tasks between devices. The only thing is that the Todoist tasks end up syncing with Thunderbird ""all day"" appointments, rather than showing up on the task list. The good thing is, when you log into Todoist on phone and mark tast as completed, it comes off the Thunderbird calendar.",1
"Can't share in typical fashion. Can't easily flip through attachments. 1. No share menu option on item-level. Android design pattern users expect ""Share"" item. Share to Google Photos' Share button great example. App MixNote's great Share example: popup ""Share by text"" or ""Share by picture"". Your ""Add reaction, Copy, Edit, Delete"" isn't cutting it. 2. Attachments, ugh. Can't just swipe through item attachments. Have to back out of view, select next photo to view. Yuck. MixNote does right, IMO.",1
"its kind of odd, imo, that a todo app doesnt automatically include notifications unless you pay for premium. however they do offer integration into my calendar app, which DOES notify me, after a fashion. the widget allows you to switch between all sorts of views. love the natural language for setting thibgs up, general ease of adding a task and categorizing it, the ""postpone"" feature i just discovered, ease of editing, reoccurring subtasks can have different intervals than the overarching task..",1
"Task sections with a ""/‚Äù in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",1
"I really enjoy this app! The design is very simple and well put together. The cute designs of people enjoying their day when I finish tasks is almost rewarding, and it's nice when the app tells me to enjoy my day off when I have no tasks. I like that I can color-code things and add subtasks, as well as create different priority levels for tasks. The only thing I wish it had was a monthly view. Then I would give it 5 stars.",1
"Great app, gets the job done and helps organize assignments, only thing that I would like would be if the widget had rounded corners and maybe have an option for a sort of blur background to make the widget look more modern and appealing. Everything works perfectly, definitely recommend.",1
Having one place for all my lists and projects has been really enjoyable. I would probably like the premium better for more accurate and times reminders but otherwise the basic todoist app is really nice. Being able to share a project with my hubby is helpful so we can split up during shopping while checking off the same list.,1
"Im in love with this app! However, being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband's device for just notification feels a little bit wrong. I think for something like a to-do list notification should not be a premium feature. There is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and I have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite. It is so clean, simple, easy to use, and it does recurring todos",1
"I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I'd probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They're given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.",1
A little difficult to get the hang of. But all in all a great app. Only issue I'm having is that my recurring subtasks show up twice on my daily checklist which clutters up the list. The duplicates also appear outside the main task so I can't unexpand them to clear up the clutter. Other than that everything works well so far.,1
"Great simple app ! I have free version now. I probably need to get the premium version to duplicate and move tasks. Some questions : Does it allow the moving or duplicating of subtasks to another task ... or the elevating of a subtask to be a task or vice versa. Also, are reminders sent as notifications or sound or both.? Also, does it keep a log of completed tasks and/or subtasks. and if so, can you view or export it in some way? With these features it's a 5 ‚≠ê app‚ùó",1
"This app is the best todo list app. I have used this for almost 5 years I think, and it's been great for me and my husband. A todo list cannot get better than this one. However, my life circumstances have changed. This only works when I can do things, not when I want to give jobs to others. I have a kid now, and there are the family schedule, individual member's schedules, plus important things to always have in hand (notes), etc. Thank you todoist and good bye. [Edit below] We've moved to Twist",1
Prepare to pay. It looks like a very useful app if you pay for it. The basic features I have access to for free are good; easy to use & had a nice front end user experience. I can't give 5 stars because I'm not going to pay to access the extra features when I can use Samsung Notes for free for the same basic abilities. I don't need it bad enough to pay.,1
"I have a notes app built into my phone that I use. I researched and found an article where someone tried 4 different to do list options. This one sounded best to me, as most people, like me, usually have their phone right there. But my notes app also has where I can put things in the order I'd like to do them. If you can add that feature, I'll try again.",1
Its good. WAY better than when I first tried it. The features are excellent. Esp because I use it mainlie for life stuff and to get the functionality it offers most productivity apps make you pay a per user fee. I've tried about 9 in the past year and a half so im prettie confident in the quality of Todoist. Runner up Asana as a for instance doesn't automatically remove completed tasks on their free version... bananas.,1
"I love todoist.... I have stuck with this software longer than its competitors. I gave it 4 stars because I want more themes( nature, full dark mode themes, more colors like even soft pinks, lavender, powder blue) I would love an alarm on my tasks because reminders just dont catch my attention. I would love to be able to make list with checkboxes or numbers in comments on a task. I wish this app had a timer on each task as well. I love this app.",1
"Very handy app. They are tons of tips and tutorials about how to get it to practically sit up and roll over. Really does help with productivity. Works with Alexa for the most part too. Updated now that I've used it for a while. I have the Pro version now, and it's very handy, especially for looking back at completed tasks. I know there are lots of tricks I don't know yet, but I do recommend this product.",1
"I love this app and use it mainly for a to-do list/remember this list. The only problem that I have experienced is, it's quite sensitive. When I mistakenly touch something and it deletes, it is gone. Sometimes it happened so quickly I don't even know what I just deleted. I wish there was a ""deleted files box"" that it went to so that I could restore that which I mistakenly deleted, which could be emptied later at my decision. Other than that, it is a wonderful program and I do recommend it.",1
"Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!",1
decent app for phone use although there are better options that offer more features for free if you strictly want to use only one phone. what makes this stand out is the integration with other devices such as android wear which allows you to add and complete tasks from your watch and easily see the next task you need to complete.,1
"I bought a new planner around the same time I started using Todoist. I used the planner for about a week. I find with Todoist, the planner is no longer useful to me. The use of tags helps me organize my work and plan my day. It's also very easy to move a task from one day to the next. In my planner, it seemed I was constantly re-writing tasks to the next day and would often lose sight of them. I also like that I can keep notes within a task. This helps me remember any progress or delays.",1
"Please get rid of the check mark boxes or give us an option to opt back to swiping. Other than that, I've been using and loving this app for years! It is exactly what I need as a college student, worker, mom, and just someone who likes keeping household tasks in order. I could only love this app and widget more if you got rid of those check mark boxes, please! I accidentally hit like 5 items in one day alone. thanks!",1
"I have tried numerous task apps. This one works the best for me. It's intuitive, and it has task and calendar widgets, that are adjustable to your phone's color schemes for your screen to remind you of your schedule and still be pretty. Only thing that could make it even better is if finished tasks would be moved to the bottom of tasks. Now they stay in their old spot, scattered all over the list.",1
"I tried over 15 apps and this one is so far the best one I tried, even without the subscription. The design is good, it's super intuitive, not confusing. The options ""All tasks"" and ""Next 7 days"" are the ""highlight"" for me. I'd however improve few things, such as adding a second option for the calendar, which would be a timetable, an overview of the week. My biggest problem with the app is that there is no perpetual sub option, which I'd definitely choose and I'd stick with any. do for good.",1
"I love this app, it looks stunning and clean which personally is important to me, and everything works smoothly as intended- setting reminders for tasks, repetition, notes, etc. One thing I'd like is for ""subtasks"" to be able to appear on the main task page under the main task, maybe a button to toggle this. If there already is, I'm not sure how to access it. Other than that, I'm excited to use the app to be more organized.",1
"Excellent app and honestly my life would be so disorganised without it. Really helps me to stay on track. My only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day, week, 2 weeks, etc. (E.g. Allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days. Like Mondays and Wednesdays for instance.) Otherwise the app is sublime. If this small detail is added then I see no reason to withhold my 5 start reading from you. Great app.",1
"When I edit the notes section of a task, the editable field is very small, very hard to add something. Please fix this, it is very hard to use and notes is something I use a lot Ideal expected behaviour is to edit in the exieting section which is already full screen, not to have a pop-up. In the pop-up you have to scroll down where you want to add or modify something",1
"Very useful, I am someone who constantly needs to write to-do lists for the day as I am forgetful and this app is simple and easy to use. I add a task for any particular date and cross it out when I'm done. You can also set times so the app reminds you, which is very helpful. I recommend so as to not use paper to write down lists all the timeüëç",1
"Lovely app. One problem though, billing is yearly. An option for monthly payments should be made available. Even if it's just for the first 2 months only and then maybe quarterly after that. Still not sure I wanna make a commitment for such a long time frame after a 7 day trial. Edit: On it right away. Thanks guys. üëäüèæ",1
Subscription and Customer Service I used this app at the recommendation of a friend. I purchased a subscription plan several years ago. I contacted customer service this year as I saw a charge on my credit card and I did not realize I had still been paying for the subscription. For several years. Turns out my subscription was renewed automatically. The customer service team was great and I received a refund without any hassle. I'm very happy with their service.,1
very hard to use without pay but dont pay!,1
"Hi there, I've just started using the app and it's great! Just so that I already got the premium version! It's just great so far and I have nothing to complain about. The reason I'm giving 4 stars (for now) is for the fact that there's one major feature I really need that I can't find it on Any.do: The ability to setup a reminder for a different timezone. For example, I want a reminder to go off whenever US stock market opens (9:30 ET) independent on what country I am.Is that possible on Any.do?",1
I love this app but am having one big problem...while ticking off items with the app open the app often closes and has to be restarted. If I use the widget to tick items off it doesn't happen...but then I can't use the widget to create new items for all of my lists because there is nowhere to select the list I want to add to so a new item goes to the default list...so I have keep switching between the widget and the app. I submitted a bug report some time ago but nothing happened.,1
"This app used to be amazing for staying organised. It syncs with your Google calendar so everything can be in one place. My favourite feature was in the morning it will help you plan your day and choose what tasks you'll be doing, and it would play a cute jingle with a motivational message at the end. It doesn't do that anymore and now keeps trying to making me create a team workspace which is not why I use it.",1
"Absolutely wonderful. This app is so helpful. I love that it integrates with so many apps so easily. All I had to do was link my Google accounts and all my events were there. The only thing that sucks is that you can't share calendars the way you can share lists. It'd be great so that instead of having to constantly talk about it, my family could coordinate schedules right in this app. If not for that, I would've gave 5 stars.",1
"Hello, please an Recycle Bin is a must! I just delete a task by mistake and inside them I have valuable information, now is gone :(",1
"This is the best To Do list app / orginiler that I used by far. I like the fact that it is cross-platform, it's quite intuitive and easy to use. Regarding issues, I think that the design could be a bit better and cleaner, and there are a few small glitches like the fact that the order of tasks is not being updated according to time right after and you have to refresh it. Otherwise, a great app!",1
What's up with the ap creating a grocery list? Products that I not only don't use but stuff I've never heard of. Went through support a while back and they told me to clear the cache. It's still keeps creating this list.,1
Nice app with cool UI and features but not for me. -The notification is rather obstructive when I need to call quicky but have to snooze several pending notifications. - Worst is when the notification appears during typing and I accidentally tap on some button. The notification disappears but I do not know what action on which task I selected. - Default snooze options provide in app are just not enough.,1
"Great app to be organized! (1) The whatsapp feature is fantastic - super easy to set reminders on the move, on the laptop via whatsapp web, & very effective to make sure I don't miss anything. (2) the widgets aren't great. I have a widget on my phone home screen/ Tab & the date doesn't automatically change so sometimes I'm looking at yesterday's tasks/calendar & I have to manually open the app - correct it... I can't seem to tick off the tasks from the widget. I have to open the app. Irritating!",1
"I've used this app for many years with good experience. Lately the UX and complexity have caused some problems, nonetheless, new features have been very good. However, with the latest update I can no longer see tasks planned for tomorrow, a feature that was the reason for using this app to begin with. It's just gone with no possibility to configure it again. I do understand development of new features, but I do not appreciate removal of features that are being used. Great app, not for me anymore",1
"It's OK but it's not for me. I'm a student and cannot pay for an upgrade in the app. The free options are a bit limited so I, had to delete this app. Hope you enjoy it thoüòä Edit: Thank you for replying. I will make sure to give it another try and re-rate it depending on my second experience :) 2nd edit: it's very helpful. It does what it's created for: planning and keeping your life organized. And with reminders for us forgetful people . BravoüòÅ I still feel like its missing something...",1
"One of the best apps there, recursive, monthly check list to do, even with sub-tasks. Good job. I'm giving just 4 stars because notifications are too much, you need to consolidate them in just one expandable and also because ""do later"" or ""done"" pop ups are a little strange, you can check a do later time for first one or something like that but not everything.",1
"Very useful for day to day and repeatable tasks. Only problem I've had is when some repeating tasks stop displaying notifications and I have to delete them and re-enter them, which is a massive waste of time, especially when you have quite a few different ones set up. Edit: it seems reinstalling the app fixes this issue.",1
"I generally like the app, moving from Calengoo(a great app) after 6 years. I used a trial version of this app and it looked quite good. Decided to subscribe for this app with annual subscription. After a few hours, I get a notice requiring me to subscribe. Thinking that my earlier subscription did not go through, I subscribed again, then only to note that I was charged twice for the same app. Please cancel only my 2nd subscription and refund that payment. Thanks.",1
"still would be a lot better if you had notifications that forces the user to snooze or dismiss. also I think it's a bad idea to have a ""Done"" button in an edit window of the task. you already have a place to result mark the task as done. this done button in the edit window is actually so much a pain coz that's the place anybody would expect an ""ok"" or ""save"" button to save the edit.",1
"A great app. The reminders are intuitive. The app has enhanced my productivity greatly. It's a bit pricey, though, for premium use (especially to add new users/workspaces). A workspace costs same price as a fresh premium subscription, making it not cost-friendly for teammates. Other than that, it's a great planner, to-do list and reminder app.",1
Great app. A couple suggestions to make it 5 stars. Would be good if the search actually found the item soi could drag it around as needed. Also ability to turn off alarm/reminder by default. Also Android app sometimes throws my task I'm trying to move around right down to the bottom and takes minutes to go find it then drag it back to the top,1
"I absolutely love this app, I run my own property maintenance business and it's just what I need to remind me about appointments and ordering supplies etc. The integration with WhatsApp is an excellent idea - I haven't missed a reminder yet. My only criticism is that it doesn't have a decent month view on the calendar, so I end up gravitating back to Google calendar, if that could be sorted out would be 5 stars from me.",1
"Good app, a couple of little improvements would be great. Tech support has been really good, very prompt and detailed instructions that worked!",1
"Pros - Really good app in terms of productivity and usability. - Love how it's possible to colour code and label tasks eg personal, work, university etc. - Love that it syncs with my Google calendar. - Plus I love the app's UI. - I also like the focus option; Cons - I think the focus option should be more like the forest app and not allow you to go away from the screen/tree, otherwise the tree dies. - I also think you should be able to add attachments to events like you can with Tasks.",1
"Please give option to make all tasks as default list, each time i open it takes mw to a list then i have to go all",1
"It's a GREAT app. 4 Stars because I think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected. Like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks (shower, laundry, gym), and the second widget for tasks I update and add throughout the day (pick up milk, get haircut)! That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day. Samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect.",1
"Tried many 'to do list' apps and Any.do best fits my needs. Has been using the web browser and mobile app on a daily basis for several years. Good UI and flexibility that allows everyone to manage their lists in the way they wish. Great value for the money, but it's worth mentioning that I often come across bugs that ruin the experience and make it difficult to work smoothly with the app.",1
"Coming from ios where I have been using Tappsk for a long time. This is getting a bit to used to, needing to write the time and tag by words in to the task itself is weird but gonna be fine eventually. Also I find overwhelming to create lists separately. I am also missing the aesy habit tracker. BUT I like the simplicity, ability to connect to other apps, dark mode which should be by default everywhere but for some reason it's not, and that I got a year premium for free (:.",1
Only had a couple of days and generally good experience. Ties in nicely with Google Assistant though I cant get it to automatically set a time to remind on a task when created by voice. Slight niggle that when I do certain actions completing events the app jumps to mid july on the calendar; no clue why but it's pretty irritating Overall seems to be helpful for productivity,1
"Last time when i wrote a review, there was no option to set Notification sound in the Anydo app. Some devs from your team acknowledged my comment and now that option has been added inside the app. Now I'm able to set notification sound. BUT, the notification is not working. Don't know why. No matter what i try notification isn't working. With this bug, Anydo app is just an useless junk in my mobile. Please fix this. Thank you.",1
"Pretty good Todoist alternative but I faced some issues on the first day. Opened the notifications and sorted by date and it's crashed. Completed tasks overlaps with other ones or list names often. It is not an old app, therefore it should be more stable and robust.",1
it's a really good app but it doesn't play any notification sound to notify me about my tasks,1

"I've had this planner app for years. It just recently started bouncing back an entire year when I put new appts in. For example...I just put an appt in for May 11, 2024. After I saved it, the calendar jumped all the way back to May of 2023, and I had to manually scroll back to 2024. I know... first world problems, lol. But it would be nice if this could be corrected.",1

"The app is good, but it's not for me. I found it too overwhelming. I prefer a more simple and quick app for my reminders, like Microsoft Tasks or Google Keep. Also, many features are paid. That by itself is not bad, but a subscription is a bit too much for a reminder app, especially considering that many of these paid features are available for free in other apps, like the ones form Google and Microsoft. It should good for professional use, if you're willing to pay for a subscription.",1
"I love this application so much!!! Good job to the developers. However, I've been having some issues lately with the application. The application refuses to notify me of some tasks I planned to do. When trying to set the time for a reminder, the clock's 5 minutes faster and automatically blocks the other minutes before. As an alternative, I set the date and time using natural language but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Kindly fix this. Once again, it's a wonderful application.",1
All it needs is Google Calendar integration. Edit: Oh wait it does have it! I was using the Any.do Chrome Extension (the little pop out thing) when writing this review. The Any.do Chrome Extension does not have the ability to display Google Calendar events alongside one's Any.do tasks whereas the Any.do Android app does indeed have it. AFAIK. It doesn't have IFTTT applets but I'd return if it made some.,1
"I used to love this (five stars) before you changed it. I was able to set repeatable tasks for each day of the week, but now if I set a repeating task today, for example, for every Wednesday, the reminder will come up today, not Wednesday. I want the reminder on the day I want. I am very disappointed. By the way, I won't use Any Do for my grocery list. I use a better one that keeps a running cost (including tax) for each store I go to.",1

Once a few more features are up to par (namely the website and the smart lists) I'll be changing this to a 5 star reveiw and paying for pro.",1
"I really appreciate many of the features in this app, especially the ability to sync with Alexa task (or grocery) lists and see the list easily via the widget! One feature that I've not been able to find (and would love) is a dark mode setting for the quick-add notification. This would be a great feature to add (or make it default if the app is in dark mode). Thank you for all the great work on this app! Very pleased!",1
Very helpful. I bought premium its not a subscription which I love. Problems: 1. The widget lists everything you need to do today and in the futuren in a long list with no divide. I see that and panic. 2. Being able to select multiple lists to display but not all. I don't need my shopping list showing on the widget 24/7. But I would like my appointments and daily chores displayed without having to change between lists (because I wont) 3. Being able to color code lists would be awesome.,1
"Coordinates Humans üôåüèæ This app was my go-to until covid hit. Keeping my personal, consulting business, and day work calendars in one app was madness. I broke off my day work to microsoft .to do on a separate device. Any.do now coordinates my consulting and my personal and family tasks, lists, and bills. Its refreshing. I do have syncing issues for calendar events as well as a crash everytime I add people to invites when creating an event. Thats why I gave it 4-stars. Love it for tasks.",1
"Honestly, awesome app... or at least used to be. Lately, it is extremely laggy, which is honestly a pain in the ass when trying to check which tasks u have to do. Also, it seems like there is a new feature where every time you back out of a task, it asks you if you want to save or discard; previously, it just auto-saved, which was very neat. On top of that, whenever I try to add a tag to my task, it doesn't save. It either takes me multiple tries to save the tag, or it just never saves. Plz fix.",1
"This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore.",1
"I wanted to b a more organized person so this app was editors choice, and I subscribed to Any-do for the year. I'm just not sure what the difference is between this app and a glorified notebook. I mean I'm still getting to understand, ex: Any-do moments I have no idea whats going on there (any advice). Also it claims to sync to all Google apps but I've seen things I put on NOTE that have yet to sync. Any way maybe I'm wrong and will keep practicing, overall it's a good organizer",1
"App is very simple which is what I wanted. Can sync to Google now. Can put as widget on home screen. Tasks are same color but seperated by date and will say ""this week"" etc. with list below. Wish I could put a date ending; for example I put a reminder ""spring break 3/1 to 3/5"" but can only put a start date and anything else has to go on note. Notification only show on task bar and never chime for the time selected. I keep using bc simplicity tho to have view of what all I have to do for month.",1

I do wish we could sort by list AND time instead of either-or. and it's not quite to the point that wunderlist was. but the voice control is incredibly handy, and it's decent at both shopping & to-do lists (although grocery lists feel a bit weird/limited compared to to-do lists). and the paid version is not necessary for most basic functions, although I personally upgraded because I felt it was worth it.",1
"I LOVE this app. It was the one I narrowed down to after having downloaded several to-do apps. HOWEVER, I wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember, without it being attached to a to-do item. I also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage, there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user. (An easier way to undo checking off a list item, being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks)",1
"better one of the hundreds of apps I've tried in this category I would definitely say top 10!! it's definitely a different look and approach to the ""to do"" or ""List"" apps that are usually out there! you could say it's more of a simple or easier way of looking at everything that you need to accomplish as it uses the today tomorrow and some day layout but it can also be useful for details as it has the options for subtasks if you so choose! keeping it for a while for sure over a bunch of others",1
"I like the ease of creating different to do lists, ability to create subtasks, and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store I shop at. It's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you. However, i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item, that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category. I also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it. Nice work üëç",1
"Overall good and useful. I'll likely continue to use, and.. .. . ..I would like more control of reminder sounds including repeating (so i don't miss it) and sounds without needing to open app. (maybe there are settings i can adjust). also more integration with other apps including Trello and Evernote and more a general multi app share feature would be great. As is i am copying and reentering things in multiple apps, and i want to just send them.",1
The app looks great but it's limited. You cannot add notes for specific days. You cannot add a calander unless you connect it to your email calander and the stake white color scheme can't be changed unless you buy premium. Which is about 18$ a year. I would love to see a daily note option with text editing allowed and the ability to add a calander without having to sync it with your Google calendar.,1
"Honestly, needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for (I tried out the free trial). The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)? Then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching. Other than that, it's a nice productivity app. Love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar",1
"This app has been my sidekick ever since it was released around 8 years ago!! The grocery list feature they recently developed really makes shopping a breeze. My only complaint, and the reason for only 4/5 stars, is that the long-press always vibrates when reorganizing tasks, even when my ringer is off. Really annoying when youre in a super quiet place, not just for me but for others as well. Otherwise, absolutely my favorite app on my phone!",1
Would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. The calendar widget is a complete failure. It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. The whole reason I subscribed to this app was because I needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.,1
"I have used Any.do for quite a while, especially for shopping lists on my phone. After a recent update, I cannot find a way to add to any list I have. That was my original review after an update. The help center was great and after only 2 emails and a screenshot, I was able to add to my lists again. The update made the feature to add items to my lists have a different look but it all works well now that I know the new look.",1
"The app looks great visually, and I really think the devs put a lot of time into it. But I'm not sure how it offers any real benefit over Google Calendar, considering the features are largely the same. Plus, this app still isn't available for the Samsung Galaxy Watch3. Truthfully, I would still be willing to pay $2.99 a month just to support the devs (the app really does look great), but there's no option to pay monthly, just one yearly price. If there was a monthly option, I'd likely subscribe.",1
"A great app for keeping things straight! This is the only app I've ever paid for the premium, and it's worth it. It's great even without premium, but it makes remembering daily repetitive tasks much easier. I have trouble remembering things like that, or knowing if I've already done it. Only thing keeping me from putting 5 stars is that completed tasks have to be manually deleted after theyre marked complete, and reminders will randomly stop showing up. Maybe the update will fix the second one!",1
"I've used this app to manage personal and work tasks for over four years with no trouble. Over the last few weeks, I've noticed that tasks which I've modified (by adding or removing words) are randomly defaulting to what was there previously. This morning I saw a task blink away and return as the previous version of the task (missing the words I'd added). I rely on my tasks being accurate and have never had this happen until recently. Any hope of a fix?",1
"Confused. I'm not sure what happened and I'm glad I didn't have a long grocery list because I just had to transfer everything from my ""Grocery List"" to a new one so it would open like a normal list and not as a pop up. I don't understand why y'all thought that was a good idea but whatever. I've clicked everything I can think to click. ""Convert to regular list"" isn't an option that I've seen anywhere. Is that only in premium?",1
"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.",1
"Long time user of this app, problem is it doesn't have a search feature. Or if it does I can't find it. Sometimes I forget where I filed my note or task (again longtime user) and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading I put it under, but if it had a search feature I could quickly find it and get back to being productive. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement.",1
"It's a pretty good app, but there are a few issues. It doesn't sort tasks that occur on the same day by which task has it's reminder set for earlier in the day. Instead when I select sort by time, it orders tasks that occur the same day in a seemingly random order. For example, a 12PM task will be at the top but a 10AM task is at the bottom. Additionally, if there is a way to delete color tags, I have not found it. At some point a couple of my tags duplicated and now I can't delete the extras.",1
"Clean, simple interface. Generally fast and easy to add things as I think of them. However.....I wish the app didn't think it was so smart. I find the auto-spelling annoying. Putting in 8-10 ft. electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as August 10th. And the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying. 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories. Changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage (and why do they show up under Tasks at all?)",1
"I've had this planner app for years. It just recently started bouncing back an entire year when I put new appts in. For example...I just put an appt in for May 11, 2024. After I saved it, the calendar jumped all the way back to May of 2023, and I had to manually scroll back to 2024. I know... first world problems, lol. But it would be nice if this could be corrected.",1
"Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added.",1
"Pretty good app! I've been looking for something where I can make events and ""check it off."" I couldn't find anything else besides this one. The sync feature with Google calendar works great but it reverts back to April 28th and you have to scroll to preset day for whatever reason. Aside form the bugs it's actually just the app I was looking for!",1
"Really nice todo list app,  love the web interface and notification features. Also the plan my day is a brilliant feature.  However for the more advanced users this software is lacking in features and overviews. Also found some weird behaviour when setting up recurring tasks.   For any novice users, you have a great app here. If you're looking for something on steroids, look at todoist.",1
1) It has a calendar feature but you can't customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google (can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry). 2) edit: figured the task sorting part out. Sort by time and collapse upcoming/tomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks. I like that. But it's still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as Google's since that is free.,1
"Clean, straight forward, and easy to use for me so it makes it more effective and likely that I'll continue using it. No distractions and helps me plan my day I really like being able to access it on both phones and computer too. Would like the sync updates between phone and desktop to be better / faster, hopefully that will improve soon. Would also like some additional functionality but that comes under premium.",1
"Really good app that has helped me get much more organised! Just one change to make it perfect. When deleting an event from the calendar, pleeease add an option to ""delete this and future events"". At the moment there are only options to delete one or delete all. Sometimes I need to delete client appointments from then on, but need the others in the previous weeks for invoicing, etc. Would make my life much easier üòÖ",1
"It's fast, easy to use, and I like how my repeated daily tasks only show up one day at a time and only shows up in the next day after I've completed the task the day prior. The moments feature makes daily planning a breeze, too. In terms of areas for improvement, I would like to see the Gmail zap integration fixed because it isn't working on my side. Also, for an auto-sort feature in my task lists so I don't have to keep refreshing it when I adjust the reminder times. Thanks. :)",1
"So far, so good! I've been eyeing this app for quite a long time and I'm pretty satisfied so far! I'd just suggest two features: being able to see completed tasks on the calendar, without them showing up all the time unless you clear all of them! And I'd love to see more features with the tags, like being able to sort tasks by them and putting different ""levels"" on them. For instance, this tag has more priority than the others. Thanks for the hard work!",1
"I love this app for keeping track of my homework, but I wish they would add some kind of timetable functionality for students. Also I think it's a bit poor that you have to pay for a subscription if you want to use the focus mode. In general the app is great, though, ideal for keeping track of everything I need to do, and it's great that I can set recurring reminders for orchestra, clubs etc.",1
"I love this app and I am so glad that I have found it. I wish I had found it sooner, then I wouldn't have wasted my money on other apps! The only things I would like improved is: - preview of the tasks in the tags and my list view. - the box view for the tags to be colour coded. Instead of the text, the whole box is in the chosen colour. - Quicker synchronisation with windows Keep up the great work!",1
"I really love this app. I find myself wanting to make tasks for myself about it. It has an incredibly clean UI and feels great to use. The only issue I have with it is the pricing model for the pro version. For 5 or 6- admittedly useful- features, there's a monthly subscription. Which personally I find to be ludicrous. I'd willingly pay a one time charge, but a monthly payment is just silly for this app.",1
"It's a great app, but there are a couple small issues I think are essential to be improved. 1. If I accidentally click off of a task as I'm creating one (which is easily done when trying to scroll along to set a custom time for the reminder), it will go away and I have to re-create the whole task again. 2. When I snooze a task that's on repeat (I.E Portuguese word of the day), it resets the task and stops repeating it also.",1
"1 week in. not bad. somewhat intuituve. I like this app so far for its thoughtful blend of simplicity and intuitive features that go beyond being a task list, & more into routine habits. some important features are hard to find or change after initial set up. my day planning activity 'anydo.moment': I could not find all week to modify... So, it was starting this important step at a difficult time of day to use. Many simmilar apps aim & claim to be useful but only achieve novelty.",1
"I LOVED this app because it has a calendar and to-do list in one go. I can categorize my tasks and put subtasks below. But when I recently updated the app, no radio button to tick off for the subtasks. I handle a lot of tasks categorized. Plus the notes below the subtasks is not there anymore. You need to add more clicks. It was easy and organized. Now, in uninstalling. So sad, i thought I have found the app. Was about to go Premium to get the full benefits but uninstalling. üò¢",1
"Very good app, simple and easy intuitive organization. The available free vs paid things are also very well balanced. The only thing I would change is giving it the ability to put tasks at a scheduled time. The task itself, not the notification, which is how it currently works. It makes it so you HAVE to have a notification if you want the task in the right place in the calendar.",1
"Very nice. One thing lacking in this and all similar apps I've noticed: lack of customizeability. The semi-transparent widget is cool, maybe my favourite so far. But surely it's not such a stretch to allow custom colours and an opacity slider? Otherwise seems fine, apart from the ridiculous premium fee for features that exist on preinstalled apps. My web hosting is cheaper than this, come on guys.",1
"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues",1
This is a great app which I use daily. It could be improved if able to export completed tasks with the task completion date.,1
"Suggestions: - Make the tag colors the background of the task, and not just a small line under the task title. At least have this as an option. - The trees in the Focus mode are all the same no matter how quick or long you do a task. Add variety to this mode: trees/plants to choose from, other decorations, probably even animals or different landscapes. Add more music to choose from, too. I definitely love the look and feel of this app. I enjoy it better with Premium, though.",1
"Lovin the app, I wish it has an ""expert mode"" so there would be more settings and options to organize my schedule",1
"preferred original home screen more. I don't need anything with a lot of bells and whistles. Great tool, though. Use it every day",1
"So far I think I like it. I wish there was a little more explanation of settings, and perhaps an easy way to set a task to a particular day without adding a reminder. Otherwise, I like that I can view my Google calendar in the same app as my tasks, and I love the way the task lists and grocery lists work.",1
"A Great app.  Nice interface.  However, it's missing the ability to sync other tasks/todo list such as Google's, Microsoft Outlook, etc.  The company shows good support but is missing an official user-to-user support forum... a method for users to assist in helping each other.",1
"I love this app! It has helped me become so much more productive and organized. Any time I think, ""I should do ..."" I just add it to my Any.do! [Would rate 5 stars, except I hate that the Upcoming list is automatically bumped up to Today after a period of time, and it also continuously logs me, which is not only cumbersome, but renders the widget useless for that time.]",1
"I used to love this app, my wife and I both had subscriptions to premium. Through no direct fault of it's own though, I have to quit it because Google no longer supports third party lists in assistant and that is one of the biggest uses I had for premium. Without premium it doesn't do enough for us. Thanks for the generally good app, I hope folks who aren't tremendously tied into the Google ecosystem can keep you going strong!",1
"Love this app because it does exactly what I need it to do (I use it for lists).. however, lately if, for example I need to pick up 2 cases of water and I put a 2, it immediately wants to change the date of the ""task"", and moves it on me. That's a little frustrating but otherwise the app is great.",1
"Beautiful app. Used premium for a while, but I just could not get over subtasks not being visible. Having to click into a separate screen to view subtasks is way too annoying. Also difficult to use with the Eisenhower method. Make subtasks visible in the list, and I might come back from Nirvana HQ.",1
"Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice.",1
"I had this app quite a while back and wrote to Anydo that it was imperative for them to make it re-orderable... Meaning if it is re-orderable, you can simply move the tasks easily up and down in their order. When I discovered Google Keep... It had that component, so I started using it and I have been happy with it.. But I took a look at Anydo again, and was amazed that aspect had not changed. Anydo is a good app, and I would give it five stars if not for that glaring problem",1
"Real nice app. I like links to google calendar for events, reminders. Not sure about tasks. Have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events? It'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks. Right now I use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar. I'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up (shows time blocks as busy in Calendar). Thanks",1
"I like the concept, but it doesn't work with how I use to do lists. I use them as a running list of things I need to get done within a general span of time. Something about putting a specific date for things to be done makes me procrastinate until the ""due date"" I've set, even if I give myself reasonable time to do it. I like the draw over that pops up when I use my phone for the first time in a day, but the due dates add an urgency that I use a calendar for. I know any.do is both, but still.",1
"I've used Any.do for years, both paid and free. I love how you can prioritize tasks, and the daily review of tasks easily helps keep you on track. The calendar that shows events and tasks is great. Highly recommended! My only comment would be that I wish it was a bit more customizable in the free version. üòÄ",1
"I absolutely love the Any.do app. I have a terrible memory, and this app is great with helping to remember all the things I have to do in a day. I also love that I can snooze tasks, and that it will remind me to make phone calls as needed. The only thing I dislike about it is that you have to pay for premium in order to set reminders based on location rather than time. Like I said, though, great app.",1
"Love the app, but when I transferred it to a new phone, it prompted for a login, and I can't remember my password. Went to do a password reset, but my wifi security won't let me access the page from the link Any.do sent for the password reset. This is the first time that my wifi security has EVER rejected a link to a password change. That's really NOT cool. I refuse to override and risk my internet safety, so my lists are all lost. Get rid of the hacking/invasive code in the password reset link!",1
It has everything you can think of. Easy to use. Has widgets for home screen. Clean and smooth UI. Love it! The only bad thing about it is you have to pay for full app experience (that's why 4 stars),1
good app sofar so good,1
It has everything you can think of. Easy to use. Has widgets for home screen. Clean and smooth UI. Love it! The only bad thing about it is you have to pay for full app experience (that's why 4 stars),1
Really good app. Helps alot with planning.,1
"Awesome app. I use this more than any other app. I've used it for years. I am a very task oriented person and me being able to create a separate list for my family members, work, etc. And setting alarms on when tasks need to be done is invaluable. Reduces stress in having to remember what I have to do and allows me to have more productive & happy days. Try it and you'll be glad you did.",1
"I've tried several different list/to do apps and none are quite as versatile as Any.do. I love that I can integrate it with my Alexa and add things to my shopping list. I also love that I can share and collaborate lists with my husband. The only sightly buggy thing I've encountered is trying to move a new list, made at the bottom of my numerous lists, to the top. It'll often get stuck and pre-order however it likes. If I go back and try a second or third time, I can get it to move",1
i love any.do ive gotten 4 other people at least using it everyday! so convenient and easy to make lists add to different lists and i like the opportunity to share lists with my husband and we can check things off and they show up on both ends. i love the daily reminders that keep us from slacking off! amazing app! way better than the reminder app that comes with my samsung phone!,1
"by far the BEST note app I have ever used the user interface is aesthetically pleasing and easy to grasp, the quick add to ur list button is reliable and unobtrusive, it allows you to integrate with calender and any other note taking app you may have been using before, u can separate the tasks and it automatically....nevermind just try it. it's fantastic! and that's just the free version. I haven't even tried the free trial yet. cool.",1
"It's not just a callendar! It's an excellent electronic version of a planner! In the callendar section, type events for every day of the week or month! Type in the location of the event and it will synch with your GPS! In the task section make separate list such a grocery list or regular list of items or tasks you need! Pretty cool and usefully for success in school, work, and personal life!",1
This app is amazing. This is such a well put together app I had to get a subscription to support the developers. A couple suggestions: 1. Can we connect the calendar to Facebook events? 2. More themes and backgrounds 3. Continue to improve reminder/notification options and displays. I am a big person that loves to be reminded because I often times forget to do things,1
"I absolutely love this app. I like having to do lists for myself but my calendar would often be over cluttered, or I would forget something I needed to do. I love the snooze option where it asks how long you want to snooze the reminder and ypu can set to an exact time and day easily. The unpaid option for this app is perfect for me.",1
"After trying several different task app's, I came across Any.do for a few years ago. Since then I've have had no reason to switch. This app is easy, intuitive and customizable to fit my needs. From a development and maintenance POV, I have also found Any.do to be thoughtful in their updates for both mobile and desktop versions.",1
"I need to use it more honestly, reluctant to purchase pro version of the app due to there being no set price. I would pay a one time fee for this to be my main planner. I use it on my phoen and on my laptop to plan ahead keep my days structured, grocery lists that i can send out to others, great overall app 10/10.. But I dont want to be on any more subscription services other than Netflix, Hulu, and Audible.",1
"new user, so far so great! just started using and am on the premium trial period. already I think it will be worth the annual fee! I'm in love with the sorted grocery list that i can print or share with my husband. i also appreciate the ""plan your day"" that allows me to select which items in my to do list i want to accomplish today and which i want to postpone. integrating with my calendar is also very useful so that i can see my appointments, events, and to do list all in one place! AWESOME",1
"Honestly, I struggle with most reminder apps because they make too easy to get rid of notifications. This app forces me to choose between checking something as done, snoozing the reminder for a duration of my choice, or a ""focus"" mode that goes into that tree planting focus app thing. I like that it forces me to make an active decision about whether I'm going to put something off or not.",1
"I've only had this app for a short period of time and it's already made a HUGE difference in my day to day life. No more paper lists to obsess over, lose, or struggle to read because of my sloppy handwriting! I have a super hard time staying on track and getting things done, so this app is super helpful. It's user-friendly, it has a ton of helpful reminders and task/listing options, and it connects to my Google Assistant to do (and sync!) everything. Highly recommend!!",1
"By far the best planning app out! I just have one issue. I happily outdid the premium yearly fee, but upgraded my phone the following month. When I uninstalled and installed on my new phone, it recognized me, email, even old tasks, but did not transfer plan. Can someone please help me with this. Thank you. Keep up the good work!",1
"Love this app! This is the only app that lets me move items around on my lists, like moving unavailable grocery items to the bottom. I also like that my completed items stay with me if I want, like my packing list, so after a trip I can make all items active again for the next trip without having to think of everything again. And the completed items on the grocery list jog my memory for the next shopping trip. I just use the basic app and am very happy with it.",1
"Started using this a long time ago, recently redownloaded after going through a period of not using any productivity apps and, returning to this app I love what they've done with it. The integrations to the calendar, the sub-task feature, the various categorization options, and the customizable any.do moment are all very useful and exactly what I was wanting from this type of an app. Basically it's good at what is does, and they update! It also had my old tasks, which was a good little chuckle.",1
"I've tried nearly every other ""to do"" app available, and none of them compare to Any.do: even the paid ones. The feature that holds Any.do above the rest, in my opinion, is the unfailable reminder system. This app literally hijacks your screen to remind you to plan out your day or to complete a task. I'm sure not all would find this a necessity, but personally, a simple alarm just won't do. I benefit greatly from the forceful nature of this app. It's pretty amazing, actually. Good job!",1
"Stopped working with Google Assistant. No notice of why. Literally my entire reason for using this app. I'm done. EDIT - My review was unfair. Their response here was measured, professional and appreciated. While I'm disappointed that I can no longer set Any.do tasks from my Google home ecosystem, this is Google's fault for discontinuing compatibility, not Any.do's. The fact that I'm so frustrated to lose Any.do integration speaks to the seamless, intuitive interface of their excellent app.",1
"great app! unfortunately does not allow for notes about (or long descriptions of) sub-tasks, but everything else: tasks, topics, google calendar integration, etc. it's got everything to serve my needs in a very clean and visible UI. thank you for such an amazing app, definitely considering going pro once it becomes more integrated into my routine and I decide I need the extra features.",1
"Amazing and very simple to use which is good for anyone with a busy schedule. Easy to Quickly put all plans for that day or as far ahead as you want. Jot down any reminder at anytime during the day in a few seconds or change anything already put in. Easy to share with anyone else if wanted. Easy to set up with any other calendar or app so it automatically saves in your to-do list. And quick, easy tips to help you with anything you need to know about the app. Love it!üíûüíØüíû",1
"I love this app. It has so much functionality. Moreso than I even know! I really like that it is a hybrid task/to-do list with a working calendar so you can have your daily tasks but also put your appointments and meetings on the calendar in advance. So many others seem to be one or the other. Plus it prompts you each day with a ""Plan Your Day"" sequence which is a nice reminder what is needed that day. I wish adding new stuff was included in the prompt, but i can let that slide. Thanks creators!",1
"I never write reviews or endorse products, but this one, I have to hand it to any.do -great job. It's always seemed like a no-brainer to me that some one build a planner, calendar, and to do list all in one with the added features of being able to pin in attachments to tasks (and hopefully calendar events in the future....?) with a killer widget (hope to see the ""my lists"" section end up as a widget option someday too!), and sleek interface, I don't know if I've ever nerded out so hard on an app.",1
"Fantastic UI with near perfect integration with calendar. I would love the ability to make tasks with no due dates that do not show up in the ""someday section."" Things like my grocery list and books/movies to read I don't need a date for and don't want them in the way when I'm looking at date-specific tasks. Edit: thanks for the reply! Not sure if I am missing this somewhere, but I would love to see the ability to comment on tasks. Would really help with communication with my team. Thanks!",1
"I reinstalled this program and now it works great. I think there's a bug when importing from Google calendar. (I submitted logs). Update- I decided against using this, the calendar integration is not as good as I had hoped. I can use Google calendar with better functionality for my purposes. I don't need separate lists, what I need is the ability to easily color code calendar entries and to add reminders. YMMV.",1
"App is user friendly and does what is needed, and more, without being complicated. I've never had any issues with this app, and I've used it for several years via different Samsung phones. Being able to arrange items and list catagories is great. Being able to easily share a list is nice. I love that I can easily add and view notes on any chosen item. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with Any.do. The app backs up data, as well, so I've never lost existing info when changing phones.",1
"After trying literally every cal app on the app store this is the one. I've used Any.do a few times over the years but it was never quite right. This time they nailed it. It's a super simple UI but has everything you need without being annoying or overbearing. Very simple to use & figure out. 15 mins messing with it & I'm fully ready to go. I transferred all my biz meetings, personal sched. etc. In minutes. Definitely give it a try, even if you have before. It's totally worth it.",1
"Love this app. I like to utilize lists to keep myself organized as well as to feel the small accomplishments. (Even on days when you can't get through everything it's nice to see the progress you're making) I use it for groceries, to do lists, tasks that will help reach a short/longterm goal, work to do lists, and more. It's great that you can have more than one list, set reminders, attach a file, add notes or a tag with priority. It's the best app I've found.",1
"As someone who really does a bad job making to do lists, this app really makes making them a breeze. Traditionally I don't make lists, or planners, etc because of the overhead in doing so; I'd rather spend that time doing the things I know I need to do. For a while now I've tried to find an app that would change that, that would make planning a breeze. After trying SEVERAL planning/TODO apps, this one quickly rose to the top. The interface is clean and simple and adding tasks takes no time at all - literally seconds. And above all, the Any Do moments make re-organanizing those tasks VERY simple and constantly keeps you on top of everything but in a non-intrusive way. Keep up the great work!",1
"Anydo keeps priorities in front of you, allows you to continually add, prioritize, delegate, move, and adjust tasks, thoughts, reminders, events, etc. in whatever way makes sense to you. It's motivating to check tasks off as you go through the day. It can be as precise or as relaxed as you set it to be. It works best for me by giving me a place to capture and instantly prioritize and plan things as they pop up. I love that it keeps me accountable and motivated without forcing a rigid schedule.",1
Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,1
"Its great, doing the job it need to. But i wish the homescreen widget is more simpler. I feel there is a lot of text, boxes. I wish it can replace the texts calendar, tasks, add task to some simple icons. Like putting a ""+"" sign for add task text on the widget and then giving the mic icon on the input field instead having it prior. Also, showing the tasks just for that day and removing the tomorrow, upcoming, someday things in the widget. Just my opinion, to have the widget simple.",1
"This app is really cool. one feature I would really appreciate is if you could allow events to be completed, or allow tasks to have durations/end times. A common problem I have is a task has a specific time and duration, but sometimes I don't get around to it at the exact time so I would like it to only be completed when I actually manually mark it off.",1
"This app is awesome! I'm using the bare bones version (not the premium) and signed in on all my devices, laptop, tablet and phone. I make/update my lists on the PC at home, I then reach into my pocket at the pharmacy, supermarket or while running errands and don't arrive back home kicking myself because I forgot something and now have to waste precious time and energy on another trip. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1
VERY EASY TO USE!!!! I have ADD and this app has greatly assisted me in keeping on task and completing task! There is no greater feeling than looking at all the task I have completed throughout the day. It motivates me to keep going and decreases distractions. I have added it to my daughter's phone who shares my disorder. The groccery list is awesome also. I love how it breaks items into categories.,1
"Eye candy to do list without bells and whistles. Workflow based on reminders, as for me, I wish to have a ""my day"" feature as in Microsoft to do. Best of all I love sync - it really takes seconds to syncronise 'done' tasks even with aliases. Also planning a day is a great feature, but it would be brilliant if it cover some tasks with no due date, or tasks that have been aded for a long time ago and not executed. And after all pricing is the most democratic among same apps.",1
"Good tracker. My only suggestion will be to be able to sync the completed task in a list and keep a note. currently, the completed task vanish from the list",1
good and nice with reminder. I reinstall because no other software provide this much in free subscription,1
Great app simple and straightforward everything I need it to do.,1
This app is the one I've been looking for. The user interface is incredibly smooth and intuitive. The app packs alot of useful content into one effective system! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!,1
Very useful to do list app. You can organize your all day theme here. You can create boards for start a project with teammates. And more üåüüåü Please add a priority sort feature in the app. This might be helpful for me.,1
Great for ADHD management. I'm a licensed therapist and I recommend this to my clients with ADHD.,1
"App is good. Does what I need. Tasks and lists. I can add custom tags and colours which I use for urgencies. Support is excellent, very quick and helpful. 2 suggestions, add a month view to the calendar as 1 week is too short sometimes and also the coloured tag dot is too small, make it a short line or something.",1
This application has become my lifeline. It's an excellent and simple todo app. It has increased my productivity to multifold. Thanks Any.do Team.. : ) Great,1
I love it. It's very easy to use and navigate. It's motivating me to do my tasks and organize it with my own will.,1
"Hi. I love any.do to do list and Cal app from any.do but recently after I transferred all my data over to my new cell phone, I couldnt find the Cal app and also couldnt find it in Google PlayStore to d/load it. May I know is there a way for me to d/load the Cal app?",1
Finally a cross-platform alternative to Apple's closed source reminders app that's compatible regardless of operatingSystem not to mention it's among the apps I most likely won't delete just because,1
Love the app for everyday and repeating reminders. Couldn't live without it now after 2 years. Nothing gets forgotten anymore.,1
I want to upgrade to premium subscription but I find no monthly billing...only yearly amount is debited initially itself..why? I would prefer monthly billing for 960.00 INR.,1
"Simply put, it makes my life easier. I haven't paid for the premium version yet, and unlike other apps where the basic version is garbage so you have to pay for premium, this app provides tons of benefits for free. I've tried A LOT of different notes apps to find the right one is this is by far the best one you can get. The premium version offers even more benefits and I will most likely upgrade soon.",1
love this app because I like how it reminds me about the schedule I need to follow all the time even when I have small tasks I like the complete but can't because I don't have time to do everything so I add it on my list and try to accomplish it right away üëçü§†,1
"Love the app, one of the most useful apps I have. Had an issue with moments before but it is intuitive and still has the same functionality. Looking forward to testing out the family features as I feel that's the only thing that was missing.",1
I have actually been using this app for what feels like years now. Through different iterations of their app and different iterations of my work flow. Idk why I like it so much and I'm probably not using it at 100% percent of the total application but I really appreciate it. Genuinely this app has been a powertool in my personal small business. I would love the premium version thank you!,1
"Had it for a few years now and it's great! I love how you can create lists for different things, cross items off but they don't completely go away just incase you get ahead of yourself and wish to bring that crossed off item back you can and so much more. ADHD friendly. Plain and simple look for those wanting something not so colorful Too much colors can be a distraction for some ADHD folk like me so this helps a bunch! Thank you!",1
This app feels very intuitive to use and I love how the user flows are all well connected. I like that every next task that makes sense logically sort of shows up at the end of every completed user flow within the app. It's a smooth user experience. I just downloaded it so I still need to test it out more.,1
Great Ap to organize your day. The free version is good but I upgraded to the paid version. Worth the couple bucks a month to stay organized. I always put reminders on my calendar and have a handwritten planner that I use for really busy weeks. This ap is great though it keeps all those reminders out of your google calendar so you can see your appointments at a glance but then it adds your calendar to your reminders on this ap. My favorite thing about this ap is it has a Plan your day feature.,1
"My FAVORITE task app...and I have the free version! Both the mobile and desktop versions are clean and sync flawlessly. Also love the separations of ""Today,"" ""Tomorrow,"" ""Upcoming,"" and ""Someday."" It's so easy to get lost with planners and lists that require too much detail. This system let's you type in the thesis statement of your task and rearrange it as your day or week goes. I won't be needing any other task app (Alexa, Google, ect.) again.",1
"Loved wunderlist and was disappointed when I heard it was being sundown. This app kind of grew on me and now I like it. I just need something that easily let's me group and name my different lists and this easily does that. Widget and interface are great. Hate the post it note style apps. Brower version is great. Would be better if it worked with Google assistant, but that's probably not Microsoft's fault.",1
"I've used multiple productivity apps that are supposed with a focus on to do lists. And this one is simply THE BEST for me. I actually feel like clicking the app and planning out my entire day. I love how simple it is with not too much overwhelming features which was a big thing for me. I would gladly choose this app, any day and any time over any others.",1
"This app has redefined how I live my life. It has made me much more organized, and I get so much more done! I use it to remind me of daily activities, work projects, house projects, ""do sometime"" projects, phone calls, bills...everything! I love that you can snooze an activity or easily change the time when it pops up. Also love that you can color code different types of activities. Most used app on my phone!",1
"I love using any.do for organizing all my tasks! I use it as a master task list. While I don't use it as a daily to do, it's a good organizer and reference of all my tasks. This helps me plan tasks as far as 6-12 months. The ability to make lists and tag tasks helps me to run searches and find things easier. Thank you!",1
"This app is usually pretty solid. Today, it won't let me get into it anymore. It keeps stopping. must have something to do with the update from yesterday. Rebooting the phone didn't fix it. Luckily, looks like i can still use the app via the widget, just can't get into the app proper. Support was able to fix this problem by deleting the data and uninstalling & reinstalling. i was nervous about losing everything, but all of my tasks came back and the app is back to it's stellar self.",1
"Love this app! Comes with a widget function so I can access and plan my day right from the homepage, not to mention you can customise the widget to fit with the style of your homescreen. Favourite feature is that the widget displays all the dates in a month along with any given day's tasks right below at the same time, so I dont have to switch back & forth. It syncs with Google Calendar events for a seamless experience. Its free version is powerful and already satisfies most my planning needs.",1
"Love it! After the last 1 1/2 months of trying both Any.do and Microsoft To Do, I have finally settled on my Wunderlist replacement. Any.do is the winner by a landslide. I love the clean look, the ease of use, and the interface with my calendar. But once the search feature was added, that secured Any.do as the clear choice.",1
"Five stars. Able to organize and tag quickly. Love the 'Plan Your Day' feature. I ended up going back to old school and using physical index cards instead of any apps, since that works better with my mind, but this was the best app I had found of many tried. Fair pricing as well. Excellent for separating out personal and shopping and grocery lists as well.",1
"After last update, there is a glitch. If there are multiple reminders open, above other app or on home screen, snoozing one will close all of them. And then you have manually trace all others which closed without snoozing or any other action. Before update, it was working fine.",1
"I have found this to be an amazing experience for helping me stay on track! I have adult adhd üëÄü§£ ..I tried to use other planning apps, and they weren't for me. I have to say, ""Any.do has forever changed my life with timeliness, schedules, and events! I have read a lot of reviews, and I did my own research. This app can/could be your dally assistant to put you on the path for being more organized and getting back to being stress free! What do you have to lose? It's free! Best Regards",1
it's a really nice app,1
it is a wonderful app,1
"Good, but recently the app has started opening in a random task list rather than All Tasks as it used to. This is annoying.",1
Excellent application for proper management of daily routine,1
"The app itself is nice, however it is missing import features for Google Tasks and Microsoft to do. They claim to offer Wear OS support, but Samsung Smart Watches aren't supported ‚ÅâÔ∏è",1
too much videos,1
good,1
good üëç,1
Ok,1
Just trying it out seem. easy to use. Will give it 5 star rating after working with more...,1
good,1
I Have using this app for a while it's pretty good.,1
"I will give you 3 stars for now, cus I just started using it. but its simple and reliable. no disturbance with ads, I was happy when the subs goes easily",1
it keeps you reminded of the tasks that you set out to do,1
it's a very good task organizer with connectivity to other apps that's new and fun,1
"Great task tracker and organiser. Helps arrange day, and track completion. 9Would be even better if there was calendar integration.",1
Music Feedback,1
For my phone,1
Does it have widget type reminders for lock screen like TickTick?,1
Nice,1
"I have just started to use Any.do, works really well with me so far. However, I would appreciate it, if there is a possibility, where I can check the completion of tasks. To be able to mark completed task once done and to show unfinished ones. If the option is already there, please guide me to be able to do it.",1
It was helpful and as a student who wants to keep tabs on my learning progress it works.,1
all ways going good üëç,1
"Good app, a couple of little improvements would be great. Tech support has been really good, very prompt and detailed instructions that worked!",1
This is a great app which I use daily. It could be improved if able to export completed tasks with the task completion date.,1
"I Started using the app at the beginning of the year, and the experience has been amazing so far.",1
üëç,1
Good,1
Awesome app and I recommend this app for people who likes being organized through out the day.,1
its work fully,1
What's up with the ap creating a grocery list? Products that I not only don't use but stuff I've never heard of. Went through support a while back and they told me to clear the cache. It's still keeps creating this list.,1
"Excellent app, really helpful in organizing thoughts. I would like to see Shared Grocery lists. Latest update doesn't have smart grocery lists enabled.",1
The app is great overall. The push for premium is a bit annoying.,1
Pretty good. My only issue that would prevent me from replacing my current notes app is the lack of long press (3D) to do a New Task/Item. Please add. Thank you!,1
Great graphics,1
best,1
not too bad,1
"I love this app and have been using it for many years. I rely on it. Lately, Repeat reminders keep failing regularly. You'll find them in your list as if it popped up to remind you, but hasn't. Basically some will remind and some won't, you have to reset them. Hopefully it'll be resolved, it's a great app to have.",1
simple,1
I love this app and want to purchase premium but they don't offer monthly plans only yearly plan available that's why i had to download another to do list app.Please provide monthly plans too,1
good my first try,1
"I like your design, it's very human and nice to see. But 2 bad points that stopped me using this app - I can't share task lists, only boards. And your widget with agenda is terrible. It doesn't have due date on entries and also I can't choose what to show - board, list, everything.",1
Really helped,1
Good One,1
I like..,1
nice,1
Would it be possible to make this kalender encrypted? Or is this impossible for Any.do?,1
the app is great now please give the desktop site the same features.,1
Gives the beat functions,1
"aplikasi yang bagus terutama fitur integrasi aplikasi dan workspace, tapi ada beberapa hal yang menurut saya akan lebih baik dalam penggunaannya. pertama saya hanya bisa membuat 1 notifikasi untuk 1 tugas dan kedua, kalendarnya tidak dapat membuat ""range time event"" serta tidak dapat membuat pengulangan event pada hari yang spesifik saja, ini mungkin dapat dilakukan melalui aplikasi lain namun akan lebih mudah untuk dapat membuatnya dalam 1 aplikasi.",1
it's okaayishh,1
"Hi, It's great app with nice UI",1
"I used to love this app, my wife and I both had subscriptions to premium. Through no direct fault of it's own though, I have to quit it because Google no longer supports third party lists in assistant and that is one of the biggest uses I had for premium. Without premium it doesn't do enough for us. Thanks for the generally good app, I hope folks who aren't tremendously tied into the Google ecosystem can keep you going strong!",1
Good,1
Ur VG ft,1
Can this be set to privide for own use only?,1
pretty cool,1
This one is simple and easy to use. I do not use it to organize all work. I use Any.do to keep notice on work/activities with no specific time or deadline. These activities are often work I really want to do. but keep easily forgetting. Any.do helps me keep track of those activities and get them done. Thanks for the simple UI and focus. üôÇ,1
"Great app. I'm not giving 5 stars because my day list on mobile is too plain text and looks like list instead of a kinda card for each tasks, this is why I wasn't able to intuitively know that you could press and hold each one to move them. Also the press and hold is way too stressful for the drag to be activated - I try many times before successful moving items. I do not also know why on the Today list (in the Next 7 days page has all the list of my tasks, both the ones for today and others.",1
great app I just need to learn to use it more!,1
"Love the app, but when I transferred it to a new phone, it prompted for a login, and I can't remember my password. Went to do a password reset, but my wifi security won't let me access the page from the link Any.do sent for the password reset. This is the first time that my wifi security has EVER rejected a link to a password change. That's really NOT cool. I refuse to override and risk my internet safety, so my lists are all lost. Get rid of the hacking/invasive code in the password reset link!",1
Have use this app years.,1
Would love if there was a feature for example where you could draw and add stuff in the notes that you can be able to edit. But anything else is dead perfect with the app would recommend it to everyone,1
"Can you make a widget for ""my day"" please",1
decent and sleek,1
I just got the app and it seems good. One thing I would suggest is to delete text after someone clicks the suggested grocery item in grocery list. I dont want to delete the text again to be able to write another item,1
Great for daily scheduling. Lost a star for getting rid of automatic grocery shopping list store departments.,1
"i love todoist, its free and it works! i do think, though, that they should bring back the option to defalt a task to every weekday or every day",1
good,1
I need to see the subtasks on the widget. I need the widgets resizable past current defaults so I can get more than two of them on one screen. Edit - thanks for caring about user feedback!,1
"I loved the free version of this app. but when I upgraded to the premium feature it was not worth it especially the calendar, Google Calendar provides Better user experience in free version than in its premium. Still tick tick is the best to do list app out there for smartphone, I tried most of them in the Play Store",1
"I love this app. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the dates change on you randomly. Other than that, it's perfect.",1
"Currently I'm not using full features So, it's a Good Application for Reminder, Event's. I'm happy.",1
"Almost perfect. I just wish the ""estimated duration"" of a task could be set when creating it. For instance with the keyword ""for"" when followed my a number. Also, the ""~"" for quick addition to a project is to hard to reach on a mobile keyboard. I suggest giving us the option to change that. Other than that, TickTick has convinced this Todoist and Microsoft To Do veteran. :)",1
Stick to notifications feature is not working and pop up reminders is not working.,1
"Really solid and pretty app. It needs just one minor tweak, when we swipe up from the widgets it won't let me open the app drawer.. which other system/non-system widgets let me do.",1
"Argh! I love the look of the most recent update, but do you know how many times I have accidentally completed tasks that I intended to snooze? You can't just change the order of those buttons without warning!",1
"Previously 5 stars, but I'm downgrading due to the unnecessary swap of the complete and snooze buttons. I have muscle memory for hitting complete and keep hitting snooze by accident every since this swap happened for no reason.",1
"This app now has many issues with ordering items on a given list, where when I try to move or reposition items, they snap back to their original position and simply can't be moved. It is frustrating.",1
"The latest redesign has inexplicably flipped the snooze and complete buttons in the notifications. Why? I mean, one way isn't better than the other, but everyone that uses your app already has a muscle memory. I hate it.",1
"I really adored the app until recently, once I made the latest update ""December 2023"" bugs appeared everywhere. The app closes on itself, I can't modify previous tasks and some functions cause the app to stop working. I hope you fix these bugs, I have a Sony Xperia L3 2019 (android 8.1) so I wouldn't expect the problem to be on my side.",1
So many options that it can't be compare with any other to-do/planner app. If they add Tasker support then it'll be a 5/5 rating.,1
Really great app that helps me keep productive. Too bad you can only get the full version through Online subscription models. I would have immediately bought it otherwise.,1
"App is great and reliable, but an assistant integration would make it perfect.",1
"A high 4.8. Very customizable, efficient, and does the job. I feel like this app should focus on creating more modes like the Eisenhower Matrix",1
"My favorite productivity tool I tried at least 10 apps before. However, I really miss a few features that would make TickTick perfect in my opinion: - quick and reliable Google Calendar integration - WearOS notifications: I can't understand why is it not possible to get the same notifications on my watch as it works with all apps except for TickTick - showing the kanban section in today's view. I use kanban sections as task states so showing not only list name but also the section would be great",1
"I occasionally look for another app, but nothing comes close! I only wish the calendar subscriptions synced better, I have to occasionally disconnect and reconnect my Google calendars.",1
"Excellent app! My only gripe is that when I open a couple of my habits to check them off in the app, the font size of the caption for the habit is much larger than the habit title on the screen that appears upon opening the habit If that gets fixed, it'll be a 5 star app for me",1
"As an improvement, required ""task hiding until specific date"". This prevents distraction while focussing on nearest pending tasks",1
"Wonderful app But I got a recommendation Can u add the ""list view "" in calender from the android app into the web /windows/mac versions . Simply put I would want a view that is like the ""Next 7 days"" but shows more (if not all ) days. (In the web/windows version. If this is done I will shift to tick tick completely from Todoist **currently there ""upcoming "" in the web version supports my workflow.",1
"Very Good app, will be better if‚Äì 1. Various colour for text, may help to quick seperation of tasks. 2. Bright colour & bold font for List name instead of a faint colour and thin font which is not legible. 3. A task repeated every month, say 17th of each month. After review on this month's 17th, I need to postpone it on 20th, by making change to it, all tasks get changed as on 20th instead of 17th. Add facility to change for only one month. This is posible with Google calendar. Good day !",1
"Great app, but the RTL isn't supported that great and has so many bugs with RTL in widgets.",1
"Good, but lacks a way to add items with a voice assistant since Google broke third party support.",1
"Great app, has very reliable NLP processing which makes it very easy to add new tasks. The only two things I wish the developers would add: (1) Make tomorrow in reminder popup ""tomorrow start of day"", rather than ""tomorrow same time now"" (2) Tasker integration - can add tasks now using AutoInput hacks, but it's brittle and requires phone unlocked - would be great if there was an explicit way to add tasks automatically",1
"Please add widget for showing contents of single task/note (only subtasks are visible, no description can be shown). Currently widgets are for the list of tasks/notes only)",1
I use a security software on my phone because of work. Its called MTD. They have just declared ticktick unsafe so I can't have it on my phone. Loved the software. But it's really annoying that security app doesn't approve ticktick,1
"Now after the upgradation, the app is much better than before, even though occasionally it fails to remind through notification sound. But l must say that this is a very useful app as it reminds us the important appointments, programmes and events which we tend to forget in our daily busy life.",1
"Really good app, very easy to use and hopefully it stays that way. Most apps end up doing too much and making it complicated but this seems to be consistent and works very well.",1
"Love this app! Adding and organizing tasks is simple, date and time can be specified with keywords like ""tomorrow"" instead of selecting a specific day and time on the calendar (that's possible too!). The only reason I gave 4 stars is because dragging/reordering tasks is still a little buggy. Specifically if you create tasks with sub tasks and then drag the parent task, the app crashes. I hope this gets fixed because reordering tasks is a big part of my productivity!",1
"Great app but... I can't view my Google Calendar tasks for free, it needs premium... Please allow us to use it freely... It's a vital feature for a ToDo list app!!",1
So far TickTick has been the best. How I love the Matrix thingy! No other productivity app has been creative enough to integrate that. The only downside is that the premium plan is way too expensive for younger students who would like to access it's full features for more productivity. I wish there was a way they could bring about a students plan just like Spotify so that younger people can also have access to it's amazing features. Again TickTick is the bestüëèüëç,1
"My Suggestion is that lists move to single page, not in to the menu. And If you add calendar such as Persian (shamsi) calendar they will be fine, But not in a alternate calendar.",1
"Good, but lacks a way to add items with a voice assistant since Google broke third party support.",1
It's user-friendly and the features are quite good. Overall it's worth installing the app,1
Stick to notifications feature is not working and pop up reminders is not working.,1
I use a security software on my phone because of work. Its called MTD. They have just declared ticktick unsafe so I can't have it on my phone. Loved the software. But it's really annoying that security app doesn't approve ticktick,1
Excellent,1
"It allows the user to organize the things, make to-do lists and short notes.",1
Amazing app. UI is even better in the tab. Much better than Google cal. Use the timer and Eisenhower Matrix alot. Great work by the team. App could be a bit more smoother though. Love it anyway. Premium user.,1
"It's portability over various OS (windows, Ubuntu, android, ... ) is for me the greatest tool of this app. However, For the PCs version especially the Ubuntu one, it'd be better if they could work offline at least before the next connection, to synchronise .",1
Please add local calendar of different countries.,1
My only concern is allow it to integrate with Google assistant.,1
Overall best task management app. But too many basic things reserved for premium which is not good. Features like adding photos and audio should be kept free.,1
Super good to use. Recommended,1
Simply the Best üé∂ Better Than All the Rest üé∂,1
Fine,1
"As an improvement, required ""task hiding until specific date"". This prevents distraction while focussing on nearest pending tasks",1
"Been with TickTick for a year, paying for 5 months I think. Mostly love it, but Google Calendar sync is a headache. Expected a smooth sync, but nope! Had to resort to IFTTT for tasks to show up in GCalendar on all my gadgets. Subscribed thinking it'd sync seamlessly, but it's a letdown. Why pay for a half-baked sync? Seriously considering paying IFTTT instead for a smoother experience. TickTick, step up your sync game before we bail for another app that actually set up sync correctly:(",1
Very Useful for me,1
Bagus semua fiturnya tapi ada kendala di sistem reminder-nya,1
Good but it's missing some features which is it in premium version,1
"Please add widget for showing contents of single task/note (only subtasks are visible, no description can be shown). Currently widgets are for the list of tasks/notes only)",1
best tool so far,1
I need hourly tasks too,1
"It is very good app but there are things you can improve: 1. In calendar view add layout of 2 columns to see week with events [task with duration] and tasks below. Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su - ----- Tasks here ----- 2. Better viability in calendar view including today day. + add Go to today button 3. When synchronised with Google calendar all those records you can't modify or add tags, subtask etc because all imported as notes/ events 4. To be able to see link with done task and new as result task",1
"Great app, esp the web app with One Big Flaw - the lack of a time tracker. They have a very no frills pomodoro which absolutely doesn't cut it for freelancers who need to track billable hours. I've found multiple requests online for this feature dating back 3 years with radio silence on it from the Ticktick devs...",1
"Great app, but the RTL isn't supported that great and has so many bugs with RTL in widgets.",1
It does what I need from it..,1
It's good for systematic habits do it,1
Is there option to disable or auto delete completed task? It fills up my phone storage :(,1
"I face a problem in collaboration section I have just one person to collaborat with me, but when I Wana to add second person , a warning appears which says you have already add 29 person in collaboration part. While I have just add one person. So this feature is totally useless üòí",1
"Feedback 04/23: PLEASE add more AMOLED themes to widgets! I really hate having orange highlights. My entire home page is really purple themed, so it just looks bizarre! Really great todo app even just on the free tier! Manages to misunderstand both Eisenhower Matrices (just na√Øvely groups by importance, not considering urgency) and Kanban boards (can't group by progress status) though, so use another app if you're looking for either of those.",1
App is good. No doubt about it. But i expect few more enhancements: 1. Let us connect pomodoro to Spotify music or YouTube music or endel. The white noise has ticktick has is limited 2. Make the calendar view better. Allow sharing of calendar for others to book appointment (but they shouldn't be able to read my tasks on my calendar),1
"Currently I'm not using full features So, it's a Good Application for Reminder, Event's. I'm happy.",1
Please add one time purchase,1
"It is very lacking the ability to set the end time of the day. For example, so that the tasks for the new day appear only after 2 a.m., and the tasks of the previous day do not become ""overdue"" before that time",1
"It works okay but has a little quirks. Kanban doesn't work on fold devices, a lot of space is wasted. Sometimes calendars that I'm subscribed to don't think so I have to unsubscribe and subscribe again for the updates to show up. It is still one of the better task managers out there. For the price and the tools available all in one app with so many widgets it's quite rare and very welcoming to see. Support hot has always been very active and very reactive.",1
"I've been using TickTick for probably 4 years, and it's the best to-do list app out there. It's simple and straightforward, and I love that I can have it on all of my devices and computer, and keep one to do list wherever I go. I would love to give it 5 stars, but over the last few months it's been very glitchy with syncing between my various devices.",1
"So far (one week in with premium) I'm very pleased with the app and its functionality. I like having the calendar view that includes recurring tasks, extremely useful. Having habits included is also a plus. Just a couple of things I'm not sure about, but I'll have a read around the support and help pages before updating my review.",1
"I've been searching for a task tracking app which would work across the multiple devices and include variable repeats. TickTick is working very well for me. I especially like being able to enter & manage my tasks via my PC with a full size keyboard. I can do the miniature keyboards, but it can be tedious. Why not a ""5"" rating?...well in my ratings that requires above and beyond expectations...rarely happens.",1
"It's a great app and fits my needs as a busy college student perfectly. My one issue is all the shortcuts when typing out a task. If I put that I need to take notes on chapter 2.2 it tries to set a reminder for 2am, which I have to manually delete. I've triggered shortcuts accidentally before and had to just delete and reword the entry because I couldn't figure out what or where it was. I wish there was an option to turn shortcuts off.",1
"Best complete cross-platform mobile task manager, especially with the quick add widget and straightforward task sorting by groups and priority. Still not the most fully featured (Amazing Marvin many more features but also lacks features between platforms) or the most streamlined experience, as numbered items are recognized as dates too often and you are only able to add hard due dates for items instead of being able to assign soft deadlines before something absolutely needs to be finished.",1
"All of the functions are amazing and the app works perfectly. It did everything that it promises perfectly. I compared and tried 5 different similar apps to see which would work best for me and tick tick was the best choice. It had the most of the features on my wish/need list and the easiest use. That said, I need a few more features, so that is why 4 starts instead of 5 (no app out there has them). If tick tick adds and enhances there features then I'd go 5 stars. Excellent app.",1
"I am an old-fashioned pen & paper person, but with ADHD and starting grad school full-time, I needed something more. This has been a life-saver. I have everything in one place on all my devices. When a random thought pops in my head, I throw it in really quick and keep going instead of getting distracted or losing the piece of paper I jot it down on. Improvements that'd be nice: - adding 'habits' to my calendar, not just set a reminder - an event option with address that will open maps",1
"EDIT: Seems like there's some issue with my pixel 7 breaking after a charge, the app itself is well designed and I love the habit widget! Wish it worked better on my device. After first day of use I started getting a bug where I could not mark a task or habit complete & the app freezes up everytime I try. This bug alone makes the app unusable and I have no idea what's causing it. I wanted to like it, I'm a fan of the design & features, but if it doesn't get fixed I'm switching back to todoist",1
"Very good reminder app. Alarms are very persistent; I wish I could select individual sounds for each alarm though. I also wish I could edit a snooze after I set it. And I wish I could postpone an upcoming alarm for one instance without postponing all future alarms. Update (4/8/2021): Thank you for adding a location setting for both arriving and leaving a location. Super helpful. Now, if you could get your app to sync with Google Assistant so I can create task while I'm driving.",1
"Update: The app is very buggy! It crashes oftenly and this is something they must fix. It ruins the user's experience. This is the latest version for the oneplus 6t The Best To Do List This is the best to do list I have ever encountered so far, which I'm still sticking to it. It does not only have basic todo list features such as repeats and a calendar. It lets you choose themes, make tags and different list. You should definitely give it a try",1
"Almost perfect!!! This app is my every-day checklist, my cleaning task list, my grocery list, everything!!! The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the weird, passive-aggressive pop up I get whenever the app decides it's ""not being useful"" and offers to turn off reminders. I don't always finish my to do list every single day, so these weird ""so sorry to bother you!"" messages genuinely get on my nerves. I emailed the developer about three months ago to ask if I could turn it off, no response.",1
"Overall, BIG FAN. I haven't found anything as in depth and flexible. Love that I can update my lists from all my devices using the online version. Variety of views and widgets is helpful. Not that intuitive, and some useful features aren't available or require a convoluted process. Took some time to figure out how to make it work for me. Glad I decided to give it a chance for a few months despite clunkiness though because now I find it INCREDIBLY HELPFUL!!!",1
"I was so pleased with the new Habit tracker as well as using a true Dark Mode. However, I don't agree with the Premium policy as I prefer to make a bigger one-time payment (such as when I bought Final Cut Pro X with Apple) instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to Todoist. It's a damn shame as I liked TickTick so much I'm willing to pay for Premium. Unfortunately, the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker.",1
"I'm a ""to-do"" list kinda person, I rely pretty heavily on them because my memory is üëé I like that this syncs with my Google calendar. I also like the satisfying little sound when I check a little box to mark a task complete (what can I say? It's the simple things in life üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). I especially like that I can schedule tasks and reminders waaaaay the heck ahead of time. Would've given 5 stars, but honestly, I'd really like a little more text options (fonts, colors, etc).",1
"So far I've really liked Tick Tick. Simple and easy to create, schedule, and organize tasks. I really like how habits are integrated too. Please add some more features to habits. Let me put them in calendar view. I work mostly in the calendar view so it would be so amazing to have the habits there instead of having to create them as a task as well. It seems redundant. Please let me put habits in lists or tag them.",1
"Great app. I have used the GTD method of organizing for nearly 20 years on many apps (going back to the Palm Pilot days if you can imagine) and this app is one of the best I have ever seen for that. I like how it combines a calendar with an organizer and it meets a need other apps haven't provided. Only improvement I wish to see would be that it could be easier to make calendar entries into the app directly. I have to got through a lot of steps to do that. While the app integrates outside calendars nicely, I would like this to replace my regular calendar.",1
"This app is easily the best timeblocking app on the market. Does exactly what is suppose to. I have to drop a star because it has some annoying qwirks that feel clunky. For example, I'd like the option to add an item in the schedule that isn't a to-do for things like lunch, or breaks. The deserve to be timeblocked, but not a strict to-do. Also I never use due date as I timeblock. So duration is exclusively what I do. I'd love to be able to immediately jump to the timeblocking calendar view.",1
"This task app is the only decent option I've found for combining tasks and calendar events into one scrollable widget. Tasks can be set to repeat from the date completed, which is essential for things like haircuts and cleaning schedules. Unfortunately, neither the app nor the widget (which is especially important) has many customization options. One option I would like, in particular, is the ability to hide the widget's title bar. Obviously color and display options would be nice, too.",1
"I'd be lost without tick tick. It's easy to use with many powerful features. A lot of the stuff other apps force you to pay for Tick Tick offers in the free version. My only issues are that the add button hangs and can require several taps to work, collaboration isn't particularly straight forward, and making notes could be better. But for tasks and to do this is the best hands down.",1
"I've used all of the popular and some of the lesser known To Do List apps. This is by far my favorite. You don't have to have an account and has more options. But you should for back up purposes. The only problem I have is that when I miss a task, it says due 10 minutes ago when it's been 2 hours. My tasks do show up on time though. The times vary, but this issue started when I created an account.",1
"It's a really good todo app with extra features like the Eisenhower matrix and several customizable widgets. My small gripes are a relatively low limit on the number of lists you can have while on the free plan, and some UI inconsistencies (multiple ways to do the same thing that look different in different places). I think the yearly subscription is reasonably priced, and would unlock some features I'm interested in (smart lists), but I don't think it would be perfect for me. Still, very good!",1
"So far, TickTick has been great -- much more enjoyable than the previous task management app I had (Tasks). For starters, my notifications actually pop up and work more often than the other app. I also love the easy-to-use interface and the different layouts/calanders available (though some are premium). Just a better looking, more functional every day app for any task you can imagine! I have had some notifications not pop up for whatever reason. I'll be keeping an eye on that. Overall, like it!",1
Really like the app. Its great for keeping various tasks organized. I use it to track the status of many dozen simultaneous maintenance tasks at multiple locations. It's great for this and especially because lists can be shared amongst multiple users and tasks can be assigned. Rating lost a star because changing from monthly to annual subscription has been a nightmare and I'm afraid I may lose all my data.,1
"Absolutely amazing. A simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want, and see on your phone, computer, or Android Wear. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient. Often, I would make changes to my tasklist on my phone, and they would not show up on computer until I went back into the app and manually refreshed it.",1
Works well to track regular and time-based tasks from your phone or the web. The free version has a generous set of features that rivals some paid services. Automatic syncing isn't always as fast as I'd like (between the web and the Android app) but that's a minor complaint. There is a bug with the current version that converts a weekday recurring task created from the phone app to a weekly task on the web. I've reported it and hope they'll release a fix soon.,1
"Great and useful reminder app! Only thing missing I feel, when it comes to the widget, is the ability to have it automatically change from dark mode to white based on the time of day. All the rest of my homescreen widgets already do this, so it's kinda annoying to have to change the color every time to match with the rest of my widgets.",1
This application is extremely helpful for keeping me organized. It's interface is extremely intuitive to me and it's ability to repeat events is about as flexible as I have come across so far. I'm not so impressed with the support I've received when trying to figure out why my events would always email me. I would have been happier if someone seemed to care enough to try to understand the issue and work with me to resolve whatever was within the application domain. I have knocked one star off.,1
Extremely helpful/useful app. Has tons of great features and most of them aren't even locked behind a pay wall! Syncs fast across your devices and the ui is very clean and easy to navigate. However I do wish the suscribtion would be a tad cheaper. If I can pay 99c a month for a weather app that relies on real time updates it could cost this app 2 bucks.,1
"Pretty good app, could use more robust settings, particularly for widgets. A complete options menu with variety is very important for an app of this type as the more efficent the app is for individual use cases, the more productive it enables the user to be. Otherwise a very well executed concept. I especially appreciate gesture control, and the inbox for sorting.",1
"This app is super useful but I'd really like the tasks & calendar events to be better integrated, & fully visible from 3rd-party calendar apps. I want to be able to view my TT tasks on DigiCal & plan my schedule around my tasks & events. I'd at least like to be able to subscribe on DigiCal to a calendar of my dated TickTick tasks. I'd also like to be able to hide/complete calendar events from cal subscriptions (like check off irrelevant work events or holidays I don't celebrate). Great app tho!",1
"Update: I did eventually hear from customer service and ticktick is working well for me again. While ticktick was broken for me I went back to todoist and I still didn't like it enough to switch. So glad the problems I was having have been fixed. Old post: This has become useless on my phone and tablet (Android). Crashes 95% of the time I try to add a task. Same is true using the badge widget. ARG! No longer Very powerful, and NO LONGER FUN",1
"I love the ability to see my to-do items synced with my Google Cal. That way I can drag my tasks to whenever I want and plan my day out. The only reason I'm giving the app 4 stars is because recurring google calendar events show up multiple times (in the same day) on the calendar view. I contacted their customer support, they responded: Sorry there is no setting for that. But I will note it down as a feature request to our product team for future consideration. It's not a setting...it's a bug",1
"This is a GREAT ap. It is easy and intuitive to use. Only 4 stars because you can't trust it with repetitive tasks. It nearly always skips the next occurrence when you mark one occurrence complete. Doesn't matter what the frequency is. I have submitted feedback twice, Nov & Dec 2019, with no response.",1
This is one of the best reminder apps. The only slight annoyance is sometimes reminders don't trigger at the exact time but the app tells you why. The workaround is annoying as it takes up an alarm which can mess with do not disturb modes. Still this app is great and I've used it for many years without too many issues.,1
"I've used this for the past week with the free trial, and I think I'm in LOVE. I've tried many to do list apps in the past - Todoist, Google Task, Wunderlist, Microsoft To Do... but none has compared with TickTick! It has a simple, uncluttered layout; easy list making and calendar scheduling features; the ability to have notes in lists (!!), a habits tracker (!!!), and it even has a POMODORO timer! It can use improvements in terms of intuitive design, but other than that, it's perfect. ü•∫",1
Amazing app. UI is even better in the tab. Much better than Google cal. Use the timer and Eisenhower Matrix alot. Great work by the team. App could be a bit more smoother though. Love it anyway. Premium user.,1
"Been using TickTick for over a year now, overall very happy with all the features, look and UX. I've not had to use customer support or report any issues yet, so can't comment on that experience. It would be great if calendar could in future support dynamic sync to Microsoft Outlook (can add the calendar view but not add/edit events, as it does for Google Calendar).",1
I have had this App for over a Year now and it is 100x better than my previous To-do list app. There is just one feature I would really love to see that would secure me from ever switching from this app. That would be a habit tracker widget for windows. For some reason ticktick doesn't provide this feature on windows at the moment and only on android. However everything else about the app I love! Update: I've now purchased premium they still haven't added the windows widget habit tracker though,1
"It's portability over various OS (windows, Ubuntu, android, ... ) is for me the greatest tool of this app. However, For the PCs version especially the Ubuntu one, it'd be better if they could work offline at least before the next connection, to synchronise .",1
"Great app, esp the web app with One Big Flaw - the lack of a time tracker. They have a very no frills pomodoro which absolutely doesn't cut it for freelancers who need to track billable hours. I've found multiple requests online for this feature dating back 3 years with radio silence on it from the Ticktick devs...",1
"It is very good app but there are things you can improve: 1. In calendar view add layout of 2 columns to see week with events [task with duration] and tasks below. Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su - ----- Tasks here ----- 2. Better viability in calendar view including today day. + add Go to today button 3. When synchronised with Google calendar all those records you can't modify or add tags, subtask etc because all imported as notes/ events 4. To be able to see link with done task and new as result task",1
App is good. No doubt about it. But i expect few more enhancements: 1. Let us connect pomodoro to Spotify music or YouTube music or endel. The white noise has ticktick has is limited 2. Make the calendar view better. Allow sharing of calendar for others to book appointment (but they shouldn't be able to read my tasks on my calendar),1
"Feedback 04/23: PLEASE add more AMOLED themes to widgets! I really hate having orange highlights. My entire home page is really purple themed, so it just looks bizarre! Really great todo app even just on the free tier! Manages to misunderstand both Eisenhower Matrices (just na√Øvely groups by importance, not considering urgency) and Kanban boards (can't group by progress status) though, so use another app if you're looking for either of those.",1
Really good for To-do lists - I wanted something more in-depth so I switched to click up (it's a project management tool and I'm a bit intense about my lists) but this is great for very in-depth to-do lists! Definitely the best to-do app out there. I love that you can sync with your calendar and see everything in the app,1
"TickTick is very helpful. I like the various repetition options, especially being able to choose a set time span after completion rather than a rigid every month type schedule. The only downside we have found is that there is sometimes a syncing error between devices.",1
"Borderline life changing. Had a bit of a steep learning curve, but now that I've figured it out, my head finally feels clear. I'm so much more productive than I have been in months! The only thing I would change is to be able to collapse subtasks on the widget. I really hope you add that in soon üíïotherwise a perfect app!",1
"This app has done wonders for my productivity, and for me it's well worth paying for pro features to keep all the moving pieces of my job straight. While there is room for improvement with settings for recurring events, along with needing better ways to copy/generate lists, on the whole it's a great app that I recommend to colleagues regularly.",1
Overall best task management app. But too many basic things reserved for premium which is not good. Features like adding photos and audio should be kept free.,1
"Absolutely love this app.It's feature rich,easy to use,and has an appealing and customizable interface.I would give this app 5 stars but i would like to request one additional feature.The ability to schedule a task by just inputing the duration instead of having to choose an actual time.I want to schedule a task that would take about an hour but don't necessarily want to schedule a time for it. Just to be able to input duration 1 hr instead of putting 9am-10am would improve my user experience.",1
"I'm optimistically giving thid a 4/5. I prefer Todoist interface, but TickTick seems to have a few better features. I tried the Calendar integration and was disappointed. Sliding tasks down to the minute is annoying. Rhe fact that I cant create Calendar events to sync back to Google Calendar means that the caledar features are generally useless for me.",1
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns",1
"Great planner/ calendar app and habit tracker. Has greatly improved my productivity and helped with my forgetfulness. While the free version has no ads, the premium has some really nice features that I'd consider upgrading if it wasn't a subscription model. Would've been an easy 5 star, but subscriptions on phone apps suck.",1
"Really great app, fast and snappy like a to-do app should be like so you don't miss any thoughts, my biggest issue with this app is that there is no one time pay to buy option for it, while I find it useful I don't need a lot of the pro features, I am a basic user and need it just to track my personal tasks, as such the monthly payment subscription for the Pro version does not make sense to me, why not add a basic pro model, with limited features, that users can outright buy forever.",1
"This is the best reminder app out there, and the only one I use on my iphone. It'd be a full 5 stars, but there's no watch support for Android. It's a bummer, because when I switch daily drivers, I have to use other reminder apps. Even if you just threw a cheap one on there, it'd literally be perfect",1
I've used just about every todo app out there and TickTick still works the best for my relatively complex needs. One great bonus features is integrated Pomodoro system support. Kicking off pomos for specific tasks and being able to measure the number of pomos really helps me focus and measure my efficiency. The integrated short and long break prompts keep me from burning out. -1 star for the single entry bar and list sorting. RTM wins hands down on those fronts.,1
"Love it, just wish you could have more lists for free. I'd love to support the app but it's hard to justify yet another subscription for something other apps offer for free, like Microsoft to do. I'd definitely do a one time purchase to help support if I could get more lists and use just as a task list.",1
"Wishes: Yesterday's undone tasks would automatically move to today. Drag & drop tasks to a new day on calendar to reschedule. Tasks' checkbox matched the list's color to see which list they belong to from a glance. I restructured it to use the priority markings to indicate lists (ie: to do at work is all yellow, to do at home is blue, errands red) Priority tags are pointless, just arrange the list w. high priority items on top. Habits need ""No more than X"" tracking. ie ""No more than 2 naps/day""",1
"TickTick is a great and getting better. The developer seems to understand what people want. The Android app is responsive and easy to use. My only complaint is that the font in the day view for the calendar could be larger. If you compare TickTick's calendar to Google's calendar app, Google's fon't is larger and easier to read. Other than that, I highlly recommend TickTick.",1
"Four stars! Even subscribed to this app after comparing many similar ones! Love the Windows app that has Widgets for Calendar, Tasks, and Eisenhower Matrix that can be made transparent AND Dark Theme!!! Also, this app does allow you to see recurring tasks in the calendar (once you enable the setting, unlike other apps)!!!! This app also has a Chrome Extension, so it will show in my Chromebook as well even if not as kewl as the Transparent widgets in Windows. One thing I did notice though, is that Version 6 seems to be for Mac/iOS only (correct me if I'm wrong, but Windows version is 4.x.x.x?) so that's the star not provided... Why four stars? Cause the Windows version seems behind the Mac version according to their blog... but I am writing this review at 2am.... so I am tired, but also happy cause the educational discount... yay!",1
"I. Love. This. App. There are two reasons why I've gone for 4 instead of 5. Although they explicitly do not share info with 3rd parties and follows GDPR, the app reads your text messages. Why not make that an option that can be turned off folks? Second reason is that they don't have a way to integrate the app with Outlook calendar. They have G-cal which I'm sure is amazing. However it seems reasonable that there should be an integration coming in the future since Microsoft is big.",1
wish i could set different pomo time defaults (like different amount of times for each activity) instead of changing it each time i want to use it. app is kind of slow on startup. still better than any.do and todoist for my needs. update: paying for premium with google rewards credits. wish i could add/edit google calendar events within ticktick like you can for any.do,1
"I like the app a lot, with one exception - If I snooze a daily 5pm reminder today for :15 minutes it doesn't mean I want the reminder going off at 5:15 pm tomorrow, but that's what happens. Wish they fix this bug. 3/11/22 - I've noticed the snooze option from the notification shade no longer works on Android. It simply clears the notification.",1
"I downloaded this app and I didn't expect much but its honestly amazing! I love the simple layout and everything about it. I love that you can add or delete tools like for me, I wanted to have a habit tracker and I could simply enable that. I can clearly see why it is editors choice! Recommend it to everyone! ‚ù§ Edit: You can only do 5 habits with subscription sadly.",1
"I love everything about this app EXCEPT...I would love to have the ability to use custom music / chose from a list of ambient music (white noise can be annoying). Play external music can cause me to miss the notification when the pomo ends. Having the music stop/starts is very useful however, I prefer music to white noise.",1
the best app i have tested but some widgets disappeared affter run the app like timtable wiget befor run the app he apear and after run the app he disappear,1
"I keep coming back to this app and learning more and liking it more. The list mode was really overwhelming until I realized I could tag all my tasks and see them in my list by tag. OR in kanban mode separated by tag. Seeing your list based on tags took this app from falling short to a game changer. I think it's a bit funky that when collaborating on a list, scheduled tasks that are assigned to my spouse, that I'll still get notified.",1
"Little bit widget modernization needed, else all great",1
"This is absolutely the answer I have been looking for for over 15 years! It combines 5 different To-dos, task lists, calendar, timer and now just noticed a stopwatch focus tracker?? It keeps getting better and I've only had this a couple weeks! I love how I can be on my MacBook Pro, jot down things to remember, then function seamlessly on my Android Note 9, then when necessary pick up where I left off on my iPad! TickTick functions really intuitively and is versitle enough to customize! Luv!",1
"Wow, the features of the app are all on point. Habit tracking, Eisenhower Matrix, Pomodoro Timer etc. All in one app. If I stick with the app I'll be happy to delete my separate apps pomodoro and habit tracking apps because I wouldn't need them anymore. Very convenient. Also, the app is very intuitive and easy to navigate through. It loads fast and feels light despite packing a lot of features. 10/10 work keep going.",1
"The best app I have ever used. I was on Todoist but switched to this for a comprehensive calender view and was surprised to find I like it better in almost every way. Well worth the premium cost and has done an incredible amount in helping me handle time management, goal setting, habit tracking, and more. It is my single productivity app and it does it all. I have almost no criticisms of TickTick. Stylus support would be cool! If it could replace Onenote as well I would send them all my money",1
"OK, I've finally found something to replace my beloved CloudCal and CloudTasks, which seem to have been abandoned, as the dev is communicating NOTHING to customers. TickTick, has a similar not that steep learning curve, but, once you catch on, it is fast, flexible, efficient, and gorgeous (I run the Dark mode.), which is actively updated. My new ""go to"" task manager and calendar. Great job, devs!",1
"I have tried multiple kinds of planner apps and this is the best of them all. It is the only one I found that lets me make recurring to-dos, have everything in a calendar view and give each task a duration (paid features), track habits, have focus sessions, subtasks, reminders, get summaries about productivity, and sync with all my devices (MacBook, iPad, and android phone). The free version is good but I highly recommend the paid version. I am more motivated and productive because of this app.",1
"2023 Update: Still going strong with TickTick, it keeps getting better & adding small but appreciated features. It's so good that I am legitimately worried they will change it and start using ads or high price walls for the standard features. I do not exaggerate when I say that this app literally doubles my productivity. 2020 Review: After many years of Android, finally found the perfect task app. Plenty of category and reminder options, and seamless sync to the cloud with a web based interface.",1
"Great app! Terrific interface and widely available on all devices. The reminders, habit forming trackers and the Pomo timer really make this app all around perfect. Before this app, I'd never used or heard of the Pomo timer, but it actually works well for me to keep me focused on tasks and to refuse interruptions from co workers. Being able to use check boxes in the description is nice, but I would like to see sub-tasks and dependencies one day.",1
"I appreciate the experience that this app is providing. It is helping me to prioritize, celebrate successes of completion and attempts to keep me to deadlines.... I have become a list person more now than ever and need to see what to accomplish. One feature I love, you can scroll down the list right on your home screen. The list is always visible!",1
"I was looking for a basic task reminder app and have tried around 6 different task apps. Tick Tick seems to work the best with my android phone running Oreo 8.0. The other apps were either glitchy, made my phone glitchy or freeze up, ran down my battery or didn't have the features I was looking for. Neither this app nor the ads are very intrusive. It has good custom features and is fairly intuitive.",1
"I have been on the hunt for a great Task organization app for quite some time. Have tried several including Wonderlist, and all have fallen short of TickTick. Clean interface, multiple themes including a great dark mode. I only wish the premium mode was a one time App purchase rather than a subscription. Other than that, I highly recommend.",1
"I'm sold! I've tried so many task lists, habit trackers, calendars, pomodoro apps, pocket link storing and this is the ONE! It does all of it in a single app. It allows for sharing task lists. It has folders, tags, and smart lists. It has a my day interface to help start and end the day. It integrates with Google calendars. Has a gmail and chrome extension. I don't use it for notes, but you can and it allows for the same tagging, formatting, and folder features. I love this app!",1
"I was looking for a good app to replace Wunderlist, and I found it. Needed something with a home screen widget and desktop version for work, and a big selling point for me is that you can hide features you don't need or have. Tired of companies trying to shove premium features down my throat. This app is very simple-faced. Also love tiny features like turning your lists into a kanban view! Couldn't do that with Wunderlist! Also love the priority color categories to sort by!",1
"FINALLY a app that understands the difference between a task, habit, and a event. Love TickTick so far, using for a week or so, feels fluid and easy to use like Wunderlist was, but much better and free of the bugs. It looks like habits are not working on the web app version, but that is ok as I mainly use it on my phone. Great product! Will likely upgrade and be happy to pay for the premium version.",1
"I was really struggling to complete tasks daily due to focus issues, but this program helped me a lot. It's as intrusive as you want it to be and easy to prioritize tasks through the website and take it to go on my phone. I recommend going for the pro. It's with it too me.",1
Amazing. Great interface. This app can do anything you would need for simple or power users. It is great for a simple to do list personally and complex situations for work. The free version alone is very comprehensive. Slightly buggy but I have been using it for years and nothing major.,1
"Love this app! I abandoned AnyDo after they limited to me to no more than 500 total entries; even though I was paying for the premium service. Since there are no such limitations on tick tick, and the OS features are very similar if not better than AnyDo, I'm excited to have found a new organizational home üòÄ. The only feature that you don't seem to have is a way to easily determine if you've got accidental duplicate entries... perhaps this will be addressed in a future update?",1
"TickTick is such an incredible app! It's a fantastic tool for scheduling, organizing, and tracking habits. The user-friendly interface and extensive features, such as collaboration and synchronization across multiple devices, make it stand out. I'm amazed by the depth of its functionality. I highly recommend it!",1
Great except I can't use it. Notifications on my Galaxy Watch 4 stopped working. Tried everything I can think of to check and fix. I am a computer person and know Android settings pretty well. My other apps that notify work fine on my watch. Just not TickTick. UPDATE: Tech support hung in there with me and resolved my issue. Thanks!!!,1
"I've tried to use other apps including returning to native Google apps but the amount of features TickTick provides is way too good and I keep coming back. Scheduling, calendar integrations, tasks/lists and note management, pomo timers, habits. It does it all. Very well. Access on every device is also a plus.",1
Just when I think it can't get any better! I have used so many organizing apps and this one is head and shoulders above the rest. With other apps whenever they make an update you're groaning hoping nothing breaks and this app it's always an improvement you didn't even think about. I have made multiple suggestions and 90% of the time they are actually implemented within a few months. It literally has everything you need without being overwhelming.,1
"This app is PERFECT! I have been using this app for 3 days now(Free Version). The free version has more than you could ever need. I have been struggling to find a app that could do everything I'm looking for; such as : Cross-Platform between my Tablet, Chromebook, Computer(web & Microsoft), & phone, Tag System, Calendar, To Do list/Task, Reminders, Notes section, Subtask feature, Color Coding, Search feature for any word, Check List, Adding photo's, Links, Sharing. This APP has everything!",1
"Overall, I love this app. It's easy to use and has a lot of features that allow me to organize all my tasks. The previous issue has been fixed with the newest update. Speaking of that update, I love it! The app looks and feels smoother. I like that it's now a pop-up instead of just pulling up the entire task page automatically because it's quicker and takes up less space on the screen.",1
I'm really into productivity apps and have tried a bunch of them. But TickTick is the best. It's the easiest to keep track of your tasks without them getting lost some other place in the app. I can always see the tasks I inevitably postpone right at the top of my list and that means I don't miss anything crucial ever. I also appreciate how many snooze options are available with the notifications and I LOVE that I can customize the app! I've found The Holy Grail of Productivity Apps!,1
"This is the to-do list manager that I have been looking for for the past 10 years. I've used everything from the built-in ones on my phones and computers, to Trello, and most recently Todoist. TickTick is very feature-rich and has a bit of a learning curve, but the user interface is well laid out intuitive, and the help and tutorials told me everything I need to know to get started. Edit: I found a small bug, and reported it through the app. It was fixed in the next patch release. üôÇ",1
"Making lists that regenerate after they're complete has really helped my scattered ADHD brain get into some solid routines. TickTick has helped me remember things I would have forgotten and has given me timely reminders for when to do things. I like the app a lot, though it's a little easy to get lost in the UI / UX when you're deep into lists on your phone.",1
"TickTick is really great. Tags, list filters, views like the Eisenhower matrix make it very easy to view my tasks at different levels of granularity (e.g. all to-do's for the day, versus work to-do's, versus all urgent items). I'm neurodivergent and the view that works best for me changes with my focus level. It's really nice to be able to adjust for that within a single app.",1
"Best to-do / task tracking productivity app that I have found in during my 4-5 year quest to find the perfect ""to-do"" app - this is it! I have been using TickTick for well over a year now and have not found any other app of its type that is more robust, well-thought-out, and well-rounded in its features. BAD*SS widgets, Pomodoro, Eisenhower Matrix, Linking notes feature, collaboration capabilities all A+",1
"Love this app!! It's exactly what I've spent years looking for! Einstein matrix, various displays and organizational methods for lists and task, calendars (you can import from personal, work, etc). Plus the habit tracker with an Pondo timer!!! The widgets are so fun, it makes me want to use it, thus I'm utilizing my time better, so it really is working.",1
Absolutely the best to-do list app I have ever tried! I have used TickTick for several years now and it is my external brain. The customization option for each task to be set up to recur by due date vs completion date is my favorite feature. I recently switched from ios to android and found the app to work beautifully in both. Update: Three years later and I still LOVE this app!,1
"As a Wunderlist refugee, I love this app. I tried using Microsoft To Do but it feels too plain and doesn't have natural language, which is REALLY important to me. Other apps like Todoist don't provide important features in the free version, but TickTick provides all the necessities for free and has a few extras in the premium version, as it should be. I also can't stop using the Pomo timers. LOVE IT! Don't know if I'll ever go back to To Do, even after they add onto it!",1
"A lot like todoist except better in the smaller details: Can comment for free, add proper subtasks, the UI is easier to navigate for me and is more intuitive, and also I really like the little ding noise it makes when you check off a task. Honestly this could be the most cobbled-together, last-minute-cs-student-project there is but if it still made that little ding noise, I would love it just as much",1
"It is not an exaggeration to say that the colorful, customizable, syncable, endlessly-useful TickTick has changed my workflow, productivity, & life. There are some improvements I've hoped they'd make -- the ability to determine an est. amt of time for a task (aside from Pomodoro/calendar); including a habit tracker in the computer software in addition to the phone -- but it's 5 stars even with those elements lacking, and that's why I am a loyal customer who has recommended it to everyone I know.",1
"Best task/to-do app I've used. Simple to learn and use. Has very flexible snoozing of tasks. Can add description of task as a note and/or create a checklist within a task. A real plus is that it can be accessed through Google Assistant by voice to add a reminder/task rather than making a separate Google reminder. Because it works with Assistant, you can add tasks while driving using Android Auto.",1
"Awesome experience. Quickly became my favorite task management app. Would be nice if you could add appoints directly to subscribed calendars. But tasks are the most important thing. The notes experience could be a little better. But markdown gives me just enough to be as descriptive as I need. Being able to sync with Google, Dropbox, Onedrive would be nice. Sharing tasks/team management should be on the roadmap.",1
"Nothing better. Not sure how many years I have used this, 5+ years @least, I have tried everything out there, but nothing works as well. First, it's easy. Second, it's minimal, I don't spend more time setting up, organizing, etc. I spend my time doing what I need, not taking time in the app Third, it's every where I need to access it. Is just easy and fast and I particularly love the reminder feature. I used it free for awhile, but have happily had premium for years.",1
"By far the best to-do app out there. Here's why: 1) intuitive way of creating tasks, reminders and check lists 2) reminders that allow you to instantly process the task: dismiss it, postpone it etc. 3) now, premium is where it's at! With premium you get a pomodoro timer that is automatically integrated into your tasks. 4) habit tracker with analysis of progress, this is also with premium. Basically this app does it all!!!",1
"I love, really love, this app. I think it's worth mentioning that I'm extremely picky about how I organize everything that is digital- if it's not all in one place and intuitive, it's not worth my time. This app is excellent because it combines tasks, reminders, calendars, tags, and priorities. It's easy and beautiful, and it has so many wonderful premium features. I particularly like the smart lists, themes, and functionality of the app AND the web version! They're both great. However, if you're picky like me and need color coding to be a part of your calendar, then this app isn't for you. It has everything else I need except that! Without color coding my calendar, my burdensome amount of events becomes difficult to distinguish at a glance. Anyway, I love the app, it's great, definitely worth paying for premium if you don't need a color coded calendar. If you do, and you're not super picky, maybe only use this app for to-dos? Since I am and need everything in one spot, it's back to Google Calendar for me. P.S. Developers- great work, thank you so much, please let me know if you add color coding!! I know it seems small but it makes a big difference to me since my calendar can get so crowded.",1
"Usually I don't post reviews, but TickTick is an excellent app that allows you to customize your to-do list in a variety of ways. Need to look at a picture for reference? Attach it to your task. Need to attach a description or side-notes to your task? It's very simple to do. It may be overwhelming at first, and the subscription may turn users away, but it becomes exponentially easier as you use the app, and the subscription is definitely worth the investment.",1
"This is the absolute best mobile planning tool. And I've tried all the others, Any.do, Todoist....you name it. Tick Tick is so easy to use. You can brain dump tasks, and schedule them. It has the very best scheduling system, and it's super easy to move them around it. It has flexibility, aesthetic, and loads of different tools. It has focus timers, habits, personalized lists, cool themes, and ability to prioritize tasks.",1
"This is a very good app for keeping track of my busy day. I've actually replaced Google Calendar because TickTick can do so much more. The subscription is reasonable, especially considering what is included. If you purchase the subscription, uninstall and reinstall the app. Otherwise, it appears you will lose sync functionality across devices.",1
"Finally found what I've been searching for all along. Wanted an app that was essentially a planner, without wasting the money and time on an extra paper planner. This app is intuitive in its application- allowing you to get everything out that's in your mental to-do list and then letting you form a plan and assign dates to tasks. Or you can do it the other way around, it's up to you!",1
"I use this for all my to-do lists, shopping lists, and all kinds of other lists and notes. I originally started using it when GTasks went out of support because it has a similar UI. A few things like list sections are not that easy to use but mostly it's quite intuitive, syncs across all my devices, and has all the scheduling, alerts, and priority setting that I need.",1
"TickTick provides my ideal structure (highest level is a list, then a task, then the option to have checkboxes for tasks). It allows you to share a list so that every task made within a list is shared as well - no need to share every newly created item. Reminders can be persistent, perfect for someone like me who would otherwise swipe away the reminder before completing the task. Text/date parsing makes it easy to set dates and times. Customer service is always quick to reply.",1
"Simple and intuitive. I don't even know for sure how long I've been using TickTick, but at the time I tried multiple free to-do list apps, and this one was by far my favorite. It allows my tasks to auto reset on a schedule of my choice. I get reminders for the day, but can also set reminders ahead of time (down to a specific time of day if preferred).",1
"I live with ADHD and have always struggled with prioritization and scheduling. I have tried so many other apps for calendars, to do lists, reminders, pomodoro timers, and habit tracking. TickTick blows everything out of the water, with a beautiful interface and the perfect amount of customization. The more I use it the more features I find that I love. This app has transformed my ability to manage time effectively and build better habits.",1
"This app has saved my butt on many occasions. The way that it integrates across platforms and allows you to snooze and set customized reminders is perfect. I've used it for about 5 years and there have been a few bumps where permissions on Android kept it from notifying me but this was due to updates with Android and it was corrected quickly. The interface for putting in dates and times is a little tricky but once you get the hang off it, it just works and is very functional. I couldn't find anything else that compared. I use it daily. Thanks to everyone on the TickTick team. This review is the least I could do for the saved time and reduced stress over the years. Not affiliated or payed or asked to give this review. It's just the truth. Highly recommend!",1
"Just started using TickTick, after having tried several different kinds of reminder/tasks apps. So far, I have little to no complaints about my experience. Interface is great and user friendly, and every other day it seems like there's a new feature that I didn't know about, and actually come to love. Also having to live with ADHD, this app has more than helped me so far and couldn't recommend it enough",1
"I'm using the free version of TickTick, and for what I'm paying, it deserves five stars. I can make detailed to do lists with multiple actions under one subheading and can categorize my lists to make it easier to see what I'm doing (and what I could be doing if I find myself bored). You can schedule your tasks to repeat with a lot of custom settings. I appreciate the functionality of this app!",1
"Has every feature I could ask for in an app like this, and it's all executed perfectly. Leagues better than any of the other options. I do feel like $30 a year is steep for premium, though. For new users, know that premium is by no means necessary; It just gives you a little more capacity for random operations and unlocks some convenient functionality.",1
"It's the best replacement for Wunderlist I've found, though not as multifunctional - I wouldn't recommend it for teams or project management, but it's great for keeping up with daily individual tasks. You can set priority as well as time, place, date, etc. and it has repeat functions as well. Sadly, no nesting capabilities, but sub tasks can be listed in the notes. Minimal, clean interface and multiple platforms are the main reasons I use it.",1
"We just use this as a list management tool and ignore all the other features. It's perfect for shopping and Todo lists. My wife and I share an account so if one of us goes to the store the other can see the updated list and not risk duplication. Camping preparation lists, handyman lists, restaurants we want to try, etc., etc. We brought the premium version because we needed more lists. Great product.",1
"I've tried them all and nothing beats this app for calendar and task management. Every app has a learning curve but this one is intuitive and user-friendly. And once you learn some of the more subtle, yet powerful features (i.e., drag-and-drop rescheduling) you may become addicted to it. Imagine an app that can keep you on time and on task without being intrusive in your productivity. And the subscription price is ridiculously cheap. Wish list: user-defined auto-synch across platforms.",1
"I never leave reviews (I should- I just always forget). But this app saved my life. I have ADHD and couldn't stay on top of things no matter what I tried. Until I came across this app. As soon as something pops into my mind, no matter how small, I put it in the app. And it stays there until I move it or complete it. The combined functions of the calendar and the list view is perfect, and works together better than any other app. I recommend this to everyone who asks- thank you so much.",1
"THE BEST task management app I've ever used (and I've tried dozens). It's simple to use and has a nice user interface, but it's got the robust features under the hood and out of your way for when you need them, for example advanced recurring tasks, multiple notifications, habit tracking, calendar sync, location-based reminders, search, tagging, etc. I started with the free trial for a year or two. I've now been a happy premium user for over 4 years.",1
"Extremely powerful and customizable app. Great widgets. It takes some time to poke around all of the available settings, but you can set up a widget to do just about anything you can imagine. View your tasks and lists the way you want to. I like the sync between the mobile app and desktop browser experience. Also easy to back up, although I do wish there was an automatic backup/storage sync feature.",1
"Best product for personal and small projects organization!. I was actually looking for a simple todo list, then I needed to unify all my calendars from different platforms, but also I wanted to save and follow up my ideas while keeping a journal, then I found myself trying to incorporate some good habits in my life, on the other hand, I found out that the pomodoro technique can really help me focus and get things done. Finally I found an elegant solution for all of this and more in TickTick.",1
"Best I've found so far. Very easy to organize. I use it daily for all my bills, shopping and so forth. The widgets you can add to home screen look lovely and have all the info you want right there. For my bills, for example, you can set up an item to occur every month. So I'll input Verizon $75 on Jun 10. And after I check it off, it'll drop to bottom of list. Checking off other items will hence bring it back toward the top. But the reminder will always be for the day (Monday) or date (10th).",1
"Apps and features work great, I'm satisfied to finally find an app that can give regular reminders that one can snooze or adjust. Unfortunately, some of the most useful features are behind a subscription. This includes a full calendar view. If you're just looking for a checklist, this is a good choice. But if you pay, it has replaced my Google calendar (which was easily integrated!).",1
"Tried ALL of the other apps. None had the overall features of TickTick. Especially needed the calendar which many todo apps don't have. Was primarily using Google Calendar plus Toodledo. This combines most of the functions of each of those into one interface. Easy to learn. Great mobile app and great desktop web access. Great mobile and PC reminders. Easy to forward uncompleted tasks. Could use more color options, particularly to highlight specific calendar entries for categorization purposes.",1
"Premium version is the best calendar app I could find. I tried to avoid paying and spent a long time reading reviews, but for all apps something crucial was missing from free version. In this case, calendar integration with Google didn't sync properly, so I switched to the premium version so I can use ticktick as my only calendar.If you're trying to use free version, this is pretty annoying. It's cheap, though (slightly cheaper than the main competitor todoist), so I'm fine with paying.",1
"Have used every day for over a year. This app replaced the normal pocket todo list that I would write up every morning. It is far more efficient at remembering what I have to do than I will ever be. As the owner of a small furniture store this app has been a huge factor in the successes in business that I have experienced this year. I particularly love prioritizing tasks, scheduling repeating tasks, and easily moving tasks to future dates when plans change. Cheers.",1
"Great app! Great price, actually way underpriced for what you get. I was able to delete at least 2 other apps and use this as my go-to for everything. I am a ""planner"" and this gives you every way to plan you could want. Great design, user friendly, highly recommend. Bonus is the plan you day feature which you won't find on a lot of other apps. I tried several before coming across this one, & so glad I did! Also, the all device sync (including PC), & widgets are amazing!!",1
"Have been using for >3 years. Very dependable. Due to my own discipline, I have had periods where I used this daily and periods (months) where I didn't open the App. When I am using the App, I work better, I feel more in control, & I accomplish more of my priorities. Over a decade ago I used Outlook Tasks constantly. The only feature where TickTick does not meet the old Outlook task is that TickTick is designed to have a single date associated with a task (called a due date). I use the Due Date as a ""start date"". TickTick is less flexible in building special reports based on both start date and end date for a task. I think of tasks always as having a start and an end. When you use the ""duration"" in the paid for version, it is still complicated as TickTick does not provide easy ways to create custom reports and smartlists using StartDate and EndDate. Other than that, this is a fantastic app that allows you to create ""lists"" of tasks (I use as ""Projects""), have a 4 level priority system which I no, low, medium and high priority but I use as ""low-medium priority"" (no !), High Priority (!), TODAY (!!) and NOW (!!!). This way I can easily signal what one to three tasks I am working on Right Now when I get disrupted with another call it is easy to redirect myself. Great app. I gladly pay for it so they can continue to support the app and improve it - and I get the value out of the app. I have looked around for better todo list apps multiple times and never found anything better short of going fully back to Outlook to manage my emails and calendar which I do not plan to do.",1
"This is by far the best to-do list app I have ever used. It is very reliable and there are no bugs, has good smart lists, the tag system is very flexible, you can set multiple reminders for tasks, and you can also set reminders for recurring tasks. The cross-platform syncing is extremely seamless and there is an in-built pomo timer. (The pomo-timer interface could need a little updating.)",1
"This is the one. Easy and intuitive. Simple and not over engineered, yet functional. Group task by high med low and no priority. Set reminders on a calendar, etc. I've been using it daily for years and absolutely love it. I figured out why the pomo timer wasn't going off, Google reset permissions for notifications during focus mode and DND.",1
"So far, the redesign has been great. I think the added features are well implemented and the updated look is pleasing without being so dramatically different that it causes issues. I've been using the app off and on for a year or so. I'll stick with this app as long as it remains this consistent. Thanks to the developers! Update 2 months later: Still loving this app. I'm regularly pleasantly surprised at how flexible it is due to its wealth of carefully considered, unobtrusive features.",1
"For many years now I have been running an Android app called Checkmark ToDo. I loved it but the developers stopped updating it long ago and the latest version of Android (v14 - new phone) would not allow me to install it. I was lost. I had my life in there an no other app that I had ever looked at had ""Repeat by Completion Date"" until I found TickTick. It does almost everything that I had before, has a nice widget and syncs so I can see my tasks on my laptop. No complaints so far.",1
Good,1
I love this app But little one in is pre target üéØ features include than it was fantastic For example 500questions in 30 days Like this ...,1
"Good, the best app I found for creating and tracking habbits and to do lists",1
Good,1
It's helpful,1
"I occasionally look for another app, but nothing comes close! I only wish the calendar subscriptions synced better, I have to occasionally disconnect and reconnect my Google calendars.",1
Really great app that helps me keep productive. Too bad you can only get the full version through Online subscription models. I would have immediately bought it otherwise.,1
"I love this app, but I hate subscription. I'm not using it that much for paying $50 per year. Thank you guys.",1
Good,1
A little tricky to learn how to get a task to repeat correctly.,1
"Excellent app! My only gripe is that when I open a couple of my habits to check them off in the app, the font size of the caption for the habit is much larger than the habit title on the screen that appears upon opening the habit If that gets fixed, it'll be a 5 star app for me",1
Considering the application I never seen before and the I dea is great the best app in the play Store to manage yourself best theme method and etc many things you can use for free and there even is pomodera method or focus method to there best task management app for 2023-24,1
"good UI, options, etc. But it is too buggy regarding converting title text to time",1
"Reminders sticking to status bar doesn't work anymore. This was a useful feature, hope it gets fixed soon.",1
"I love it, but is it possible to have the option to make the bubbles on the tasks different colors from the other?",1
90 just because it need spelling checks,1
I have had this App for over a Year now and it is 100x better than my previous To-do list app. There is just one feature I would really love to see that would secure me from ever switching from this app. That would be a habit tracker widget for windows. For some reason ticktick doesn't provide this feature on windows at the moment and only on android. However everything else about the app I love! Update: I've now purchased premium they still haven't added the windows widget habit tracker though,1
It's an good app to remind you for your work but u have to follow otherwise it won't work better for u guise,1
I like it,1
Could we have an update where uncompleted tasks from the previous day automatically moves to the next please?,1
Great,1
"Now after the upgradation, the app is much better than before, even though occasionally it fails to remind through notification sound. But l must say that this is a very useful app as it reminds us the important appointments, programmes and events which we tend to forget in our daily busy life.",1
"I like it but being forced to leave a review... Really? Minus 1 star for that, but other than that good app overall",1
So many options that it can't be compare with any other to-do/planner app. If they add Tasker support then it'll be a 5/5 rating.,1
"A high 4.8. Very customizable, efficient, and does the job. I feel like this app should focus on creating more modes like the Eisenhower Matrix",1
"Great app, has very reliable NLP processing which makes it very easy to add new tasks. The only two things I wish the developers would add: (1) Make tomorrow in reminder popup ""tomorrow start of day"", rather than ""tomorrow same time now"" (2) Tasker integration - can add tasks now using AutoInput hacks, but it's brittle and requires phone unlocked - would be great if there was an explicit way to add tasks automatically",1
Notification alarm & completion alarm are not consistent.,1
"It is very lacking the ability to set the end time of the day. For example, so that the tasks for the new day appear only after 2 a.m., and the tasks of the previous day do not become ""overdue"" before that time",1
"App is great and reliable, but an assistant integration would make it perfect.",1
"Really good app, very easy to use and hopefully it stays that way. Most apps end up doing too much and making it complicated but this seems to be consistent and works very well.",1
Sometimes i feel i have too many options but 99% of my use this app is great.,1
"Pros: I like the design overall. Reminders work well. I think the black theme is great for reducing eye strain. Cons: The search feature is lacking - if I search a single word, it may return tasks with that word in the details before tasks with that word in the title (which I would expect to see first). Task in multiple tags don't always display as expected. Can't 'select all' or 'select all by tag' to batch postpone/schedule. Can't see total # of tasks in a day selected in calendar view.",1
"add ability to make a task notification time recognize the key word ""every hour""",1
"This app now has many issues with ordering items on a given list, where when I try to move or reposition items, they snap back to their original position and simply can't be moved. It is frustrating.",1
"Great App! I use both mobile and PC versions. They sync perfectly. Easy to use. Helps me be productive. Gives me peace of mind. I know my goals, visions, and daily tasks are organized. Allows me to see what matters most to me. I have action plans to execute. Feel fulfilled checking each to-do knowing the positive consequence and outcomes.",1
"Edit: several years on and TickTick is still going strong. Nothing compares for tracking objectives and todos. Original: Fantastic Todo app. It works to track everything important that is going on. I was a heavy Wunderlist user and prior to that, Astrid. This app is flexible enough to check all the boxes and works great across all my devices. Definitely a must have!",1
"This is one of the very best task listing apps (the silly name aside). It is easy to use and has enough features to make it useful and effective, even without paying for a subscription. But it doesn't overwhelm you with tons of extra features; the interface is uncluttered. If you want their advanced features, you can subscribe. But you can use nice features like folders and tags without a subscription.",1
I've looked for a task manager app for a long time and tried several. They were always missing a feature or two that would have made them perfect. This one is easily the best I've found and I have yet to find anything about it I'm unhappy with. Great capabilities with their free option and genuinely helpful features for the paid version. Would recommend to anyone.,1
"This app is brilliant...fascinating,but if you can make more things free ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",1
Please fix the lagging in the latest updateüò≠üò≠,1
Great app. Good integration. UI is a little wonky and takes a little time to become familiar.,1
"Great, but needs 2 hours snooze instead of tomorrow snooze",1
"I've used this for the past week with the free trial, and I think I'm in LOVE. I've tried many to do list apps in the past - Todoist, Google Task, Wunderlist, Microsoft To Do... but none has compared with TickTick! It has a simple, uncluttered layout; easy list making and calendar scheduling features; the ability to have notes in lists (!!), a habits tracker (!!!), and it even has a POMODORO timer! It can use improvements in terms of intuitive design, but other than that, it's perfect. ü•∫",1
"Great app , useful features",1
"I have tried many of the popular android task manager apps, and this is definitely the best one. The only issue I have seen is the ctrl/back-space is deleting the checklist items. It should only delete the previous word on the checklist item (like it functions on a note). UPDATE 12/6/23 This is fixed. Thanks!",1
Great app. Simple to learn and use.,1
Nice app,1
A very good app to have in your tool kit. Adding Arabic language for Muslims and Arab users would be a cool addition.,1
So far so good.,1
Good,1
Very useful,1
"Wonderful app But I got a recommendation Can u add the ""list view "" in calender from the android app into the web /windows/mac versions . Simply put I would want a view that is like the ""Next 7 days"" but shows more (if not all ) days. (In the web/windows version. If this is done I will shift to tick tick completely from Todoist **currently there ""upcoming "" in the web version supports my workflow.",1
Good,1

I wish there was a search feature.,1
"Been with TickTick for a year, paying for 5 months I think. Mostly love it, but Google Calendar sync is a headache. Expected a smooth sync, but nope! Had to resort to IFTTT for tasks to show up in GCalendar on all my gadgets. Subscribed thinking it'd sync seamlessly, but it's a letdown. Why pay for a half-baked sync? Seriously considering paying IFTTT instead for a smoother experience. TickTick, step up your sync game before we bail for another app that actually set up sync correctly:(",1
"The best to-do list for the way I work, but unfortunately the oled-black theme isn't very black.",1
This is one of the best reminder apps. The only slight annoyance is sometimes reminders don't trigger at the exact time but the app tells you why. The workaround is annoying as it takes up an alarm which can mess with do not disturb modes. Still this app is great and I've used it for many years without too many issues.,1
I personally use this app with other apps to study and I gotta say this was a rly gud support. My main to do plus study app is flip thoüòã,1
"Muy util, lo √∫nico que no entiendo es porque no funciona la integraci√≥n con google",1
This App Changed My Life.Alhamdulillah.,1
"I really adored the app until recently, once I made the latest update ""December 2023"" bugs appeared everywhere. The app closes on itself, I can't modify previous tasks and some functions cause the app to stop working. I hope you fix these bugs, I have a Sony Xperia L3 2019 (android 8.1) so I wouldn't expect the problem to be on my side.",1
"Hi, during scheduling for example say I want to do a task from 1:30pm to 3:30pm. The following is considered as invalid : ""Task 1 today 1:30pm to 3:30pm"". Whereas ""Task 1 today 1:30pm to 3:30am"" is considered as valid and actually reflects as 1:30pm to 3:30pm in the calendar. Please resolve this bug.",1
Good app,1
"Really useful although part of need subscription with money , also I wish they improve the synchronisation with other signed in devices and be able to add due date to items in task",1
"My new favorite to do app, and I've literally tried them all. With a spreadsheet of pros and cons. It's rich in features while not getting so complex that I feel overwhelmed by task management. It has a habits function that is separate (!) from task lists which is great for people who use process these things differently and don't want to see them together. You can also create habit categories including Morning Routine and Evening Routine. There's a built in pomodoro timer. Just try it.",1
"Almost there..! This app is the almost perfect solution for my job. I suggest for subtasks to have their own text formatting and check lists. Additionally, the summary page is cluttered: If I could turn off task descriptions within the summary, but still keep subtasks, I could better understand my weekly summaries. Lastly, I want to mark (sub)tasks as NOT COMPLETE if I know I didn't complete a task but I don't want it showing up as overdue. Summary formatting for this would remain the same.",1
"Definitely one of the better task manager todo apps in the Android space (with versions for iOS and windows as well). Many strong features make it very attractive esp. the paid version such as - unlimited tags, quick ball feature to quickly add a task, all kinds of dates/duration settings and reminders, natural language recognition etc etc - a long list of strong features. However a BIG minus continues to be very weak search features (no advanced search), and the app is often slow or sluggish",1
"This is by far the best tasking app out there. As someone who struggles with ADHD, this has been a lifesaver. It can sync with calendars, remind you of things based on location or time, and lots of other cool things. The interface is intuitive and tasks can be as simple or as detailed as needed. Additionally, it can work as a kanban board and be used among teams if needed. It works on and syncs across web, mobile, even my smart watch. Could not recommend more.",1
"Love this app! It's easy to use, and once you get used to it, it gets even easier. It's the first app I've ever actually stuck to, because of its goal setting. It gives ""Karma"" points for successfully marking things off, and makes me want to stick with it. I emailed the developers with a question just one time, and they were quick and helpful with their response. The Premium version is worth every penny!",1
"Love the minimalist nature of Todoist. It's exactly the right number of features. Inbox, projects, quick add tasks with keyword support - all great features that make the app quick and easy to use. Too many other to-do apps are overly complicated. This is by far the best one I've come across. (Free version, single user.)",1
"I love this app! I've tried a few other task list type applications, but this one really takes the cake! Their format is very flexible and has all the basics offered for free...except reminders. Data syncs well across devices, you can create subprojects, stacked task lists, and many other useful features! I check Todoist throughout my day and it's working well for me so far. If you need reminders, check out their premium version! It has plenty of features that are actually worth paying for. ;)",1
"Absolutely love this app because this is a digital version of how I've always organically done it. Can assign things to projects or labels. Have due dates and repeating events but also no dates if you want! Love how the website/desktop version is so similar to the app that navigating between the two is a breeze In terms of minor changes I'd like to be able to repeat but ""every other day"" or ""every monday, Tuesday, and Thursday"" for semi regular events/chores/tasks. Overall 10/10",1
"I recently moved from a job where I utilized Microsoft Outlook's tasks. I struggled to find an app that could perform as well as Outlook. This app does everything and more! On PC...I love the predictive typing, Google Chrome attachment, flagging emails, typing notes, attaching files, reminders, and more. And it syncs across all my devices. On the app I love how fluid it is. It is so easy to use! After trying literally almost every to do app out there, this one gets my five stars! I have tried Google Tasks, Microsoft tasks, Wunderlist, Any.do, and many more. I've even paid for a majority of them. This one is well worth the money!",1
"Over time I've tried a lot of to-do list apps. Todoist has long been one I've come back to over and over and finally, I've settled on it as my favorite. During the past few years Todoist has helped me stay focused to grow my freelance business. It's also helped me when I get anxious and overwhelmed. I can easily set my daily list to just a few manageable tasks and move things to the back burner or ""inbox"". I love Todoist and its Getting Things Done methodology.",1
"Very clean, well organized to-do list app. It makes completing tasks feel rewarding with the 'karma' feature. The 'projects' feature really helps to organize large projects into more manageable, easy to schedule tasks, which helps you to complete the larger project easily. The only thing I dislike is the fact that the free version does not come with all of the features unlocked, but this app is still my favorite to use even without the extra features.",1
Great app and gets more helpful the more you use it to keep.track of your tasks. Works across multiple devices. It offers a good way tp organize your tasks without an cluttered interface. One feature i would like is the ability to.have asporational tasks that do not count for or against your karma score ie things that you can do if you have time but no problem if they dont get done. This app.has definitely changed my life for the better.,1
"Simply brilliant. Everything you could want. Thoughtfulness is the word that comes to mind whenever I discover a new feature. Some awesome big features like location reminders and integrations, and tons of clever little features too. free version has a respectable collection of features that don't let you down, but I'm seriously considering getting the premium version.",1
"My experience has been hit or miss. After listening to the developer on the YNAB podcast recently, with my new role in IT as a Solutions Architect, there is immense value in a proper organization and to do list application, especially task boards. Paid for premium. Unfortunately, when clicking a label in the left nav in favorites, it does nothing and you're still left viewing the Inbox, Today or Upcoming pane you were in. It doesn't filter or behave as it should. Edit: I was doing it wrong!",1
"It's a great app, but just like any organization app, you have to meet it halfway with actual effort. If you don't actually intend to complete the work, don't kid yourself by getting the app. I only wish it included a calendar that displayed events in chronological order along with the list of events in bullet point format and that it sent reminders of events. I'm very picky about apps, but this one is actually nice.",1
Genuinely out of this world. This app goes above and beyond in creating a seamless organising system that really allows you to get your mind off and scribble as many thoughts as possible and then organise them. And it tracks it perfectly. It syncs with the PC version excellently and rewards you for every task done making you feel the progress and it gives you many metrics to further illustrate how much you've done in a short period of time. One of the best out there üëç,1
"This is my dream personal planning app. I love the design, it looks and feels great to use. It's simple and intuitive but also very powerful. There any plenty of ways to group tasks, and the filters are very powerful for viewing them however you want. And it's fully featured. It has collaboration, a great widget, and integrations with a lot of other apps, including Google Assistant.",1
"So far, it's great. Just a small suggestion though: In ""comments section"" of tasks, if there are multiple images posted, and I click one to view, I should then be able to view the next one by swiping left/right. Instead I have to click off the image I'm currently on and scroll down the list of comments to find the next one. This was not intuitive to me, because in most SMS apps, whenever you view an image someone has sent you, if you swipe to the left/right, it will scroll through all images.",1
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.",1
"Really helps me keep track of things, love the integration of ""natural language"" for scheduling dates and times. If I had one complaint/suggestions it would be to make reminder notifications more noticeable. I feel I miss my reminders a lot. However, it's a small issue. Todoist has every feature I wanted from a To Do app, and more than a few I didn't know I needed.",1
"Awesome but not perfect. Best I've found so far, and I've tried a ton. With a lot of my workflow being email/outlook based, the plug-in is incredibly helpful. It's a little complex, but with great power comes a bit of learning curve. I have an Android phone, an iPad, and work in Windows so the cross platform nature is key for me. Missing a couple things I think are key like being able to enter a completed date in the past (yesterday at least). I'm getting far more done using the app.",1
"Very good to do list app! Looks nice, easy to create new tasks with the automatic detection of dates, times, priorities, and topic. Does not show ads and is pretty generous with the free version. My only issue so far has been occasional desync between devices (can be solved by logging out and logging back in). Also, note that the free version doesn't allow you to set reminders.",1
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",1
"I am a fan of GTD which is really just a system of lists. I have tried all the big name task managers out there. Todoist is by far my favorite. Once you catch on to the natural language processing it is so easy to record everything that comes to mind in the ""In"" box then do a review later to decide what to do. Since I always have my phone I use the notification bar icon to record stuff as I think of it. Nothing ever gets lost or forgotten. It is wondeful to have a septem you can depend on!",1
"I have been on a mission to find a to-do list that syncs well between my phone, smartwatch, and google calendar. I have tried just about every to-do list out there and in some aspect, every single one of them fell short. I was about to give up hope when I came upon this app! Thanks to this app, I am now the organized and productive person that I always knew I could be but never could find the right tool to make it happen!! Thank you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"This is a great to-do app. The interface is easy to use and looks great. Natural language scheduling works really well. ToDoist is supported on a wide variety of platforms. This includes Android and IOS. I really like that there is a phone app and web browser access. You can share projects with other users. Things to note: if you want to schedule your day, you can set due dates and time but you are better served using a calendar app. ToDoist isn't well suited for recurring checklists.",1
"This little app got me through my finals this quarter. The simplicity and variety of scheduling options makes it very useful. At first I thought premium was dumb and I wouldn't need it, but they offered a free 30 day trial without having to add my credit card and I quickly got addicted. Once the 30 day trial was over I couldn't go back so I paid the 36$ year which I would say is extremely reasonably priced. Very recommended, especially for school. Helped me stay on track and never miss any hmwk",1
"Very fun and intuitive app! Completing a task is rewarding, and the app is very good at notifying me of my tasks for the day. It is also great at organizing my tasks, and I love the option of adding a task to the Inbox - a great way to still add something without the immediate need to file it under a category. One issue I have is on Wear OS: on my Fossil Gen 6 (Wear OS 2), scrolling with the rotating crown causes a frenzy of vibration and the app to freeze. Please fix this!",1
"This app has helped me re-establish good habits, remember things when I couldn't afford to forget (very forgetful person) and conquer my procrastination bit by bit. The slightly gamified interface helps to make the app fun, and more personalized for me. I do wish it were a little more like a game, some level-ups and rewards wouldn't hurt. Overall, very useful and encouraging. Doesn't feel clingy or noisy.",1
Love this app! started with the free version and upgraded right away. It really helped me get my life and schedule under control when I started my business. I am still learning some of the more advanced ways to use it and find it gets more and more helpful with time. I love that i can send emails directly to it and make them into tasks and also i totally get into tracking my progress and getting points! im a geek like that LoL,1
"Fantastic app. I needed something like this to improve my productivity with reminders for work, and this app delivers more with cool features like projects, tags, priorities, comments, and so much more. The smart-typing and interpretation of text is amazing to set specific dates and tags just by typing, it really speeds up the process of creating tasks, which makes it easier to use and way more functional. I highly recommend the app, and the unlocked subscription fee is incredibly reasonable!",1
"Easy to use. It takes a second to get used to controls but then it super easy. I use the widget to add task throughout the day. My list stays condensed in my notifications. Only when I click on it, does it show me everything on my list. I love this app because it helps me remember things, and helps me stay on track when I have a million things going at once (I'm a Mom, Wife and Student).",1
"I had been looking for a to do list app with projects and connection to my calendar. There's a lot of stuff out there, but for some reason I fell in love with todoist. I saw it in a few YouTube videos and tried it out for myself and it has worked flawlessly. Two of my favorite features are projects and synchronization of my calendar and todoist on both sides. So if I add something to todoist, it gets added to my calendar and vice versa. Awesome, awesome utility!",1
"Best GTD app. If you are building a list system based on David Allen's book getting things done, I think this is absolutely the best app to use for that. I have had GTD systems on Evernote, Onenote, Microsoft to do, and a paper notebook, and this is by far the best in almost every way. It's easy to use, has no bugs, has a bunch of great bells and whistles, and it syncs seamlessly across all platforms. The user experience is great too. It draws me in to my lists, rather than repelling me.",1
Really helpful and awesome tool to have. Love that I can just reschedule things to different dates when I don't get around to them! Has definitely made it feel like life is more manageable when I can just add something as I think about it and schedule it to the most appropriate date... helps me not feel overwhelmed under an avalanche of things to do! Great app :),1
Perfect for organizing big life goals and daily tasks all in one. I've been using the pro version for 5 years now. I love how easy it is to organize tasks within one another and i use the scheduling features to their fullest extent. I use it on all my devices. Works well with small teams too. Now i never worry about losing an idea or missing a task. It's all written down forever and I never have to worry about what I forgot.,1
"Very pleased with us app This is a great app to do what it says -- to create To-Do lists. It's a great tool to use with the GTD - Getting Things Done-- approach. It is good for projects in so far that it allows you to create the next action (step) you need to take. it does have a ""due date"" option which I have not utilize, so it would seem to be beneficial in many cases. The website is slightly easier to manipulate to-do lists, but either way, the app and the website sync up wonderfully.",1
"I. Love. Todoist! I may not always accomplish every task I put into Todoist, bit I love that I have the list there. The news emails actually tell you the updates, it's quick, easy, yet so powerful. I have lists of songs I'm going to download, groceries, tasks for work, myself, reminders. It's beautifully done, the wideget works like butter! Thanks Todoist team for a great app!",1
"Simple to use but superior functionality & UI - best app for staying organized across all devices. Unbeatable for getting things done at the right time, especially when used with Pomodone app. Anyone who doesn't pay the small annual subscription isn't serious about their own success, and is unappreciative of what the Todoist team have achieved. Support these people!",1
"I really like this app and the smart tags feature of being able to tag it on a project which is super quick. You can also use boards like in Trello. A lot of really great functionality in this app. The only issues I've had is syncing between desktop app and phone a few times, but once I logged out and back in on app it synced my tasks so hopefully that will get fixed soon. I haven't tried doing that again, but I will soon.",1
"I used Apple Reminders for a while until I switched ecosystems. You have to pay to get the most out of it, but it's worth it to me. Excellent integration with Google Calendar and it works on all my platforms (Windows, Android, and Chromebook). Helps out a lot. Not the best voice assistant integration, but still great!",1
"I absolutely love this app. I have ADHD, am a chronic procrastinator, and have always struggled with organizing my schoolwork. As a brand new college student, this app has saved my life. I can set due dates, filter my to-do list by class, specify dates and times, and set tasks in order of priority. I keep all of my schoolwork on Todoist. A calendar was too hard to keep track of, but this allows me to see everything that is due right in front of me and the order in which I should do them. Love it",1
"The task manager to get. I've used it as a professional task manager and light PM tool for work, and my personal to do list for years. Worth the paid license, making it easy to see my tasks on a widget, set up categories, add reminders, enable recurrence, put in notes, and reschedule. Integration across Android and Windows works. The 'karma' system for progress keeps one motivated to be successful",1
"I love that this app allows me to create recurring To-dos. I have been using this app to help myself get on a routine. There is a lot of trial and error to to figure out what routine is best for me. Also, my priorities change from week to week. This app gave me the ability to completely rearrange my routine in 15 minutes. My only qualm is that on upcoming To-dos, repeating tasks only show for the most recent date. Otherwise, really enjoying this app.",1
"You don't have to pay for Todoist for it to be useful. At its core it is a digital to do list with flexibility for whatever you want to throw at it. You can schedule recurring routines easily, break down large projects into smaller subtasks and organize it all to your liking. I use Todoist as a big picture planner. The desktop program is what I use for weekly planning and task input. But when I'm out in the world making it happen the phone app is just as valuable. I say give it a try!",1
"So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.",1
"Have been using for a few months and I really enjoy it. I do wish for maybe more of a calendar integration with outlook but once I get it organized I think they work just fine in conjunction, meetings in outlook, tasks in todoist. I got pro just to make more projects but I think the free version is great for just personal organization.",1
"As I've gotten older, those ""Oh, I must remember to xyz"" thoughts get forgotten more readily. Short term memory isn't what it was. With Todoist, I can schedule, verbally, by Alexa, or by simply typing, any reminder. Such as ""take garbage out every Thursday at 7am"", ""change bank passwords every 2 months"". Todoist software is a great add-on to my life because it supplements my normal productivity engine. My productivity has always been a sense of pride. Todoist let's it continue to be so.",1
"After turning off *all* of the notifications, it's exactly the To Do app *I* need. Instead of sixty sheets of paper with projects I'm working on or was working on or ideas for art or groceries or whatever! I have this. I've been using it about a week, and so far, I think it's working out rather well.",1
"Todoist is absolutely fantastic! I just started using it, but it is already so helpful and amazing in my life. When I determined that Microsoft To Do was just not powerful enough for me, I sought out other options, and Todoist was the only one that 1, seemed to be functional and powerful, and 2, available cross-platform. I use an Android phone, iPad, and Windows/Linux laptop daily, and Todoist connects seamlessly with all of those devices. Thank you Todoist!!",1
"I got the app 2 weeks so am still in the learning phase but it's super intuitive to get started with so many great templates and ideas. The meal planning template is awesome and sooo much more useful than the meal plan app I have. Todoist has replaced apps I've used previously all for different things (calendar, tasks, recipes, ADHD centric apps). It's streamlined my life into just having to use one app to get my life together and for that, so worth it for the paid version.",1
"You won't be able to label, comment (add more details), or get reminders on the free version, but that makes the free version pretty fair. You'll be able to sort things by project and date and prioritize things, and that makes it easy to see what you're going to do from day to day. This is all in a smooth, ad free experience. Plus you get a nice notification every morning telling you what tasks are due that day.",1
"Todoist is an excellent app with excellent support. I use Todoist to help stay on top of the flow of information coming at me, have and also utilized the repeating task function for regular checklist items. I also love using the labels for contextual tasks, like emails, calls, errands, at home, at computer, etc. It's been a game changer in my ability to be productive and efficient. Todoist support is awesome, too. If you're looking to become more productive and retain a sense of control over the things you are (and are not) doing, HIGHLY recommend this app! I also recommend reading GTD.",1
"One of the most useful apps I've ever used. It has a charming, professional interface that takes to-do lists to another level. For someone whose life runs on systems, this is imperative to making sure my day gets done. It has saved me many times and offers some nice extra features with a premium subscription that is very helpful but possibly not necessary for everyone. I could go on but I'll just say try it and make your own conclusions.",1
This thing just keeps getting better and better. These guys are doing great. I loved the google calendar integration and discovered to my delight today that since its inception it has been improved on and I can now add a separate calendar integration per list for those few lists that need it. Sync is instant and oh so helpful. Thanks a lot guys!,1
"This app is my lifeline but it's insanely buggy the past couple weeks, and keeps crashing. Always has had a problem syncing with browser extensions as well. Either browser or the app won't update globally. Usually it's the browser that won't but lately the app won't update and the browser extensions are the only ones working properly. Please help fix this todoist! All the typical troubleshooting is not helping. 2.14 edit back up to 5 stars - update fixed! Woohoo üôåüéâ",1
"Pretty neat app, very simple. When you input tasks (I do it via voice input), you can simply add little details like ""change tires next Monday"" and it will automatically add it to monday. it parses your details bout very well. you can even add times and I dont even KNOW what else it could do. Great app! Also, i have different projects which have individual tasks, very organized.",1
"Love this app. I have debilitating ADHD (if you know, you know) and this app makes my life manageable. Filters and priority settings keep to do lists from getting scrambled and overwhelming. For example, I use the urgent/important paradigm for priority setting, and the filters are perfect. Integrate with Google calendar. Project management with subtasks. If you have executive dysfunction, even the free version of this is a life saver. Also desktop is Linux compatible so that's a huge plus for me",1
"I've tried multiple to-do list organizer applications and have found Todoist to be the best for me. Sync was a big problem cross platform for me even using Microsoft's To-Do. I'd create my lists ans tasks on my PC and then go to pull them up on my phone when on the job site onky to find nothing I had entered was there. This happened time and time again. so began my search and I found Todoist. It is fast, easy to organize. You can tag, prioritize, add photos. I really like the karma too!",1
There are so many to do apps out there and so many comparison articles it was difficult to even choose one. I tried several and this one definitely seemed like the best so I purchased the premium version and it is great. Save yourself some time and aggravation just get this one. Try the free version first. The premium cost is $3 per month subscription bille yearly for $36 and although there is no free trial of the premium version you do have 30 days for a refund if you don't like it but you will.,1
Todoist is my favorite to-do list app. I've tried several other to-do list apps in my life but I always come back to this one. What I love best about Todoist is its minimalist design. A lot of other apps are just too complicated or bloated. It looks great on the phone and web. Todoist has greatly improved my productivity in life and helped me meet many of my goals.,1
"I adore this app. I type in everything I need to get done, then sort it all by date and priority. At the beginning of the day, I pick three tasks to rate as priority one. At the end of the day, I can easily postpone tasks I didn't accomplish without feeling bad. I feel organized, and like I can finally tackle my seemingly endless to-do list in a logical manner.",1
"This app is easy to learn and use, and yet so powerful. It has been extremely robust and supports every common desktop and mobile platform. Adding a task with natural language scheduling is such a breeze! It also supports queries to view your tasks in many different ways. The free version is complete and usable, with no ads! But I'm seriously considering upgrading to pro just to support these developers. It takes a lot of skill and dedication to make an app this robust and well designed.",1
"This app has improved my life so much. It's true that once I get the tasks written down, it clears my head for better management of the rest of my day/responsibilities. I can either make a list of things to do in general or assign tasks to certain days/times. I can make different lists for different projects. I REALLY ‚ù§Ô∏è the homescreen widget that I see whenever I check my phone. Some features you can choose to pay for, but the free version has enough features to do what I need. Never deleting!",1
"this app has been great for keeping track of what I have to do each day. it conveniently syncs on all of my devices so it's always up to date no matter where I am and what device I'm using. it's easy and satisfying to mark something as ""complete"". it reminds you when you have overdue tasks, but gives you the option to quickly reschedule them to another time so you dont feel guilty. all in all, it's a great app that does exactly what it needs to do! highly recommended!",1
"Incredibly convenient and simple, but I hope that the feature to attach photos (from your gallery or straight from your camera), links, and documents can be without the premium. Just a really naive wish, coming from a student. Other than that,  this app is really good, and its customer service is as admirable. Good job!",1
"Best task manager I have EVER used. Much more usable than most gamified task managers, but still has a nice experiemce point and goal mechanic. Completely intuitive. Hotkeys make it fast and easy to input tasks, and having multiple project lists . My favorite feature is how I can dump an entire semester's worth of homework in my todo list at once, not get overwhelmed, and know that it will show up in my daily task list right on time. I recommend this so often.",1
Ive tried so many similar apps to keep my tasks and thoughts organized. I needed an app that made sense to my way of thinking. This app makes the most sense to me. The ability to have many layers of sub-tasks is a big plus for me. But my favorite feature is the smart recognition of date and time. Half of my homescreen is now a widget for this app. it makes life easier to see my tasks every time i open my phone. This app has been a big game changer for me.,1
"I've used this 2018. It's the best free to-do list app on the market. Sometimes they update and it sucks, but they are quick to listen and make course-corrections. The app has tons of extras that you can use, some free, some paid. But I'm a simple guy who wants a simple to-do list app and this does it for me. 5 stars for the consistency, simplicity, and for listening to their customers when they make a mistake.",1
"This app has an effective workflow and really makes it easy to create, organize, and view tasks. I didn't do any of the sharing features, but it has been working great for personal task organization and planning. It does take frontend time and effort to import all of the single and recurring tasks into the app while getting familiar with many interesting features, but once I got that set, the workflow has been amazing!",1
"I can not add or remove labels from tasks via the labels pop-up, only by typing it in the task title. Please fix this, otherwise it is a wonderful app! :)",1
"Best in class app but very expensive (so 4 stars) At least there should be family sharing option at this price. Also, even the most basic apps offer reminders but here it is paid feature",1
its very simple to use,1
"1. When I reschedule a recurring task (like for later time the same day) it loses the ""recurring"" trait, which has been a source of much confusion over recurring tasks ""disappearing"" after they are completed. This is not an issue if I reschedule such task by clicking buttons like ""tomorrow"". There should be a warning if a task is about to lose this trait.",1
fantastic üòç,1
"Well if there is a way to remove the history of all the items added by default (download aps, awnser questions, etc) I'd bring this to 5. Some people don't like unnecessary clutter anywhere. I don't want these on my to-do list. Beyond that I realize I have only one thing really to do. Thanks lol",1
This is the app which makes your scheduling more productive.,1
Best todo app out there on so many levels. I like the cleaner update as well. But you deleted my Noir theme!,1
"Would love an easy access pure calendar view, especially if also available in widget form. I know this is more of a tasks app than a calendar app but theres really no reason why it cant have a simple dedicated calendar as well. Also, the Android widget still doesnt sync with the system light/dark mode. Otherwise, its perfect. I've been using Todoist for years and I can't imagine ever going back to life without it. It's the smoothest and most consistent tasks app out there.",1
"Once you get the hang of it, it's really easy to use. I like the labels features alot as well. It's easier to navigate through tasks by just searching the label. The widgets are also very efficient.",1
"Good app, needs an option to disable the 'reschedule' option that appears if you don't do a task. I just want to start at a blank screen each day and not be nagged by the app to reschedule something that was day-specific to begin with.",1
Ok,1
love it other than I wish there were more widget options.,1
"Great app, but you guys nerfed the widget design in the most recent update. Before you could make the entire widget transparent. It was clean and blended in well with the background but now the header is no longer transparent and it just looks bad on the home screen.",1
"Like the app, but please bring back the widget style! The new one looks terrible!",1
Please bring back the old mobile dark theme for the widget! I loved the minimalist look with no colors and the ability to turn the opacity down completely. Would be 5/5 stars with this design feature back in place.,1
"Great app. But i think i found a bug where when i try to type in a time like ""8pm"" it corrects to ""88pm"" adding an extra 8 right after i type the p",1
"The only things I would like to see added to this app are: 1) progress bars - so we can mark if a task is in progress, and 2) having completed tasks be deleted by the next day, 3) the search tab ends up force closing the app...",1
It's very good app but I am unable to add and delete team members,1
"I would like to remind you about 2 issues that are many years old. 1. When you need to attach files to a task, you can do it only one by one. 2. Activity logs are organized terribly, if you need to find something old there ‚Äî even the snackbar covers the button and prevents loading logs.",1
"kindly add ""text color change"" facility to mark important keywords easily. it will be helpful for us.",1
Great software. Excellent as a widget but your newest update needs keyboard focus immediately activated on clicking the search button like it always has. If it goes away which it seems to do more often than before as well...arbitrarily just turned 40 task searches a day into 80-120 unnecessary clicks. It's not even clear where the form is looking around the screen (there at the top) Repeatedly pressing search button again waiting for the keyboard to open up so I can actually begin searching,1
"Love this app, but.. It's now CRASHING whenever I select the SEARCH option. Please help!!",1
Great so far,1
hard to see completed tasks or revive mistakenly clicked ones. don't like implicit word conversion to create repeating tasks,1
"The app is great and pretty much the best I've used yet. I have been using it for months, but I can't see my scheduled tasks in the Today view. Todoist team pls work on this.",1
"Brilliant app. Uncluttered and easy to use. It works offline too which is important to me as I live in an area with unstable internet connectivity. For me, perfection will be to see long-term, repeatable and annual tasks.",1
good enough,1
"I like the app. I mainly use it for the karma system, it keeps me motivated. I think there should be a Prestige mechanic where you can earn a point/medal for reaching the highest Karma Level. You can choose to Prestige back to Beginner Karma Level, which allows you to obtain a rare ""trophy"" (the medal) to share with your friends.",1
"Great app for managing tasks, the pro version is too costly however.",1
"Love Todoist. ISSUE: Pixel Pro 8. Add widget (+) immediately disappears when dropped on the home screen, so I have no way to quick add.",1
"I loved it until the latest update. I was using the karma view to help keep track of recently completed tasks, and that particular piece of usability is now hidden more than it was before, and I needed instructions to find it again, the process was not at all intuitive.",1
"Todoist is the truly the best to-do app available in the market, especially in terms of its NLP and integrations. I mean it. My issue is with the pricing plans. As a simple user who uses other tools for notes and collaboration, the only useful premium feature for me would be the reminders, which honestly aren't worth the price asked. There are tools like Notion that offers better collaboration features in a more competitive price. I'd prefer a cheaper tier without all these advanced stuff.",1
I really like the interface. it's super friendly and motivating with its activity log and everything. I don't like the fact that reminders can only be set in premium,1
"Great app. I pay for the subscription because I find the app invaluable for creating structure in my life. However, there was a recent update that changed how reminders are set, and while I do like the new feature, I wish they didn't remove the old one that allowed you to type a specific reminder with your keyboard. For example, I used to be able to type in something like, ""every other Sunday at 8am"", but now I can only select a specific date and time unless I use Todoist on my PC.",1
"Have always found this one of the best apps in this category, but since the last update is now continually shutting down the app every time you update or save a task.....very frustrating.",1
Wonderful app to help organize,1
"It is a cool app, with a lot of helpful features. I look for simple features which makes our life tension free and todoist has it. Only problem; well, I would totally appreciate the notification thing which is only applicable to premium customers, but I feel it is a waste of money to subscribe to unlock only that feature. So all good except for thatüëç",1
App keeps force closing. I've used the app for years without issues. Developers please address the issue.,1
Please add a student discount,1
"Love this app, I needed something with a widget so I can see my to-dos on my home screen (otherwise I forget!). However I find when I create a new task from the widget, sometimes choosing which project to add it into doesn't work - it adds the text to specify but then it changes to just regular text and doesn't recognise it as the code to specify the project anymore. Otherwise, working great!",1
Would be 5 stars if reminders came with the free plan. Otherwise great all round task manager.,1
Good.,1
Todoist keeps closing on my Note 8. Started a few days ago. Appear to have the latest version installed.,1
The app kept closing after latest update but now the problem is fixed. Thank you,1
"I love this app, but it's not as user friendly as on a laptop.",1
I wish it would give me notifications on what I have to do,1
"Todoist is a fantastic app that helps me keep my life organized and never miss a task. I have tried many task apps and todoist is by far the best. I have been using the app now for 3 years and it keeps getting better. This app lowers my stress levels during busy times as I know that I can focus on the task at hand without forgetting anything else I need to do. I love that I can tag tasks based on how they relate to each other, though my favorite feature is the smart recognition scheduling tool!",1
"Aplicativo bom para organizar a vida. Se come√ßar a travar, √© necess√°rio desinstalar e instalar novamente",1
"It would be great if you implement ""The Carrot & The Stick"" system. My suggestion: Allow user to make a big custom note on the very top of the view about the rewards (if completed all tasks) and the punishment (if tasks are not completed) in ""Today"" menu.",1
"It's a nice app, well thought out. But too expensive for a casual user.",1
"shortcuts to quick actions like add task and search have disappeared in last version. edit: no response from the developers, changing the review to 1 star edit 2: developer replied with a link to instructions, which helped: log out and log in again. changed rating to 5 stars. Update: search on non English text stopped working. the tasks with the title using non ASCII symbols won't be found.",1

I have been using this app since last year I guess. App is great and you can add organize the labels to match your subjects. I have been experiencing some problems though. Sometimes it would lag or it is too late to respond and sometimes I can't open the app though it is for a short while. I hope you can fix this,1
must login and need premium to reminder time,1
Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 10/23 edit update. Giving another star back cause it's 4 years later and I still use this app everyday so obviously useful. Recently have had an issue with it not opening up occasionally but for some reason opens if I go to Google play store and open from there. Odd/annoying but still useful and will likely be fixed like the previous issue was which caused me to rate it lower.,1
"It's very gud app for enhancing productivity, I took its premium after which many times I'm facing issue of complete white screen while opening the app. Please resolve it.",1
"A task planned in a future date may become critical at times. Ca we have a ""my day"" type feature where we can plan the day?",1
Good app to keep write down your tasks,1
"On a Pocophone F3, running MIUI 14 (Android 13), there's what I would call a ""error"" when the app shows the images corresponding to having accomplished all of the tasks for one day and not having found a given search. What happens is that the images are displayed but they're done so over a white square (I'm using dark mode)",1
Works great. Wish it had calendar functionality.,1
Good,1
"This is an amazing app for my ADHD, I love it. But some updates make it weird to use. With the latest update, if I make ""laundry"" a task, then make a new task ""Sweep floors"" it will put ""laundry"" as soon as I start typing. If I use a label, sometimes there is no label unless I tap on the task to enlarge the view. Some tasks show the entire label ""Medical"" on regular view, other tasks show ""Me..."" and it gets annoying. Overall amazing otherwise. Also would love to see more colors for labels.",1
"Todoist been great , but lately I've discovered a bug that deleted all my past task datas on google calendar My g cal and todoist has been synced and the feature was working great but for the recurring events that i added to the todoist from calendar every time that i check a recurring task completed for a specific day at a specific amount of time for like 2 hs The next week that I'm checking the time that i spent on specific tasks ,i realize there isnt tasks event on gcal.",1
"The best feature is detecting date and time while typing. Free version is very good and doesn't annoyingly pester you with popup ads. I wish I could individually buy features like themes, but it is a subscription... If you're not too crazy about tagging and mostly about speed and efficiency, this free app is for you.",1
"Awesome! Best of all worlds. Inbox for ideas that doesn't clutter priority items to get done. Easy scheduling and projects with multiple layers of sub projects. Easy to hide sub projects and assign to different days. Easy to tag, prioritize, sort, etc. In the past, I would use a list, it would get cluttered and overwhelming, then I would start a whole new list in defeat. With Todoist, I actually get to the end of my list, before the end of the day.",1
I almost went with TickTick because of the calendar within the app and the habits feature. But in the end I just couldn't pass up the level of organization that Todoist offers. I have ADHD and I really need visuals to get through my days. This app seems to work well with how I think. I feel good at the end of the day when I can clear out my tasks. The integration with Google calendar is useful for planning my days. I will most likely pay for premium.,1
awesome,1
"""Todoist simplifies task management with its intuitive interface, seamless cross-platform sync, and powerful features. A must-have for productivity enthusiasts!""",1
Translate,1
This app is my personal loyal assistant. Thank you! üß°,1
"amazing app, the natural text is really cool. Quick idea though: default settings for due dates? As in: when i add a todo item, there is a default due date (today, tomorrow, in two weeks) already selected which i can overwrite with ""august 4th"" or whatever. this would help out a lot since i mostly work from the today and upcoming view and sometimes forget to add a due date and then the task is just gone into the void forever",1
Superb use case flow! Board layout for multiple task lists is awesome üëç Hands down best todo list app I've tried.,1
"Todoist is a fantastic app that helps me keep my life organized and never miss a task. I have tried many task apps and todoist is by far the best.

"Simple and convinient way to organize your everyday. That's a shame you have to have a premium account to set reminders, but I guess they have to make money someway. I haven't felt restricted by anything else with a free account.",1
"You can install it on pc, you can set priorities, you can repeat tasks and most of all the UI is simple and functional. I wish I found out about it earlier.",1
very useful and time productive app. When I start using it i become very disciplined and punctual. Thanks Todoist,1
So far it's better than expected,1
"I have been using to-do lists for over 15 years to plan out my daily life and critical goals. Todoist is the best designed, most comprehensive, and easiest to use system I have ever tried. Anyone can use this system to great advantage and, as a new user, I keep finding more and better tools within Todoist. This app is a lot of fun!",1
The only ToDo app. I have tried that I still use. If there was a way of tracking regular tasks I did not do that would be good. Currently I check the task off as if it is done. e.g. when the task did not need doing because of circumstance but I don't want to remove the task.,1
"Amazing I'm competiting with my friend for 75 days, best function is that we can share our task",1
Been using this app for 3 years now. Love the features. Especially the keybinds and shortcuts to add elements to the task list. This has been my go to for any Todo List I make for whatever project or work load Im handling. The consistent updates and the features offered just in the free version are extremely impressive and effective. Love the work and effort from the devs. Definitely look forward to avail the subscription soon as I graduate.,1
"I've used this 2018. It's the best free to-do list app on the market. Sometimes they update and it sucks, but they are quick to listen and make course-corrections. The app has tons of extras that you can use, some free, some paid. But I'm a simple guy who wants a simple to-do list app and this does it for me. 5 stars for the consistency, simplicity, and for listening to their customers when they make a mistake.",1
Best app now,1
just love it I can't life without this app,1
"The best To Do list, and it's cross platform!",1
good staff for remembering task and recurring tasks,1
Works perfectly well for me. I can plan my task for each day and still get reminders when I skip.,1
"Great app. I am effectively able to manage my tasks and organise my work. One of the best to-do apps I have used till now. I love its labels, categories and easy to move task options.",1
"Best todo app on the market. As a feature request, would be nice to have an option to set up several personal spaces.",1
"It's available everywhere and on everything, even Linux.",1
"This app has an effective workflow and really makes it easy to create, organize, and view tasks. I didn't do any of the sharing features, but it has been working great for personal task organization and planning. It does take frontend time and effort to import all of the single and recurring tasks into the app while getting familiar with many interesting features, but once I got that set, the workflow has been amazing!",1
great,1
Fantastic app. It has a lot on the free tier but I bought a yearly subcription and do not regret it - the reminder capabilities are fantastic!,1
Great app,1
Good app üëå,1
Best one so far,1
awesome,1
"New version should be as before: when hitting the search button, keyboard should pop up and not wait for us to hit the search line to do so. And by hitting the back button while in app, screen should go to the default page and not the browser page. Thanks üôè",1
My daily go to app,1
"I've been searching left and right for a good app to manage my ADHD, and so far it proves better than any other app I've tried. The option for a constant reminder is a MUST HAVE for stubborn people like me. The all around flexibility is incredibly accommodating. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the habits feature. My habits haven't been displaying properly. It will only display up to 3 of them, and anytime I try to add more they are seemingly non-existent.",1
"I keep coming back to this app and learning more and liking it more. The list mode was really overwhelming until I realized I could tag all my tasks and see them in my list by tag. OR in kanban mode separated by tag. Seeing your list based on tags took this app from falling short to a game changer. I think it's a bit funky that when collaborating on a list, scheduled tasks that are assigned to my spouse, that I'll still get notified.",1
"Very useful app. I've been using it for personal and office tasks since about a year now. And it's clear that it has increased productivity both at work and at home. Now, my colleague and I could efficiently handle appointments and task planification. Might be a good idea to have task analytics so as to be able to see a dashboard of how many task have been completed on a certain period and how much time have been spent on different group of tasks, etc.",1
Todoist is a straightforward app that is easy to manage with customizable views. It brings sophistication without the complication.,1
Helps not to forget things,1
Great ui,1
"Thank you Todoist - this is the exact platform I was looking for! I love that they don't limit the number of levels of subtasks and you can expand/condense them in one view. The natural language processing took me a second to learn but it makes it more customizable. The filters make prioritizing my work a breeze. This is all available on the free version, and if I upgraded it's at an affordable price point. I tried Asana and Click Up, and I'm now a Todoist convert. Join the dark/organized side.",1
"Have you ever used a program/app and said, 'I wish I could change it so it worked like this...'. Everytime I have this thought, ToDoist provides me with a way to get it done. I have never used such a customizable, efficient, intuitive product! I didn't take advantage of the full features until 1 year into use (my own fault). I wish the creators of this wonderful program developed electronic medical records; you could revolutionize healthcare.",1
So far so good!,1
"Edit: Everything is great now, thanks for the best to-do app! I use this app everyday since 2018 and I can't describe how much it helped me to manage my tasks and everything. I really love it, but lately the widget doesn't work properly and you can't deselect completed tasks on it. Since I mainly use the widget, this is really problematic and I hope something can be done about it",1
"After recent update, the widget will no longer update automatically to match the app listing; this includes completing tasks, adding tasks, or a new day starting.",1
Very good app. Very useful for my day to day activities. But I have only 02 following issues. 01. When you click the search üîé button it gets quitted. Earlier version didn't have this issue. 02. here's no way to find how many items are there in inbox. This too was there in older version Can you attend to it please?,1

"i will not change the score which I already put as 5 stars, because I trust the amount of effort you put in to bring Todoist to existence. But please consider returning back seeing sub-projects tasks when viewing parent project. Romoving it is not a good step, I believe this change was not studied well in advance; I cannot figure out why you remove a feature as useful as this one.",1
"I have been using this app for several years. It's great and really helps get the work done! However, I wish it would have a calendar/month view (like Google Calendar or TickTick), not just a small drop down window with the number of tasks. Putting it at 4 stars for now because of that, will change it to 5 if t ever gets that feature",1
very nice interface and options. wish the main storage was my personal Google drive,1
"I love this app, it's helping me daily, I regularly use this , love this",1
It really helped me get my life in order. Would recommend for anybody who is looking for an intuitive and effective way to organise their tasks,1
easy to use,1
Genial,1
"I got lucky that this is the first to-do list app I have ever used. It is excellent in every way! It allows you to add items, prioritize items, move items around on your list, categorize items, and has multiple inboxes all with the free version. More options are available for the premium version if you need them.",1
"I am a firm believer that task management tools have to fit in with one's personal style of thinking and checking off and organizing tasks. For me, I spent many weeks or months trying different tools and chose todoist. Been a while now, and it has made life so much simpler for me. The projects/labels/filters etc work perfectly for the way I organized things. The quality has been pretty good too.",1
"I tried multiple list/schedule apps this week, this one (fingers crossed) is working out great. I am using the free version for 3 days so far, easy to understand and if confused, many little videos to show the different features. I also have fallen in love with the complete for the day, I battle with depression so keeping lists helps me know I am accomplishing things but this app goes above my expectations with the graph showing how you are doing, thank you programmers",1
"This app makes my life easier! Very comprehensive features, consistent, stable and, above all, easy to use. I had been long searching for a powerful, networked, yet straightforward app to do project management that would include my team members. Nothing fitted the bill until I found Todoist. The fact that I can use it on mobile or desktop makes it even more versatile! This one is among my 3 favorite apps. Big thank you to the developers... keep up the good work, guys!",1
"This is the best to-do app I've used due to the subtask power. For example, I can assign due dates for individual subtasks in addition to the main task. This is extremely beneficial in managing one's time. Also, the inbox is, in my opinion, brilliant. I can input, via voice recognition , a task that needs to be done. I don't know when I can get to it and I don't know how I want to categorize it. So, I put it in the inbox to be scheduled and categorized when time permits. Projects are great also.",1
"This app is a great to do list app, and it makes a great homework planner. I use this with the board view at school and it is awesome. I have a school Chromebook and the PWA is top-notch, and the Android app is great at sending notifications for homework assignments. Also, the widgets are great and the free plan. 10/10 experience!",1
"I find the app very intuitive and robust for my needs. I love the various thoughtful integrations (i.e., Outlook and with my Google Assistant). My one minor complaint is the frequency of updates to the app and desktop version. I've worked with software developers before and standard practice is to bundle updates together in less frequent releases. Here, it is not unusual to have several updates per month.",1
"I switched to ToDoist after Wunderlist got purchased and ruined and to be honest, I kind of wish I had made the switch earlier. There's a bit of a learning curve, but the flexibility and power of Todoist is excellent. The natural language components for scheduling is wonderful, and I love the ability to organize into projects and use custom tagging. The boards display is basic but for the most part sufficient for simple projects and I love the ability to switch to that view for projects that have more of a Jira style flow to them.",1
"This app really is my favorite task list. I previously used todoist a year ago but wanted to try out google notes for the sake of keeping all the services under one google product. I really made an effort to get used to google notes but it just wasn't cutting it. todoist is so cool and awesome, my favorite feature is the option of a widget when you swipe down from the top, anyways, just wanted to say IM BACK!!!",1
"My experience with Todoist has been great. It has helped me keep track of all my college assignments that I must complete. It's also helpful that it reminds you when things are overdue. Making the list is very simple as well. All you do is press the + button, type the thing you need to do, press the > button, and BAM! you're all set.",1
"Pleasant app to use! The application is very simple and I find it very intuitive. It is quick and easy to create new tasks. Adding time and dates to task is streamlined by using the ""auto-detecting due date feature"" within the app. I am pretty new to using ""to-do""/organization apps, and I find this application as great starter and/or a great addition to tools you already use!",1
"By far the best task management app I have used, and i have tried A LOT both professionally and personally. The integration with google calendars is a life saver, there are a lot of options that I always wished for in other apps (sharing with other people, repeating tasks, multiple projects, easy to move between projects, SUPER low maintenance). Bought premium immediately and deleted all my other task apps.",1
"I have tried a lot of productivity apps and this one is hard to beat. consistently works, good label and project settings. The base app is good but premium is ideal and a fair price. I wouldn't get half as much done without it. The daily and weekly goals keep me going. It's easy to organize and see what areas you've put time into and reprioritize.",1
supper app but tutorials should be in hindi for indians,1
"This thing makes me productive by default. Its almost addicting. I wouldn't knock out a physical planner just yet. Todoist, from my understanding has only complented any type of schedueling sustem I had and made it more effective by allowing me to fill it up with things I need to get done and want to get done without any sort of complicated U.I. although. Dredful priorities are still dreadful regardless of what you write them on(paper, elctronic, etc..), todoist is definitely an ally.",1
"12/1/20 edit: All of my previous grievances have been corrected and improved upon including being able to add new tasks with due dates in the widget and having them auto-sort. Props on the improvements, keep up the good work :) March review: New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.",1
"Great App! No complaint at all. I have friends who like using actual planners and notbooks to plan their day/week, but i decided to give this app a chance and paid for the annual subscription and it's really worth it. We can sometimes forget to have with us our planner but we never forget our phones and that's why this app has helped me a lot to get my tasks done. I trully recommend it (In its premium version though).",1
"My favorite to-do app out of the insane plethora of to-do apps. I tried a lot but this one stuck with me the most. The key for me was how simple it is but powerful at the same time. A quick ""Water plants every other Saturday p3 #House"" correctly identifies the list it belongs to, sets up the frequency and marks its priority. This app seriously puts me in control of my day so nothing ""slips"" my mind any more. I have recommended it to my boss and he also loves it.",1
This is my favorite to do list app! I would use motion if it were as used friendly as this app. But todoist is so much more efficient and smooth (fewer clicks to create tasks for example). And you can categorize lists but also filter those same tasks based on things like high priority or tasks that require you to leave your house. Search todoist filter/label tutorials!,1
"Absolutely love this app. So easy to add and organize to-do items, prioritize tasks, manage projects. Works well everywhere. Technically, it's not supposed to be compatible with my Windows 10 64-bit version, but I use it there anyway, and it works most days. Totally worth the cost for the Pro version. I'd be far less productive without it.",1
"I had been looking for some type of way to view all of my tasks without the overwhelm of poster boards. I have notebooks galore, and none of it seemed to help me get organized. Todoist has an amazing layout that helps me chunk down my projects and goals so that I am able to get everything out of my head and into a database which makes it easier to create systems for my work and my life in general. It's easy to use, and I can stay up to date conveniently whereever I am on any device.",1
"excellent interface for setting appts, rescheduling, and editing tasks. It is super easy to use and will help keep you on schedule as you watch your productivity grow. I would recommend it to anybody looking to increase thier production by staying organized and on schedule. I manage properties and so tracking lists and appointments are very essential to my occupational success.",1
"Been using the app every day for years to track everything I need to get done from day to day. One of my favorite apps. It's likely my #1 most used app. Easy to use. Update: Since the radio buttons were added to mark tasks as complete, Im findind that sometimes tasks are accidentally being remived from my list. Not a fan of the radio buttons! - too easy to accidentally click in them.",1
"This app has basically solved my ADHD and I recommend it for anyone who needs help organizing tasks. I wish there was a self-improvement / casual / one-time-supporters pro version for $10-15 that adds in only the reminders feature and doesn't have a subscription fee. I also think the ""upcoming"" screen should have a project filter button to the right of the hamburger menu, so that you can filter the upcoming menu by project without being taken to the project menu that removes the helpful date focused design of the upcoming menu.",1
I appreciate how easy it is to create and modify a To-Do List. The ability to group multiple Lists under a Project Title is very useful. I also like the Sub-Task feature which allows me to add details to a specific Task. Another feature that I found to be helpful is the email notifications that monitor my scheduled Tasks. The Application feature set is well thought out. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs an organizational tool to help them be more productive.,1
"By far the best task management app I've ever used. Supports labels, projects, due dates, has reliable notifications, a gamification system, a great interface, support for every major OS.. I couldn't be more satisfied. The integration with Google Home is less than ideal, but that is a small complaint.",1
"I'm an OCD business owner and this app is perfect for me. If you want clean widgets on your home screen for quick and easy tasks and goal setting this app beats all the others. I personally wasted 12 hours researching and playing around with the task and to do apps and these guys take the cake. Great UI, great customizability, not too try hard. I love how you can create lists for different things and set different categories on the same list so you don't have to hit back when swapping lists.",1
"The perfect todo app. It's so easy and quick to set up really powerful filters and workflows to make sure you're focusing on the tasks that matter most. Not to mention the performance and UX is super snappy, so you can note, organize, and check off tasks without wasting time you could spend getting things done fumbling with the app.",1
"i spent a long time deciding which task management tool to use, i tried pretty much all the major players. after trying them all for a few days, I settled on Todoist. never looking back! the natural language processing, repeat options and projects hooked me in. When i finally got Premium, i found the filter query language extremely powerful. despite what i read online, Alexa integration works perfectly! love it.",1
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity.",1
"This is a very good reminder app. Reminders entered on mobile or web site sync perfectly. The only thing missing is a Due-like (Apple only) ability to issue annoying notifications. With TickTick, you get one notification. If you're not near your phone, you won't know you've missed a task until next time you pick up your phone. It'd be great if TickTick would issue a *new* notification every X minutes (user-controlled) until you acknowledge, so that you never miss a notification.",1
I have tried many applications for to-do list. this one is the most versatile and the one that I find most intuitive to me,1
"i use this app because it helps keep me organized in my personal life. i tried others but found this did what I want better. i can use my phone, pc, mac and it interfaces seamlessly with my calendar.",1
Best todo list manager app I've used. One feature that would be nice is an option for recurring tasks to auto-postpone if they're missed.,1
Nice,1
love it so much. keeps me organised,1
like the format. very east to use.,1
"This app has provided structure to my entire life since I downloaded it. <-- That was my original review a while back. I am now here to say, this app is simply outstanding. I thank my whole life for it. It syncs sublimely across all my devices, works well on Mac OS and android devices that I use, and it is actually an absolute joy to use as well. The developers have done an excellent job. If you're reading this guys, thank you and well done. I love you. I wish the widget had day/night modes",1
"I added the widget to my home screen, so every time I think of something, I add it to sort out later at my desk. #gamechanger",1
"After 10+ years of use, I am extremely satisfied.",1
managing my to do lists has never been better,1
"This is a superb app and I can't come up with anything negative to say. However, as I private (low volume) user, it would be nice to have at least limited reminder functionality or once-off payment to unlock the feature. It doesn't make much sense to pay 5$ per month just for the sake of having reminders, as majority of products nowadays offer that for free.",1
"Great support team, helped me resolve me issue!",1
I use the app all the time. The best feature in my eyes is that you can customize the filters with basically no limits.,1
I use Todoist constantly for all kinds of lists and tasks!,1
user since 2017. will be a user forever!!!!,1
"The free version is sufficient for every day needs. Naturally, premium is much more of a wonderful purchase! 10/10",1
Super helpful to me!,1
everything I needed to track my commitments for home and work together: all of life. thank you!,1
love it,1
the bestüëå,1
love this app. using it daily to organize my life,1
"ToDoist is the best free to do manager I've seen. It is structured in a very organized and powerful way, such as in how recurring tasks work or in the intelligent way it interprets input text. I love that I can share tasks with my spouse.",1
Fast and easy to use. Multiple levels of sub tasks is really nice!,1
"From simple tasks to complex recurring schedules, this app does it all and makes it really easy to keep things orderly.",1
"Better Interface, No ads or promotional stuff, just stock notch performance",1
"Very Friendly user interface, extremely customizable on pro, and generally seems like it's designed by someone who has dealt with adhd/add or organizational challenges and gets how to consolidate the executive function into one effective virtual format. Thank you 1000%",1
"most useful, versatile, and intuitive task organizer I've ever used",1
"Excelente, solo tuve un problema con agregar descripciones que se solucion√≥ con salir de la cuenta y volver a entrar. 10 puntos",1

"Muito bom! Muitas funcionalidades √∫teis (importar .csv, filtros, agrupamento, labels, ordena√ß√£o...). Tudo que precisava encontrei.",1
Great app. I recommend it,1
nice aap alo reminds me my all day task thankyou ü§ó,1
This app is exactly what I was looking for as someone with ADHD. It's easy to reassign dates and rearrange tasks by priority or category. The free version is really excellent!,1
"This is exactly what I needed. Great app, intuitive interface and with really pretty widgets. It's useful to keep routine events that ""don't deserve"" a calendar mention. Also integrates nicely with calendars to fetch events and pairs well with Todoist. Too bad there's no exposed API so I can integrate with Trello, Github and such. Also, browser addon would be nice.",1
"Great app. only thing that bothered me is the notifications only pop up when I open the app,so it doesn't remind me to check in.",1
Its amazing to use this app. Very simple and ad free. Not clumsy.,1
beats Google keep by a long shot,1
Perfect,1
Very good,1
Simple and concise task planning tool,1
Far better than Google Tasks. Great app and user experience!,1

it's an easy app to understand.,1
works really good,1
The app is nicely designed. It's great that you can organize tasks by lists and sections and sort them by due date (nice for knowing what to take on next) or title (neat for shopping lists and packing your baggage). Sharing lists is very convenient for common tasks shared with family and friends. I'd love it if there were three levels of importance instead of just two.,1
Perfect,1
very excellent app for reminders,1
Good app.,1
easy to use,1
It took me 3 days to figure that my outlook work calendar not syncing was not the app's fault but a company IT policy issue. I don't understand why you don't point users in the right direction in your FAQ? You're probably loosing quite a few potential clients who probably just give up where they could just chat to their IT administrator to sort it out. Also I cant access the detail view pressing on an event on the watch? Wherever I press it just keep switching between 12h and 24h view,1
"It's probably the closest app to what I'm looking for. I'd really like to be able to either style or disable monochrome mode, and have the option to use the same style between the watch face and home widget so I don't have to go back and forth in the settings to make them match",1
"Love the app and! I have issues remembering when things are and the app is really great for helping me visualize it! One thing I'm not a fan of, the widget is just a copy of the watch on your phone. I was hoping that it would be a timeline or something, bit having a second watch on my phone isn't useful IMO.",1
"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.",1
"Made a Persona style day-part clock with this app, and it really has helped me stay on track. I have a fairly set schedule, so this is really helpful. I can imagine it being a bit more difficult to keep up with if you are constantly adding reminders to it, so I don't know if I could recommend it to someone who has a wild schedule.",1
"It was struggle to get the right resize dat I wanted. but what this app did best was ""a unique scheduling set up I could not pass away. I had to invest."" I look forward to more apps and more innovative ways than to do the str8 path. We all need the str8 path but the way life comes at us sum of what we want never really comes win we desire them to. So if we don't persist around uniquely. Such time will be lost.",1
"Almost perfect, there are two issues; 1. The watchface doesn't fill the whole screen on the galaxy 4 (and many others judging on photos online), there is about a 1/8""+ extremely visible ring of unused screenspace around the watchface 2. Text wrapping isnt very good. Overall great watchface, I literally bought a new watch just to use this, only real gripe is that lack of Fullscreen, worth $$$",1
Overall great but could be better? Great way to display the data as a watchface. I do wish that once I change the color for a recurring event that the app would remember it. I like having the tile version as well when I want to change the watch face to something else.,1
"Normally it's amazing. I love this app and the widget. Lately, though, the widget isn't updating like it should. It's not running concurrently with real time. I sometimes will look and it will be 5 or 6 hours behind the actual clock. If I click it to open the app, it fixes this issue for a little while, but it will eventually happen again.",1
"Great app, I've really been enjoying using this app to see and divide my days and chores. Something I wish it could have could be an option for it to have a sort of alarm. With an alarm we could be hear that an important meeting is about to start or something like that. Other than that, the app itself is really useful and thus far haven't had any issues with it.",1
"Time is circular, not linear! If you have a touch of ADD, this calendar app may be useful in a variety of ways. I haven't replaced my other go-to task list calendar with this yet, but I may get really used to the functionality of it and do so. I have at least imported all my other calendar items into it, and I'm practicing with it for optimum utility. Great design!",1
"I've only had this app a few days but it has been helpful with keeping me on track with my schedule. I got the app because of the compatibility with Wear OS watches and for the most part, syncing changes in the app with my watch (Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic) have been pretty good except for a few things in the widget pallete settings for smartwatches. Changes I make to the color of the hour hand the the sector event arches don't update on my watch. Other than that, it's been good.",1
"I've always viewed time as a spiral, so this fits perfect to keep me visually organized. The app is very clever, fading out old events while revealing new ones for the next time around the face. Everything is customizable allowing you to make it look exactly like you need it. The only thing I want that would bump this to 5 stars is in app alarms. I don't like relying on the calendar's little one-time beeps. Allowing me to set an actual alarm I have to silence would be great.",1
"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.",1
"simplicity unmatched üôå, let's you focus on the tasks rather the app.",1
"I wish it included Tasks, but I just use more than one calendar to keep track of different types of events. It works great, it's so much easier to visualize the time -- I have focus issues and time blindness so it's been really helpful. I also really like the ability to map other apps to the widget buttons, so I can still open the clock for alarms from the homepage.",1
"I absolutely love this app. It is slightly confusing for a while and it takes a tiny bit to get used to, but once you learn what things fo it's really awesome. The only thing that confuses me to this day is the events shown ahead of time: they're automatically shown even if it's the next day. While it can be really useful to prepare yourself for said event, there's no option in the app to turn the feature off, customize it or a way to highlight the events of the one day you're looking at.",1
"Excellent and useful! I wish I had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too. Occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back. The outside clock face numbers are only black? Can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them. The widget palette is great, but I can imagine customization with background images of clock faces, different hand shapes, and/or color gradients to make it look really impressive!",1
"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",1
"good experience so far. Nicely synchronizes with Google calendar. It also keeps track of the alarms on my phone. Lots of options and customization. Only complaint is that the widget stops synching with the current time after a while, and you have to manually sync it by tapping the widget after you realize that the clock face isn't accurate. Kinda annoying when you want a quick look at the time and events but it shows the wrong thing.",1
"Very good app. It helps me tremendously with my ADHD time visualization problems (""time blindness""). One suggestion: make an option to use the watch face as a Tile and not just a watch face. I have another watchface that is much more useful to me for displaying fitness tracking information and app links, which I use too frequently to have to go into the app drawer every time. But if Spectrograph could be a Tile, I would be able to put it one swipe left or right from the watchface home.",1
I love this app and the way it displays my calendar!! I also absolutely love the Wear OS integration!! When I found out this can be a watch face I got a smart watch literally just for that!! One setting that's needed: It would be helpful if the day or multiple days long events can be hidden on the widget and watch face. Or a setting where it can be tucked inside the arcs/events diameter. Having a separate diameter specifically for day long events is nice but it makes the watch face smaller.,1
"I like the concept and the execution. Regretfully, I cannot use it. I use my calendar for events, reminders, and tasks, so it is very, very busy. I really wish it would work for me. Nicely done! Now if you could do that for a to-do list that would actually use the phone's audible alarms --- yes, that might hold my interest. It would need a couple different things than a calendar, but that might be a very nice adaptation of this app. Well done, good luck!",1
Love This. Very much helpful. A must have app for me in Phone and PC.,1
Best and simplest to-do list.,1
gooooooooooooooooood,1
"Please add custom template feature for repetitive , similar tasks. And 3 layer instead of 2 layer [task, step, micro step]",1
love this app üòç,1
so easy to use ! üíó,1
"Actually, works pretty well and intuitively!",1
"This app is amazing. I use it to show all my Google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock. I just have one feedback, I wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector, based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not. The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed. And thanks for this great app. Highly recommended.",1
"So far the app is working well. It took a little getting used to the creative and unique interface, but the demo is super helpful. I can tell much thought has gone into the development of this app. It's a pretty solid time management tool. UPDATE: minus one star due to the inability to customize snooze time.",1
Great help to remember work an personal admin,1
simply a great app!,1
I love this simple app. The online/offline sync function works well for me. What would make it better is adding a time recording for tasks.,1
very usefull,1
it's perfect üëå,1
"Very quick & nice 'n easy to use too, respectively. Anyway, please keep up the great work & hope we can come up w/ some more helpful ways to help people stay nice 'n organized. Beth Budner, Auburndale, MA!",1
Keeps my day moving in a positive direction. I end my day planning for the next. Today I was able to keep track of a busy travel/task list and I was able to follow though effectively and efficiently!,1

Excellent the best ever app,1
everything is good,1
"Thanks Microsoft , your sync saves lot of my time",1
love it.,1
I own multiple businesses and have had issues finding something that will help me keep order of my tasks without adding things to my calendar. This app has completely been a game changer. As I can add it to my home screen I can scroll through it any moment and just click once complete. Anyone that needs help with some organization this is the app for you.,1
"This is the best task list app out there. I have been using it for several years now. It has improved exponentially, especially since late 2018. It is much easier to add tasks with reminders and due dates with extra taps, share lists is great, I like grouping lists. We'll done, Microsoft.",1
When u add a task or something into a list it give many options on how to set it up. It let's set due dates and reminds u to do your task. And when you complete a task it make a little chime sound that makes you feel like you have accomplished something and makes you want to complete all your other tasks. Its just a good reminder app that makes you feel good.,1
"I never thought I'd turn to Microsoft for the optional task tracker but here I am! I used Any.Do for a weekly but it was ""too helpful"" and pushed me into a corner. Switched to Google Tasks which has nice integration with Gmail and Google calendar but was too simple for a power user. This app is just right. It does the simple things with ease, allows for ample customization, let's you set up your day like any.do without being too inflexible, and has decent cross platform integrations.",1
"I woke up this morning to this amazing app. Wow! This task reminder is totally radical dudes. I get some options to choose theme color time date and moreüòÄ I love the tropical theme for my reminders and ease of accessibility is straight forward. I'm experiencing more difficulty with talk back and buttons but I'm testing it all out so I can show my friends and family how to use it too. Great job Microsoft, you never miss a bullseye. I'm testing out voice reminder too.",1
"Excellent To Do List!! It can classify your tasks according to your needs (deadline, future plan, week plan, group assignment, individual assignment, etc), set due date and reminder, and even attach notes and files into a task! What I found most helpful is the app can break down a task into sub-tasks, and you can check each sub-task when you finish them! This always help me track each of my task so that I have a clear view of what to do. Thanks team :)",1
"I've been using handheld devices going back to before the smartphone (Palm Pilot, etc.). I have used Microsoft Outlook for ever and its my computer-based calendar., contacts, and email that I sync to my phone. However, as far as I know no one has ever able to sync Outlook Notes. Until this app came up with a solution. It's wonderful because I use Notes to keep track of so many things. Thanks!",1
"Best,simple,free",1
"It's really awesome, it's gives the best experience. How the day can be planned very productive.",1
It work really well for me.,1
Great use all the time,1

Good and functional. I wish they added multiple reminders like in Google Calendar. But let's wait for the updates,1
Efficiently organized and fast app.,1
nice app,1
very good app,1
With this app one can't forget anything! Simple tasks and daily chores that were awkward to add to the Outlook calendar are easily managed by this app along with complex tasks and events that integrate well with outlook calendar and OneNote. It keep synced with the desktop version and link well with win phone link. Incremental improvements makes it more productive. It's a must companion to MS Android Launcher. This app is useful to all users even those who are not working in MS ecosystem.,1
wow,1
Good app although I miss the old design of the background,1

I've just retired. It's great to keep me on top of my weekly tasks and garden & allotment reminders.,1
it really helps me to keep track of all the necessary tasks I need to complete throughout the day and helps me feel a bit more productive and fulfilled. Thank you for making this app for people like me :)),1
"I honestly really like the app. it's fast and it synchronizes pretty quickly across all of my devices, I don't actually have anything bad to say about the app.",1
"Add features like calendar view. Check the awsome app TimeTune that one is an ideal for calender and time boxing, you can add features like that and become the dominant app in the field.",1
"It is very user friendly and has so many options to personalize and seperate to do lists. Helps me keep track of everything from appointments and phone calls I need to make to grocery and shopping lists. The reminders are so helpful and it takes a lot off my plate by remembering things for me so I dont always have to. I recommend it to any busy body, working mom, or the people like me with severe A.D.D.",1
Works well with a Samsung Galaxy watch & business calendar 2. There is an issue if you have touch the screen enabled as it will turn completely white & you have to reset the watch face. In a more recent update the times between sectors will scale down to fit in the space if there's no room which is very cool. I got the premium version quite a while ago & am very happy. The thing I would like is if theres an option to have overlapping sectors fade into each other.,1
"very useful thank you I have adhd and rely on it quite a lot, wish we could ""save"" some events to re-use tho, so tasks we often have to do or routines dont take long to put up we can just select them",1
"Just downloaded. I wrote the descriptions of my tasks, but on the clock, they do not show up. Is there a way I could fix this. Now, there are no descriptions, just color if the time slot was taken.",1

Good app to track but needs improvements. 1. There's no shortcut to mark the task completed for the event 2. Tasks in calendar view doesn't show strike out which you see on day view 3. There should be notification/alarm sound or alert to dismiss for the reminders,1
"Almost perfect. However, I would hope that the center of the smartwatch could be customized to show, for example, daily steps instead of the time and date, and the ring to show the progress of the step goal instead of the battery charge status. Also, I still would like integration with google tasks,or that the sectograph would include its own task management.",1
VERY useful representation of my schedule for the day. Responsive and easy to use.,1
Great app. Would love if there was something similair for garmin watches.,1
Awesome way to look at the way you are going to spend your time.,1
"Great app , but doesn't sync with Samsung reminders even when the reminders sync automatically with the native calendar app",1
"Great app. I have one bug. If i remove the reminder from an event, i cant re add a reminder if i change my mind",1
Love it but it doesn't sync at all with Google calendar. Only does half of my events,1
Why isn't there a notification option?,1
trying it out. i like it so far. it would be even better if i could import a non google calender ics file...,1
Works well with a Samsung Galaxy watch & business calendar 2. There is an issue if you have touch the screen enabled as it will turn completely white & you have to reset the watch face. In a more recent update the times between sectors will scale down to fit in the space if there's no room which is very cool. I got the premium version quite a while ago & am very happy. The thing I would like is if theres an option to have overlapping sectors fade into each other.,1
Its a nice app to plan ur day! A little feature makes it even more beautifulüòÅ,1

Very good interface easy to navigate,1
"Awesome, but needs a setting for active hours. I want my watch to show a dial for only my selected active hours instead of the whole day so I can see what my work day looks like.",1
No google tasks... This is the only thing missing. Hard to truly pln my day without it.,1
"very useful thank you I have adhd and rely on it quite a lot, wish we could ""save"" some events to re-use tho, so tasks we often have to do or routines dont take long to put up we can just select them",1
"I love it but after a while off being disconnected from my phone I can't see my planning anymore, ducks because I often disconnect to save battery",1
Very good to visualise tasks. Better than any other task planner like Todolist etc which is very linear and hard to visualise,1
"Best scheduling app. Helped me kick procrastination. Had it installed in a previous phone and then didn't download it here, but now I just did.",1
Great idea. Really it's 4 1/2 stars. If this app would partner with an app like Business Calendar and become a fluid interaction / view to use with the regular calendar it would be phenomenal. The circular view and general functionality of the app are wonderful. Excellent work!!!,1
"While I haven't had it long, so far Sectograph is an excellent time management tool which, combined with calendars, allows daily or currently added items to be effectively managed with items scheduled well in the future. After more time to work with Sectograph, I'll modify my review if needed.",1
I started using this app in 11th std & I'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour. So I humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably.,1
It is a very good and simple app. UI is really excellent and using is so easy and enjoyable. I suppose 12 hours works well for me although I would prefer 24 free hours for sure. Still remains a question: how can alternate calendars (like persian calendar) be added to it?,1
"I think it's an excellent app, I bought the pro version asap. Cause I knew how good the app would be as a tool to improve my schedule and how I visualize it. BUT I DO HOPE THE DEV DOES add better visual features to sectors and transparency with regard to home screen widget. ‚ù§Ô∏è Edit : bad update, notification seems to have disappeared :( Edit2 : YES UPDATING HAS FIXED THE ISSUE THANKS DEV but I want more colorschemes for the sectograph as features ! Edit3 :updated again ! But add colorschemes to",1
"Just downloaded. I wrote the descriptions of my tasks, but on the clock, they do not show up. Is there a way I could fix this. Now, there are no descriptions, just color if the time slot was taken.",1
Good,1
Good,1
"Love the app, I wonder if there will be an option to use large ions in sectors as shown on app icon, rather than text? It would make the feel much more neat! Also,a good addition would be integragtion with reminding apps, e.g. samsung reminder.",1
The grapcana be better,1
"Made a Persona style day-part clock with this app, and it really has helped me stay on track. I have a fairly set schedule, so this is really helpful. I can imagine it being a bit more difficult to keep up with if you are constantly adding reminders to it, so I don't know if I could recommend it to someone who has a wild schedule.",1
"I used to be able to at least turn reminders on even if they never made any sounds, but now the button's not doing anything at all, it's practically part of the background for all it's doing. Please fix this?",1
"The Most Brilliant App I ever Used,No others words it.I bought pro. I need more colours for events+ add colour palette+colour saver option",1
"It works great! Was initially having trouble getting Google calendar subscriptions to sync but resetting the sync in Google account settings worked! Hopefully we see tasks getting added in the future. Less 1 star, just cos the date/time is kinda tiny but I understand why. Would be nice to be able to customize that.",1
please upload some screenshots of pro version. would be helpful before buying,1
nice APP and1 purchased it. But i could not find my date of parchase I don't see any account section from which i can get my google account info,1
I just wish I could set a different notification when I get notified from Sectograph. Why can't I do it?,1
"Loving this app, the visual actually helped me to manage my time so much better. The only minus of this app is when I wanted to add activities while on landscape mode, it was still on portrait's mode (I'm using tablet). It inconvenienced me having to rotate my tab to portrait to type and add details, then rotate it back to landscape. Especially when I have many activities to add.",1
Provide screenshots for the pro features. Then I am in.,1
Love this app make it better support Samsung phones and watches it doesn't work properly on my z-fold 5 when it is unfolded,1
Overall great but could be better? Great way to display the data as a watchface. I do wish that once I change the color for a recurring event that the app would remember it. I like having the tile version as well when I want to change the watch face to something else.,1
"This helps me to stick to my routine mor than a calendar, it is user friendly by use this regular you can keep improving your time management skills,and you also get confidence of going in correct path makes you motivated and relaxed.",1
"Great design, I've enjoyed using the app without problems...",1
"This app is (nearly) perfect for my pixel watch. Unfortunately the display is a bit crowded for such a small screen, and one or two of the watch options (like removing the arcs between diary entries) don't seem to work. I'd love it if clicking on an event for details could also show the location - that would stop me having to pull my phone out of my pocket every second appointnent. Still using it all the time as a satisfied paying customer",1
"I love this app, it helps me organize my events easily and efficiently. The only thing that is annoying, is that i can't change the app coloring. Blue is good and all, but it is distracting. I'd prefer to be able to customize at least the coloring.",1
Very pleased üòÑ,1
Please add the first day as Saturday,1
"It's almost perfect. But if the developer insert some sounds it will more effective as a reminder. Because sometimes in a hectic situatioan, I personally forget to open the apps. And better if this app can be a default calendar also. So all the setting from google or default calendar can well synchronously.",1
Bit long winded to set up as every element can be changed. But love it.,1
Informative,1
Nice and aesthetic and simple app..good if you don't like much of distraction...,1
pros ‚Ä¢ works cons ‚Ä¢ it doesn't reflect g cal colors ‚Ä¢ time to time high CPU so app is shutdown by OS,1
Honestly surprised more people aren't using this. It makes it so much easier to see my tasks and schedule my day.,1
Great way to organise your day. Really helped me to visually see how my day will work.,1
Lovely Best Time management,1
"Did it got and update?? The seconds dial got shrunk down, it doesn't fit the whole watch face anymore it looks ugly now! Please fix it, I hope it's just a bug Samsung Galaxy watch 5, 44mm",1
Works well with my GW4. Helped loads with my procastination.,1
Seeing tasks in a 'wheel of time' as well as your progress; very helpful!!,1
I love this app but the widget resizes itself all the time so will not give it five stars until that is fixed. I am using Nova Launcher and no other widget behaves this way.,1
Pretty lit,1
Time does not update everytime. Shows wrong time. This is frustrating,1
Very good to visualise tasks. Better than any other task planner like Todolist etc which is very linear and hard to visualise,1
My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options üòä,1
Like that it's linked to my google calendar and that there are different views - as the different views make planning a lot easier. There are times when I can't edit events for some reason and that can be a little confusing but overall I like the interface.,1
"It was good, until I changed my phone to S20 FE exynos (android 11 one ui 3.0). Widget clock is often not updated (time freeze) although I've put this app in ""never sleeping"" option in battery setting. I even locked the app in recent apps so the OS didn't kill BG task, but still to no avail. Sometimes it even went missing despite being locked in recent apps. In rare case the widget clock did get updated w/out problem. I think it's samsung's fault in optimization, but is there no solution by dev?",1
"I don't usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great. It really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when I open to my home screen. My only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that, it's pretty great. Most planner apps don't work but this blew it out of the park",1
"EDITED - read second paragraph. Hi, not sure if I'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day. It makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face, but the list of events should include all tasks of the day -- instead of us having to ""fast forward"" the day until the events appear. I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though.",1
Its a nice app to plan ur day! A little feature makes it even more beautifulüòÅ,1
"I've not been using the app for long, but it's potential is intriguing.",1
"All ima say this, this is a game changer! Yet another simple app my heart been yearning for. Visually something that works for me. It's simple. Literally took me just once to go through demo to know what goes for what. All thing I wish for as an extra thing is a pc version that sync with app. But right now that not a biggy. Thank you for making this app possible! (happy customer)",1
Useful but still needs more integration to Outlook ... I'd like to load my colour categories that I already have in outlook calendar in my visualization. Calendar by week numbers is also a must have ... I'd like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events. It could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time I wake up ... and so on. The potential of this app is huge,1
"Quite useful little widget. I only wish I had control over which calendar it used. it seems to only pick up the Google/Samsung and I would like to use the widget for my repetitive schedule AND a second widget for my daily planner. There is the ability to select which calendar within the Google app I want to use, but that just makes the calendar side messy. Two separate app calendar selection would solve this for me, unless anyone has a better idea how I can get around this? Still, thank you dev",1
"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",1
Very good interface easy to navigate,1
"This could literally be everything I need if you added ONE more feature: a categorical checklists panel. A page I can colourfully list and check-off my home priorities, separate from work priorities, and document my impulsive ideas as distractions to set them aside. I'm still using Trello cards to do this, but I feel this need only be a small feature to track that I'm not extending too much or following too many impulses.",1
A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45¬∞ looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.,1
"Great way to visualise my day and keep time. Improvement suggestion: Make it possible to choose between adding events connected to the calendar, and adding events in the app separate to the calendar. I need to add things to the app that I want to keep separate from my calendar otherwise the calendar has an overwhelming amount of routine things to look at at a glance, rather than being able to view my calendar and see important events.",1
Amazing app with Smartwatch face functionality. This app is even the reason for buying a smartwatch! Only wish I could change the transparency level of the sectors for the monochrome mode. Or the option for having colors with the always on display would be nice. But defenitly want the setting to increase the transparency so it's not so bright in monochrome mode draining the watch battery.,1
"I really love this app for so many reasons. Above all it's keeps me organized and punctual. What I wish I could change, or maybe I can and just can figure out how, is how to make the widget color pallet settings the same on my OS Wear. thats why I bought the extra options innthe first place. My watch face doesnt even look like it does in the photos. Can I change this!?",1
"With a little setup effort, I now have a widget on my screen which tells me where I am in my time blocking for the day at any given point. I wish there was more customisation for the widget eg adjusting the range of viewable time, making it more aesthetically pleasing beyond just colours. There's lots of options but not the ones I was looking for primarily. Still, it works.",1
"I think it's by far one of the best apps out there. It integrates well with the default calendar app, and really helps you to track your day. Tons of customizable buttons, and even the clock face itself from the hour/minute arms colour and thickness/length, to the placement of the numbers on the clockface. I love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting, task or alarm. Widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen. Lock Screen display??",1
Love this app! I have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in Google calendar and other organisational apps. My only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment (events) and the option to link a segment to a checklist. I have found a way to do this but it means I need to use a URL link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up.,1
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance.",1
"I actually do love the app, the layout, the functionality. However it did take about 10 minutes of trial and error to become familiar with the settings for the graph itself. Displaying the settings as they would directly correspond to the setup, or with an image sample would help tremendously. Hopefully no one misses out on such a great product because understanding it took some more effort.",1
"Made outlook play nicely by just importing my outlook calendars to google calendar. so that was pretty easy really.  I love the widget on my phone, it looks good, works nicely, it's awesome. The phone-clockface however can't be configured I can't find any option to add my business-calendar and some shared calendars to the clock face, it seems to only show my primary calendar (which apart from my own birthday is completely emtpy). (I'm aware that on Android one can select calendars, they just don't reflect over to the android watchface)",1
"Really love the app. Helps me organize my time and schedule. If you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector, and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better. Setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded, and with some of the hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) not shown kinda bothers me. Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed. Overall, great app!",1
"I REALLY like the idea of this app, so much so, that I paid for the premium version. However, on my Samsung Watch, it did start off showing the different entries from my calendars, but has now stopped and it nothing more than a standard watch face. I've not changed any settings (have you?). Any advice on why this is the case please, coz I REALLY want to give you 6 stars (out of 5!!).",1
I absolutely love this visualisation for my watch and phone home screen - I'm ADHD and struggle with keeping track of time but this is super helpful to make sense of how long things are. The only thing I dislike is that it's almost TOO customisable. I would love to be able to just select from a small list of pre-set themes. Trying to change every single colour for every single item so that it looks nice and coherent is a bit of a pain. I still love it and I regularly recommend it to people!,1
"Loving this app, the visual actually helped me to manage my time so much better. The only minus of this app is when I wanted to add activities while on landscape mode, it was still on portrait's mode (I'm using tablet).

"Do you have plans to support Office 365 and outlook calendars directly.   Currently, I am syncing my calendars to Google but it's not a pleasant experience as the sync keeps failing on one or other calendar.    Due to this reason, I am stopping sectograph and moving to outlook widget :-(  For those who are on google calendar, it's an excellent app and the developer support is awesome.   I'm rating 4 only for the dependency on google calendar.",1
"Had written a bad review because I spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars. Couldn't do it (and wasted hours!) until I noticed a nearly invisible dot (at least on my screen, I'm using the iblue app) near the widgets. Pressed it and discovered the widget menu! They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it.",1
"I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors.",1
"I like and rate this app, as a replacement for the sadly now defunct 12 Hours, but there are some things that should be improved, including the seeming inability to sync with my google calendar on my Sony Xperia 1iii. This is despite paying the somewhat high purchase fee.",1
"Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!",1
"I am using the paid version. The overall interface of the app is great. But there is a glitch with the upcoming alarm feature It never shows the upcoming alarm correctly. If that is fixed, It would be great.",1
"Very cool and very helpful app. Looking forward to the repository and event editor update. And while I liked using Google Calendar, modifying and integrating all those features for Sectograph use will be very convenient. There are times when the time on the widget doesn't update and match my current time. I'd have to open the app and close to refresh. Maybe you could also add a 24-hour clock view. Would be nice to not have to spin the thingy if I just want to see my activities 12 hours later.",1
"Love this but new widget please? I've been using this app for organisation for the past few months and it's remarkably good at organising your life but my only request is that you add a widget similar to Google Calendar Day View where I can easily see what I've got to do next throughout the day, the sectograph is too visually confusing for me especially because my day is often jam packed with things to do. Thank you and keep up the good work!!!",1
Uodated: I've gotten a new watch so I'm able to see it now. However I doesn't sync the color palette with what I set on the phone app for my watch. So the face colors are plain. I love this widget!! It's such a clear picture of the time and schedule!! My only thing is I wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch! I got the app because I saw it on the watch I'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch. üòï If this was improved to work with the watch I would give it 5++ stars.,1
"I've been using this app and the watch face on my Moto 360 for close to about a year now. With all my events for the day (and the next day) visible on my wrist, I can keep track of my calendar easily. However recently, the watch face is defaulting to 'Simple Clock' (default watch face) whenever I use the watch. It only affects Sectograph and it has been bugging me since.",1
"Im a visual person, so this helps me so much throughout my day. A feature request I have is to please allow the ability to use complications. This enables me to use my notifications directly on the face of my watch and it would be great to have the middle area show me when my washer/dryer is done lol",1
"Awesome new idea for a productivity widget. Significantly more useful than a calendar or list of upcoming events. the one thing I would like to change would be the display of numbers on arcs. It looks kind of silly near the center of the circle when the numbers twist and overlap. Change that, 5 stars.",1
"Great app! It is working very well for our family in planning our days! Would like for it to fully interface with my calendar though - so I could edit from Sectograph as well. Otherwise, I think it is an excellent way to spatially visualize time management.",1
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!,1
"I like it a lot until you have overlapping times for your schedule or events.... It's too hard to tell which one you are looking at cuz it only shows one. Unless you touch it or open it but that defeats the purpose of it, it's for a quick glance. Fix that n ur golden.",1
"It works great! Was initially having trouble getting Google calendar subscriptions to sync but resetting the sync in Google account settings worked! Hopefully we see tasks getting added in the future. Less 1 star, just cos the date/time is kinda tiny but I understand why. Would be nice to be able to customize that.",1
"Effective, but the widget should open the app. I have the widget on one of my screens and it's frustrating that it doesn't open the app unless you tap on a scheduled event... And then it opens THAT event for editing. Tapping center of the clock face should bring up the app for entering a new event.",1
"It's good at what it is, which is a cool, useful interface to an existing Google or Microsoft calendar. But it is not a stand alone calendar. So if you use or want to use one of the calendars it supports then it's great, otherwise not so much.",1
"I wanna love it but there is no way of adding times directly in the app, you have to go through Google Calendars no matter what :/ Edit: Up to four stars because dev showed a way to manage external calendars within the app, which means I can now make it work for my needs! Unfortunately though I still need to grant device calendar permission which means I can't use this app as a fully isolated platform. Instant five stars if that was possible!",1
"Very close to being 5 stars. There are just a few oddities in the user interface (and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing) who means that for some the word ""buggy"" might be applied. I'm more inclined to say ""unpolished"" in certain areas... But a great app none the less",1
"It is awesome on the mobile(widget)as it has number of ways to interact and view events It's a bare minimum on SMART WATCH just displays the widget(mobile) Improvement(ADD FEATURES)to be done in SMART WATCH section 1. Discription of events when pressed on the event segment(same as mobile widget) 2. Open canlender when pressed on watch face 3. Add event from watch 4. Atleast special few customisable option for PREMIUM Users like watch (like add steps,heart rate....etc and MORE).",1
"Very cool idea and well implemented, the only thing I wish it had was a tile for WearOS. As it stands the only way to use it on my galaxy watch is to replace my watch face which I don't really want to do. I'd much rather have a tile I could scroll to whenever I want. If the devs could implement that then it's an easy 5 stars.",1
"Love the app, I only hope they will add syncing with Samsung Reminder and also add Reminder feature within the app and be able to add stickers or smilies on the event or reminder so we can check it visually instead of reading them if we forgot also I hope they add a count down and passed period of time by (days/months/year and time) to events .. Other than that, the app is perfect and satisfying to use which will motivate to diligence‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Been using this app for a short while. So far so good. It's purely a visual of events, time, and alarms, while all the actual event management still happens through the Google Calendar app, and which I think is brilliant. Still figuring out the app.... Like how does one track time on it? ü§î",1
It's a beautiful app one of or the best for time management but one thing is lacking.no tracker to show how much effort has been put on a habit over time. Like a chart or graphic report to show how much work One has put into an activity over a period of time.i don't know how best to explain it but if the developers can research other apps you would see what am talking about.if that is added this app would be perfect 100%till them I would keep one üåü for myself ü§™,1
No google tasks... This is the only thing missing. Hard to truly pln my day without it.,1
"Great app so far, however it's missing one of the key functionalities I'm using Google calendar for, which is starting Navigation to the address of the event when clicked upon the icon. Right now the icon has no functionality and I can't find this functionality otherwise. This is currently keeping me from buying the app since I still need my other calendar.",1
"I really love the app before especially the widget because I can easily add one and know what should I do in the home. However, after many years of using it, I started to get annoyed by the widget due to some errors regarding on how I designed it the way I wanted particularly the the color themes. Hope it will be fixed.",1
"I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more.",1
"Loving this app and widget! Just purchased premium, but one thing that seems to be missing is automatically colouring Calendar items based on different calendars? I seem to be able to manually change the colour but this app would be perfect if there's a way to automate that. I have work and personal calendars that are coloured differently on Google Calendar but not on this app or widget.",1
"I really liked the concept of the diagram as that's exactly what I was looking for. The only drawback for me is that it takes the events from the settings/android calendar, which is not what I wanted. I would prefer to set events in the app straightaway. I will download it again if this feature becomes available in the future. :)",1
It is a useful app because the reminders and pictoral representation help me track my time usage which enhances my productivity. Although one has to manually input ones daily activities which can be useful for a user with dynamic activity not for a routine one. An auto refill typing or a predictive tying might be somewhat a middle course for both users. Thank you,1
"I've had for a few days now and I really enjoy it, however sometimes the clock on the widget won't show the actual time unless I go in the app and then leave to update it, I thought it might be I had bad internet connection but it still doesn't work with a stable network. That's the only issue I have with it, because when you're running late and you see two different times on the clock and the widget with almost an hour of difference you can get confused.",1
"This app has made my planning so much easier! I like to plan my meals ahead of time and with this i can put LASAGNA for example and then add ground meat, cheese, lasagna pasta as ""steps"" so that I'm able to mark off each ingredients as I've purchased them! It allows me to collect my tasks into specific categories and I always recommend this app to my clients :) I am a professional organizer and if you have Microsoft, MICROSOFT TO DO is an essential part to organizing your life.",1
"SUCH a good app, very organized, ability to create lists within groups/categories, add sub-steps to each task, due dates, reminders, notifications you can't just swipe away, etc. A lot of thought has clearly gone into this app, and I sincerely appreciate it! The only feature I'd like is to see all my tasks in ""all tasks,"" regardless of whether they're assigned to a list or not; I personally like seeing a bird's eye view of everything I need to do. Keep up the good work Microsoft!!",1
"Best to do list and tracking application out there! Microsoft knocked it out of the park with this one - excellent UI, useful features, and a well defined organizational structure for sorting, searching, and indexing all of my lists. I especially enjoy the ability to create sub points for a list item for a more granular breakdown of your tasks. It's great!",1
Good,1
simple and good,1
Excellent..,1
"can't find a search function, otherwise 5 stars",1
"This is the best free task and project app that I found. used to use Wunderlist which this was based off of, but their first versions had few features. They really did a great job of rounding this out. I do wish that it had a tag or category feature. I was using Outlook for my email for a while but decided to go back to Gmail. That has made turning emails into tasks look more complicated. But this is much better than Google's task app, so I stayed with it.",1
its simple to use.,1
"Great app and good syncing with outlook. However, sometimes sync with desktop is not good. Also, a feature request - ability to add numbers for importance in the task in my day",1
"Very useful. Great GUI, once you learn to use it.",1

if you add voice recording it will be very uselful,1
"Need to fix some bugs with synchronisation between mobileapp and webapp, but definitely a great tool",1
Nice,1
good but need improvement üòÑ,1
action taken rows against each task/sub task with date entry provision would make this app perfect.,1
I'm using Microsoft To Do App as my default To Do app. Easy to use with great features,1
Good one. Thanks to Microsoft,1
"Could I make a recommendation? I use this daily for work, currently would love a to do list I could share that somatoform resets daily, want to have daily tasks for each area in the workplace so staff can check items one complete then come in the following day to a reset checklist. Hoping to have a daily and weekly task list to share around as a visual reminder",1
"Its the best except for 1 thing I Need to be able to set the time when each task appears throughout the day, i dont want everything to appears the same time",1
"I think the list emoji options are extremely limited. I once had a list for shopping and had a shopping cart as the icon emoji. after I deleted the list to start a new fresh list, the emoji shopping cart is no longer available. very limited on what emoji you can use to highlight or customize your list.",1
"Hi Microsoft team, I want to give my suggestion 1. adding a new feature of voice notes or voice tasks to the app that will make it easier to add tasks and manage them 2. There should be option of some sort of time counting that will show how much time he has consumed on that task 3. Option of repeat tasks",1
"i hope there's a separated catergory inside the app for tasks that you have missed so that the notification could be cleared from the old ones and only have the tasks due for today. the way it should be a reminder, it became one of the ""background notifications"" among the others so it usually being ignored.",1
"Nice little app. Syncs well with desktop. I would like to see the ability to sort items by time as well as date, or at least some way to order them within the same day.",1
It would be great if the app could also provide a sub-tasks feature. Where a major task can be broken down into smaller ones over separate dates to mark the progress.,1
"nice app, I wish you could customize your lists a bit better though in terms of background and color code. but otherwise it's just a regular app that syncs your todo lists across your devices",1
"While adding tasks in my day panel, the plus button should also search existing tasks in various lists which gives the option to add tasks directly from the already made lists. It would give us option to add new task in a list if we want or to select already existing tasks in list. Now what we have to do is go out of my day panel, Search for the task, open it and then add it to my day - long process which can be made more fluid as above.",1
"This ap is a lifesaver! The only thing that would make it perfect is being able to have a task recurring before the due date, as a reminder to work on it each day/week. once the due date is put in, it doesn't show up in your list until it's due.",1
"It would be nice if there were goals that the tasks could be related to. I don't need the business version of 365 just yet, so buying it just to get planner is not in the cards right now. So, having a way in todo to connect my tasks to my goals would be nice. That being said the app works well.",1
One of the best to do list app Add priorities to task,1
My laptop sometimes doesn't sync with my phone,1
good really help me,1
It would be great if the app could also provide a sub-tasks feature. Where a major task can be broken down into smaller ones over separate dates to mark the progress.,1
good,1
"Handy but it's weird that you get one notification for the task, and another that there are tasks due. Seems redundant.",1
does what you expect it to,1
Seems OK. Early days yet so will let you know.,1
Enhanced it and give it more teamwork feature,1
"Great app, but id like to have it on my watch as well",1
"Love this app. It helps me organize my life, both at home and at work. I only have one suggestion. I live entirely in the Planned section and wish I could reorder the items within the list for a day. For now, I have to use numbers or exclamation points to cause items to sort at the top.",1
"Mostly great, but unable to recover deleted items. If you accidentally delete a task or entire list, it's effectively irrecoverable. The standing advice from Microsoft is to go into your Outlook (???) and restore the items in your Deleted Items folder. However, only a subset of what I deleted was there and restoring had no effect in the To-Do app. Pretty silly data handling. The other features in the app are good and offer more organizational tools than other task lists at least.",1
simple and effective,1
good üëçüòä specially the planned list I like it,1
The app is good overall. The only issue I face is that the widget on homescreen gets stuck often. Please try and fix that,1
"I use this app for personal reminders and my wife and I share it for a grocery list. The only improvement I would add would be an ""undo last"" option, as sometimes I hit the complete circle by mistake and then panic as the reminder has disappeared and it is very difficult to find out what it even was.",1
overall good and when opening the app take some time or slow to open,1
some fuctionalities missing. templates and then som general ui stuff just a bit off. but great overall,1

A very good app. if they add a calender view and subtask feature in adding tasks it will be best,1

"The app is absolutely great! It helps me keep my activities on track and set reminders. I would have given a 5 star but it has a slight bug - when I set a customised background, it goes blank after a couple of days. It's really annoying, I downloaded this app because it allowed me to customise my wallpaper but this bug is just defeating the purpose.",1
would be nice if it outlook calendar would sync with To Do.,1
I rarely gove 5 points.,1

Sometimes tasks are not displayed,1
Great experience ‚ù§Ô∏è & a tip add notes option,1

Love the simplicity.,1

"I liked Wunderlist much better. It was easier to use, and more streamlined. Microsoft bought it and turned it into this To Do app, and dropped some features, and changed others, and it's not the help to me that it once was. The only reason that they would do that, in my opinion, is that they didn't like having competition, especially when it was better than what they offered. So, IMHO, they bought it and changed it into this mediocre app that has their name on it. Disappointing.",1
"I have only had this app for a few days. The more I search for solutions the more I find. This is a great app, but it needs a way to give each task a sortable priority number. I love the My Day page which gives me the most important subset of all my tasks. I never put more than 5 things there. If I complete them before the end of the day, I add more. One of my favorite features is the ability to hide completed tasks. The biggest fault is I haven't found a tutorial for all the features.",1
"I love it, i use it to help me remember small tasks I need for school and grabing stuff at the store. My only downside is I wish there where more complex customization. Like putting a downloaded pic into the background instead of the small selection they have. Or a way for it to refresh the tasks in the entire list, instead of going through all of them and setting times to remind you.",1
"Best ToDoList app I've seen, in fact, this is the only Microsoft app I enjoy using (for the most part.) However, the reminders portion could use some work. The main problem with reminders is: it doesn't give you any indication of whether you set it at 8AM or 8PM! AM/PM is non-existent, only ""8:00."" So, if you set a reminder for ""8:00,"" you won't know if it'll remind you at 8AM or 8PM! Please fix this, as it's very confusing.",1
"Excellent to-do list application. Syncs reliably and allows me to add and check off tasks from my phone or my computer easily. The only feature lacking is the ability to assign a time of day, not just a due date, to a task. Sometimes I have tasks that need to be done by a certain time (e.g. online assignments) and it would help if they could be organized automatically in order of time of day they are due on a particular day. Other than that, no complaints at all! 10/10 would recommend.",1
"Update: Developer responded and fixed the issue. Pretty sad they don't QA their updates for issues like this Original Review (2 stars): I used to enjoy this app a lot. Now, every damn update turns back on the ""auto suggestion"" feature which I have to turn off for EVERY LIST EVERY TIME. This is out of control. I will be searching for a new to do list app that actually remembers my preferences. Really ridiculous that this is an ongoing issue.",1
"I came from Wunderlist and was skeptical, but I have really enjoyed this app so far, the only improvement that I would like to see is that when you show completed that the items be in order of how you completed them with the most recent on top. There doesn't seem to be any order to it at this point. Also, there doesn't seem to be any settings to adjust this.",1
"My favorite app! I use this to help me remember EVERYTHING I need to do. Unfortunately, though, the most recent update has caused the notifications to come through blank. It used to tell me what my task was in the notification but now I have to go into the app to see what the task is. Kind of annoying. Can this be fixed? I can send you screenshots if you want to see what I'm seeing.",1
"So far, I really like the app and how fast everything updates between my different devices. I would really like it if the widget would show the scheduled due date next to the task. Also, it would be nice if scheduled tasks would show in the My Day screen for that day automatically instead of manually placing them there. The custom repeat option for monthly should also give you the option of either date or day of week. Other than that, it's pretty good.",1
"Update: from 1 star to 4 stars. One more thing in my book that needs to be fixed, it's gotta play nice with Google calendar. I would like to see things due on my calendar. üëçüèº Thank you for updating. Doing good. Original post : ARG!!!! I'm sooooo annoyed with this app! Clicking the star should throw the item to the top of the list! Adding items should be added to the TOP of the list! FIX THIS APP PLEASE!!! üôèüèº",1
"It is great, unlike others: items in list can be checked off or deleted. google app ""TASKS"" only allows list items to deleted. A feature to group a list of items does NOT WORK. The group can be created but no list can be assigned by ""tap or drag"" list. no list are presented, the android Galaxy note 20 screen just flashes!! I like the interface and will contine to use it tilll MS fixes this bug.",1
"So, this is generally a great app, however there is room for improvement. Within app, you cant search any one specific list or list grouping. You have to back out to the main dashboard to be able to search, which searches within all lists. Unlike other similar apps, you can only have a bulleted list. I would love the addition of the option to also create notes vs. only lists. Also has great reminder features for one time and recurring reminders.",1
Fantastic task list. They took the best of Wunderlist and improved on it. The only thing I'd like to see is a change in the default reschedule options. It always provided the same options that I really use. I'd love it to earn from my previous rescheduling. It would save a lot of clicks.,1
"The app does not have the same features like Microsoft Outlook tasks does. Setting due dates and reminders takes a few extra steps, like selecting 'Add to today' for the task to show on the day's agenda. Also, the app does not sort by due date past 'tomorrow'. On the plus side, it does include flagged emails which is very useful.",1
"I like using this app. It helps me keep track of longer term goals. BUT... I HATE this new look. No need for it. I liked it the way it was. Stick to keeping it bug free, don't mess with the interface. Want the plain white background back and the colored band just at the top.",1
"Would love to be able to sync to the calendar and pre-configure my day ahead of time. Other than that, I love the app and how it connects/syncs to the computer. It has helped me immensely in keeping track of my life, making sure I don't leave anything behind. I really appreciate being able to add quick tasks and being able to set reminders for myself.",1
"This app is great but is missing some user experience features that I feel would make it a lot better. I love this app because it integrates so well with the Microsoft launcher. I really liked the old Google now and Microsoft launcher has something that I feel is fairly close to that with its at a glance screen. This app powers the tasks list that goes on that screen and it would be nice if it was just a little more user-friendly, such as automatically adding new tasks for my day.",1
"Never thought the day would come where I would say Microsoft To Do is the best task app. PROS: PINNED REMINDERS, shared links work flawlessly, my day, excellent email integration if you use Outlook, less glitches compared to Todoist and Any Do. CONS: no secondary label management, no way to move an open task to another list, Smart dates do not work on Android, reminders do not have a reschedule option. BOTTOM LINE: If reminders are the most important feature for you than look no further.",1
"After using the now defunct wunderlist for quite some time, I was curious to see if another app could work as well. ""To Do"" has pleasantly surprised me. If I could change anything it would be to have more options when comes to arranging items within a list. I'd love to be able to arrange completed items one way, and the uncompleted items another way.",1
"I really like the ""skip to current task"" option in the app and some of the more recent updates like customizable background images. So far, this app is the one that works the best for me overall because I don't necessarily want detailed tracking stats. I just usually want to know what's next and have somewhere to store undated to-do items too, and it's convenient because I use Microsoft Office products on PC. I also like using just one app for to-do errands AND household chores.",1
"As is typical for Microsoft, they took over a wonderful app in Wunderlist, screw it up, and jam it down the throat of their customers. The MS To Do List is harder to use than Wunderlist and lost some features that made it convenient to manage your tasks. I am convinced MS programmers must never use their own products. Follow up: I am glad Microsoft listened to its users. They actually emailed me back and fixed some of the issues that I and others have complained. Now I am using To Do and happy.",1
"I love this so far and I am recommending it above Google Keep, which has been my go to previously. I have been trying more Microsoft products since switching to Office365 for work. please add the following features for a five star review: -annual reoccurrence of tasks (up to monthly is available) -import via Excel list or similar, ideally with multiple fields (such as deadline) -cross functional with OneNote",1
"This is a useful app. My wife and I use this to track things we do both individually and together. One shared use is a grocery list. Whenever I find myself making an unplanned stop at a store, I text her and say, ""At grocery store. Need anything? Update grocery list."" She adds things using the app on her phone and, because that list is shared, they show up on mine. One thing I don't like is that search only works from the top level. I want to be able to search within a list as well.",1
"The app itself is good for computer. For the phone is too much space and too much battery waisted. I wish, that this app will have phone compatible app, that can connect to the computer, without making battery crazy. I uninstalled it from my phone because it takes too much battery, and continue to use it in computer standard. Thank you.",1
"I love this app, so far. I use it for my shopping lists, to do lists, scheduling, and other organizational needs. I am pleased that I can sync with my email, other devices, and calendar. I would love to be able to give it a full five üåü, but I can't. There's no way to delete a list that's been copied to another heading without deleting that list as well. List also sync up, apparently. Also, once a list is deleted, there's no way to bring it back; it's gone forever. Otherwise, great app!",1
"Needs one thing that Wunderlist had: Grouping! As someone with clients, I want to group clients under a label or folder (or similar) structure. For instance, say I have clients for Web Design and for Video Production‚ÄîI'd like to group the clients for each service (in my case) under a collapsible label/folder to make sifting through client tasks a bit less cumbersome (for real, I have a list for each client and am at around 50 client lists so far...it's a lot to sift through as a straight top-down list in the navigation pane). Also, the ability to manage/be logged into more than 1 account would be great in instances where I use To Do for business but also when I use it for personal tasks shared with my significant other. Please consider!",1
Very nice app. Almost as good as Apple üòÅ. Would be nice if I could schedule task on calendar. But great that I can have on phone and laptop. Dumped other apps that do more for this simple straight forward app that allows me to capture stream of consciousness things I need to do like reschedule doctor apt. Got rid of paper tablet on my desk in favor of this.,1
"I converted from Wunderlist to the Microsoft To Do and the transition has been quite easy. I really loved Wunderlist, but this app mirrors many of the functions, and particularly the ones I use most, for lists and list sharing. The performance has been consistent and easy to use. I'm very glad the Wunderlist/ now Microsoft team was able to model To Do as closely as possible to the excellent Wunderlist app, plus add some new features. I definitely recommend it. Thanks for all your hard work. PG",1
"Update 02/08/2022: Still use the app every day and love it. There seems to be a bug that crept in during one of the updates. If I go back into a note that I previously created within a task, it becomes almost impossible to edit that note. The screen starts adding blank lines. As this happens, I can no longer see the text from my note (it has moved up...the app is automatically adding returns). A wonderful, uncluttered app to remind me of things I want to get done; today, tomorrow or next month.",1
"I really like this app. It's great for helping me to stay organized. My only complaint is that quite frequently, the alarm doesn't remind me when it's supposed to (my 6:45 task reminder sometimes doesn't alert me until 6:50 or 7 or sometimes not at all). Hopefully this will get fixed soon. Otherwise, it is a great app.",1
I use it for my grocery list. Now the completed items are moved to the bottom. I kind of like that except for the order the completed items are in. I need them to stay in alphabetical order so I can easily find items. It's so aggrevating to skim back and forth looking for something that I need to uncheck. Please fix! Update: They fixed the sort for completed tasks. Very nice now. Thank you!,1
"So far it has been everything that I have been wanting in a to-do list. I have had a few issues with it saying there have been some activities that have breached the user agreement (I barely used it two days) and it blocked my account for about 24 hours. But other than that, it has been wonderful so far. Very easy to use and add whatever you want and what I really like is reminders! It actually works when you ask to be reminded of a task or bunch of tasks. Very happy with app, for now.",1
"One critcism: To-Do doesn't inherently have a recycling bin. Once you delete a task or list, the only way to restore it is apparently through Outlook, but I couldn't get that to work. Pretty big flaw imo. Otherwise, a very tidy and useful app with most features that I need, including sub-tasks, tags, and a widget.",1
"Update 10.13.2021: 2 more stars earned. The app has improved a great deal. Original review: I might go a day or more with no notifications coming through before I notice, then begrudgingly sign out, force stop, clear cache and storage before re-signing in and just hoping it works. Problem is, a test task doesn't solve the problem; have to wait for an old task to run to actually see.",1
"PLEASE add the option of adding tasks to the top instead of forcing them to the bottom. That's the only thing stopping me from using the app. Edit: I just heard you're killing off Wunderlist for good in May of 2020. I know I'm just one person, but I'll be jumping ship if such a simple improvement isn't made. Edit again: 3/27, and you did an update. But why in the world would you give iOS the ""add tasks to the top"" feature but NOT Android? Come on, please?? Edit 4/15: You did it. THANK YOU!",1
"Good basic list maker. There were many updates made since its inception and I look forward to what lies ahead. It is missing the ability to organize your lists and folders alphabetically. Also it's odd that when I'm moving a list, it gives me all the other lists instead of the folder. I'm sure this will be corrected soon.",1
"Generally, I enjoy this app. I used Wunderlist before it was bought by MS and rolled into To Do. The main complaint I have is that when you mark an item as ""Important"" it puts it into a single database with all of the other items from the other categories that are also marked as Important. With Wunderlist, you could have a separate ""important"" list for each category. Now, it just dumps all of the important items into one list which is really annoying because it seems like a simple fix.",1
"Really helps manage whats important. Im able to see items stared, flagged and with due dates easily and intuitevely from my complex, and extensive files in tasks and emails. I can manage them from my phone or computer and integrates well with Outlook . My only wish is to be able to schedule any of these items with a right click send to calendar feature to support scheduling the day / week and hours to be devoted.",1
"This app is just what I needed in my life! I tend to make many lists and they eventually become disorganized or revisited months later. To Do helps me quickly jot things down, keep me organized, and include other snippets of info like deadlines, notes, etc. I agree with others that I would love to have text formatting or bullets options.",1
"Great app, just recently started using it. One suggestion please, on the widget for the homescreen, is it possible to give us the option to choose whether to always SHOW any tasks we've created all the time UNTIL the day of its completion and then it disappears, OR, the task stays hidden in that widget UNTIL its due date and then it appears in the widget. I create some tasks on the daily as a reminder and I also have a weekly reminder and that can clutter up real fast if one task doesn't hide.",1
Useful for quick reminders. But needs some basic improvements. Need a time zone. Due date/time and reminder date/time sounds not be 2 separate setting process. Yes there needs to be both but streamline the setting. Maybe do a default reminder preset-able based on due date. Google calendar does that. Preset reminders would be nice too. Additionally snooze settings etc.,1
Pretty good for quick reminders and to do lists. Some of the features aren't very intuitive especially the my day feature. Also better integration with outlook would be nice. Like if I made a task with a due date it would be cool to have the option for it to appear on my outlook calendar. Otherwise solid app and my go to,1
"Didn't want to switch over on principle, but after trying a couple different list apps, this really is a proper successor to Wunderlist. Can't give a full 5 stars because I don't use the app to its fullest (and didn't Wunderlist either) so I can't speak to total feature functionality, but for what I do need it works perfectly. Widget is great as well",1
"It's so useful! My husband and I can collaborate on the grocery list, household to-do's, baby name ideas and more! Minus one star for the less than intuitive way of deleting items and lists, and it would be neat to be able to have subcategories within lists (i.e. separating the grocery list by department).",1
"It's a great app and very collaborative. I would like to see the option to set your reminder for whatever time you choose (day, hour, and minute) and a ""location based"" reminder would be excellent (i.e. ""remind me when I arrive at: example address""). Still excellent and handy, though! I avidly appreciate the Microsoft family of products! Thank you MS Team",1
"It's good. A great way to remember what I have to get done in a day and have to get done by certain deadlines. A pretty streamlined featureset that doesn't get in the way when you want to add tasks or collaborate with multiple people. However I can't find a way to delete completed tasks automatically. I'm sure it exists, but it's not exactly clear how to achieve this. I swear, it used to be a feature.",1
There is a problem with setting recurring reminders. Even if I add them to my day. A setting that would allow repeating reminders without having to set a due date would be great and the very likely make the feature work (as it currently doesn't). The other problem is notifications. I've set appointments and other events and I don't get prompted with anything. Other than that the app works as intended.,1
"Been using this app for 5 years now. Best app for checking my assignment lists. Love the design as I can customise my own background hence it has been a great help in keeping up my motivation to come back for my assignment. No adds disturbing or money charges. However, one thing that I would like it to improve is that I hope it has a feature where I can move a whole category list to another category list instead of just on of it , else it will be too slow for efficiency as I need to scroll alot",1
"Available on all platforms and systems. Simple and Intuitive. I use it many times a day, often many times an hour. I use ToDo to enter and reorder tasks that do not need dates. I am disappointed the current android release clutters the new task name with a date field. This spoils To Do, making it like a project management app. The date field should be a setting option.",1
"I've tried several to do apps and for me this is the best. Can create several lists to keep organized. I like that it syncs among my different devices and I can add things to shared lists with my family. The most important thing is that I can manually arrange tasks in any order, except in My Day. I give it 4 stars, the only thing this app needs is the ability to move anything marked with due date of today to the My Day List automatically and to sort by time due as well as due date.",1
"UPDATE 2: Microsoft may have fixed the issue below. I have not seen the auto suggestion prompt again. UPDATE 1: Microsoft is doing their best to ruin this app. They enable auto suggestion frequently now and still do not allow us to permanently disable it. ORIGINAL: Was much better before Microsoft took over. I turn off the auto suggestion feature, but Microsoft apparently thinks I need it, so they turn it back on every so often. They need to allow users to permanently turn that feature OFF.",1
"the app is great. I would like to see it able to interface more with the Outlook calendar. Also, it would be nice to be able to insert some text notes right on the face of the overall list itself. it would also be nice to be able to move items quickly from one list to the other list. But this is still a very functional program and I am enjoying it very much.",1
"New user. Love dark theme (on widget too!) and that you can voice command Google Assistant to ""add note"", to populate task list. Also able to add items via tasks widget. Edit by tapping task on widget, opens handy popup with options to mark done or delete, set reminders, star. Looking forward to cool updates. Color coding would be great. Using on Android 9. Did not use Wunderlist.",1
"I love it. very simple and lovely interface, there are two reasons that I gave 4 stars; 1) I wish you add some more view such as week and month of calendar. 2) when I add an event to my outlookCal, then it automaticalky appears in my To Do List. (But currently it doesn't and I have to add tasks or events again in To Do List)",1
"This app is so helpful in managing my business and home responsibilities in one spot. I love that I no longer need multiple apps to manage tasks, and it's synced with my laptop so I'm not glued to my computer just to access my to-do list! There reminder feature is nice too for those really important tasks. I would like the option to create My List for the next day before midnight but that's something I can work around.",1
"With the latest version, the app has become more like Wunderlist (given that Microsoft bought Winderlist it's no surprise). I love the new features like themes and synching across devices. I would like the ability to view all my tasks in all my folders at once tho without having them under My Day. Still the app has come a long way!",1
"Overall, I like the app. You can set daily medication reminders or reminders for things every other day, etc. I have some minor quibbles like it defaults to My Day but it doesn't show what I already planned. So I'd want it to do that or give me the ability to make ""Planned"" my default view.",1
I migrated to this app a few months ago from Wunderlist which I absolutely loved! Im still getting used to this version and the Microsoft integration as I have been a GSuite user for a few years now. While I love this app I took one star for the MyDay list. I get the developers want you to be more intentional BUT I plan my day the night before so this list is useless to me. And with the due dates not auto loading in it also makes it difficult. Nice thought but does not work for night planners.,1
"The best most flexible to-do app I've ever used, and no adware. However, a defect has recently crept in. If you have a recurring daily task, you can't set the due date to ""today"". It briefly flashes today & then changes to tomorrow. Happens on all platforms. Fix it and it'll be 5 stars again. I love this app. I can't believe it's from Microsoft. This one is really for customers, not just for them. See my Windows version review for more ""praise"".",1
"Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from ""my day"". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",1
"I used to Love it, but now as of Jan 2021 it's taking 2 pages for what used to be 1/2 page?! It's now putting my ingredient (grocery list) and then a new line, then the check box by itself and then a new line again... grrr, frustrating! I don't see a fix for this either. This has been my 'go to' app for lists forever üëç Very easy to use",1
"Near identical usability to the outgoing Wunderlist app. I do wish that there was an option to save as a draft or prompt to ask if I really want to exit the quick add of a task. If I'm not careful, I can lose a lot of text description of a task by dismissing a keyboard. That would draw a 5 star rating from me.",1
i have been using microsoft to-do list for some months now. The app is really useful and intuitive. phone and desktop access to a clean UI. It is part of my daily routine and helps me organize business and personal projects. Ideally the export feature would be easier to use.,1
"I love this app! Works great! Only two update requests.... 1. Allow longer text for information entry 2. When we have an item that repeats, such weekly, make it now adjust next repeat date to one week from date completed. Not one week from due date originally set. If the task is late for completion. Or at least have the app ask if it should adjust next repeat",1
"Hello Developers Friends , Can you please add the priority number option in Task Sorting & This option may be optional for user So that we can easy find out priority task Thanks",1
There need more options,1
"nice app, I wish you could customize your lists a bit better though in terms of background and color code. but otherwise it's just a regular app that syncs your todo lists across your devices",1
"With improvements over the last year, this is now become the full full-blooded tasks app many of us have long hoped that it would be. It has everything important that was in Wunderlist, plus a new task model that I have found, over the last couple of years, has reshaped my thinking and actions to make me more effective. I wish it had voice assistant integration and plugged into my Outlook app calendar, both options that exist with Wunderlist but for some reason not yet with To Do.",1
"This has turned out to be a pretty great app! I love the My Day feature. Wishlist: 1. overdue items shown on the Today list, 2. in Wunderlist I could highlight an item when the keyboard was up, but here I have to close the keyboard first, then highlight (that extra step is a distraction and a little annoying), 3. ability to hide Flagged Email list when empty, like you can with the other Smart lists. Otherwise, perfect. Thanks!",1
"My one problem with ToDo was that new irems were added at the bottom of the list instead of at the top because my lists are often hundreds of items long in reverse chronalogical order. At some point it started putting new entries at the top. I then discovered a setting that chooses whether new entries are added at the top or the bottom. I assume that this setting is new, since I had not found that setting at the time it changed. I now really like this app. Now a good replacement for Wunderlist.",1
"This is truly a great app, from my experience. Been looking for this type of functionality and interface for two years. Aesthetically pleasing and user friendly. Have uninstalled so many apps like this before finding this one. A great planner, which I created a shortcut on my phone for, then easy folders set up for my business and writing. A+ grade.",1
I have just started using this app but so far I am pleased. Microsoft Outlook Tasks is a full featured To-do application that has been time tested for years. This app integrates with Outlook Tasks so you can use it as the front end for tasks you have entered in Outlook. The app doesn't have all of the features of Outlook Tasks for creating new tasks but it provides a list of your Outlook tasks that run your day by. Anyone who is an MS Office 365 subscriber should especially consider using this,1
"It's great! I have discovered that this app has almost everything I need. Alarms for med's, for appointments. Schedule tasks once or daily. I try not to schedule too many daily tasks though, because once the daily tasks are complete and on repeat, the tasks get sent to the bottom of the app when completed. Every single task daily must be deleted individually by swiping to the left. It would be really nice if we could delete the completed tasks all at once. The gmail sync would be great!",1
"love this app. nice to look at. syncs across all my devices, apple, microsoft, android. I would like to see widget customization that would be the very last thing to make this app perfect! atleast give us some transparency on the widgets, or more customized options! please! my favorite device for this app is my Note 9, which is great because this phone was designed for tasks and note taking, and a plethora of those accompanying apps. The nicest app for this and syncs very well across the board.",1
"I have an issue keeping organized and remembering to do things. My experience with this app started out not very great but by my own design. Now that i put things in it with reminders and due dates set right away, it's been super helpful. I just have to put the thing i need to do in it as soon as i realize it needs to be done. I would suggest any sort of reminder app for people who struggle keeping their goals and due dates in their head, like myself.",1
"I use it everyday and completely love it. It is very simplistic to use and understand, even for older folks like me! If I'm putting together a list of projects I want to get done; it's allows me to take a picture or a screenshot, then title and save it by Category! Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!",1
"I was nervous about the switch from Wunderlist to Microsoft To Do, but I'm glad my pessimism about it was proven wrong. I like the interface design on the desktop and so far using it on Android is actually just as good if not better than Wunderlist. I'm seeing a lot of outdated reviews regarding being able to add tasks to bottom or top - those are outdated. You can switch between the two. As long as nothing wonky is added or changed, MTD will turn out to be a successful replacement.",1
"On the non-technical note, its a great app. You can use it for so many things, of which ONE is to-do lists. I moslty use it while traveling so i don't forget anything, or miss out on any activity. Some things could be added, like a ringtone to the reminder, or adding more emojis to the list name, but in the end, if you're going to use it for its main purpose, it will serve you well.",1
"Read this if your lists disappeared. Still love the app. Noticed about a week ago all my lists were gone after a recent update to the app. I thought maybe a bug and they would come back but never did. I came on here and saw others reporting the same issue. I was about to contact support, but went ahead and went to the app settings in my phone, cleared cache, cleared data, rebooted phone, signed back into app and all my lists returned.",1
Great app for organizing and sharing . I love how simple it is to use so we can share lists and other users are able to use it without issues. I miss the folders that I had with Wunderlist and would like to see that feature added. Also the notification alerts only once unlike outlook which continues until dismissed. With those 2 changes my rating would go to 5,1
"I LOVE this app! I have it installed on every device. (Phone,tablet, and computer) I literally plan my life with it. I created monthly list so can plan for future dates, or just get stuff I want to do out my head on to something I can organize better. My only requests is it sync up with my Goggle calendar and I can move my items on the list from one list to another. Other than that it's great!!!",1
"I like it. However, when sharing lists, I find it frustrating that I cannot share with someone who has a different email domain. That was not a requirement when the app was called ""Wonder List."" Other than that, I greatly appreciate this phone app. I appreciate the ability to use the app or the Windows desktop app and item stay in sink. I also have many lists shared with my wife and we can both work on items and they stay in sync... even when we are not in direct contact. Technology is awesome.",1
"I never write reviews but I love this app! I have tried a couple to-do listapps before and never found them really helpful. As a law student I need to keep track of a bunch of things and this app makes wrangling assignments, meetings and tasks so simple. I like that in addition to having your daily tasks there is a list making feature. It's also just plain fun to use. You have the option to change the theme and you get the perfectly satisfying ding sound when you check off a task.",1
"I was very hesitant to switch from Wunderlist to this app. Especially given that Microsoft bought out Wunderlist just to kill it and push ""To Do"". However, over the last year.. as updates have ended on Wunderlist and ""to do"" has continued to get better - I have slowly become a fan. I've switched over all my notes now. So far, I'm happy with this app. However, please remove the ""Delete List"" option from inside of the list. It's too easy to make a mistake there. Allow deleting only from outside.",1
"I used to be extremely organized & keeping a small notepad with each day's to-do was the key. Over the years I've fallen away from that with more use of the digital calendar - which just isn't the same. This app is PERFECT for a list making person like me. I love the way it's formatted, that you can make sub-lists, and that your flagged outlook emails are noted! There's a certain satisfaction in checking things off your list. Great app!! üëçüëç",1
"I downloaded the Microsoft ""To Do"" app late in 2022. I explored it a little and I didn't like it because it didn't seem easy to adapt to. So I stopped using it. But now that Microsoft has updated Outlook and migrated the previous ""Task"" function from Outlook to ""To Do"" I have been compelled to learn how to use it, and I like it now. All of the previous ""Task"" functions are still available but in a streamlined fashion, and there are additional ways to customize a task in the app. Fantastic!",1
"The widget is spectacular and being able to quickly enter multiple tasks on the computer is wonderful. The widget shows all the useful data and shows the next recurring task as soon as I complete the current one. I tried Samsung's and Google's task programs. They integrated with my calendar (which I thought was important), but they were both woefully lacking. This program needs another program to sync with Google calendar. I don't like the idea of having to use a separate program to sync (I don't want to give companies I don't know or trust access to my data if possible). I thought that would be a big deal, but my calendar is actually cleaner without the tasks in it, and the widget takes away the need to have it there. I highly recommend you try it.",1
"Finally, a dedicated To-Do management application! I've cycled through various alternatives from Google Keep to Calendar but never stuck to one. My favorite feature of Microsoft To-Do is its ability to add tasks from different lists to a consolidated ""My Day"" view, allowing me to prioritize the tasks for that day. So far I've been using the app for a couple of months and have not had to reach for any alternatives.",1
Update: Thank you for fixing the add item to top feature. Now it adds it to the top of ther list instead of the bottom. No more having to scroll to the bottom to manually move it to the top. Many many thanks. I learned about the Wunderlist buyout. So I transferred over to MS To Do List. I love it & will surely miss my Wunderlist. MS To Do List is almost identical. I wasn't too afraid of the change. MS works great. Thx,1
"This app is amazing, everything I could ever ask for in a task app. Especially the widget. It's so neat and clean. Repeating tasks option. It doesn't auto delete tasks when completed. I have not explore it completely but I love it. Microsoft Please add a feature to delete tasks at a set time. Like daily, weekly, monthly, set date, etc.this would be a nice bonus.",1
"Absouloutly Amazing! I am a very list oriented person, and this app is such a great and handy app to keep everything in your life organized, from work jobs to household chores. The one thing I would improve is the design. It doesn't have a very aesthetically pleasing format. But other than that, I would not change a thing. Thank you Microsoft!",1
"ADHD? This apps for me. I work full time as an engineer and artwork on the side, so things can be a little nutters when it comes to being organized. This app has helped a lot, especially since I can have it synced across my pc, phone, and tablet. Very simple, easy to use, and no adds or premiums. My only nitpick is not being able to choose the background color on the phone widget itself (in app its fine.)",1
"Best to-do so far. Created by Microsoft, it has all the reliable things you would expect from them. One feature that I heard is coming, but has not arrived yet is the organization of stacked lists (lists inside lists, etc.). They keep it running nicely and update frequently. If you need to organize your life or if you have a job that requires a lot of tasks to complete, this is the app for you.",1
"As an avid wunderlist user I was a bit afraid of using Microsoft's version of wunderlist. I researched all of the other options and finally decided to take a chance. The conversion from wunderlist and the user interface was simple, bug free, and most importantly, did not require learning a new interface (unlike the transitions from the various releases of Windows!!!!!). I have several shared lists with quite elderly and computer illiterate friends who were afraid to transition. No problems",1
"Helps me keep my life in order. It's seamlessly incorporated itself into much life. It's unobtrusive, and useful. Besides the standard to do, I use the create a list feature to keep track of books I want to read, and shows and movies I want to watch. It's helpful to be able to pop those things into a virtual list (that syncs across devices) when someone makes a recommendation.",1
"There are few expectations out of a To Do app - operation and be everywhere. This app does that perfectly. I never had any hiccups regarding it not syncing on time or anything of that sort. I love the fact that it works on so many platforms smoothly - Outlook, smart phone, laptops.. Plus, it's has a great UI, simple thoughtful, yet options and settings to do nearly everything. And if you use it for work, you can create group and then lists. Microsoft, at least you got something right!",1
"After years of using Wunderlist, I was nervous about moving over to this new app, but I should've known I had no reason to be! When it first moved over, my only complaint WAS that new tasks only went to the bottom instead of the top of the list, but they fixed it almost immediately. Any complaints you have they're quick to take care of. I love the additional features they didn't have in Wunderlist, ease of use, and how easy it is to share lists with my husband and use for work. Excellent app!",1
"CANNOT recommend this app enough. Absolutely works wonders and is incredibly simple and user friendly with lots of nice options for colors and customizing lists. All for free too which is remarkable. As someone who often feels anxious when handling a number of tasks at once this app is quite literally life changing. Basically a perfect, and endless paperless alternative to a planner so thats always great.",1
"I transferred from Wunderlist. I enjoy many features, especially being able to share it all with another person. They have fixed some of the comments I've seen like you can tell it to put a new item at the top of the list. Only problem I've seen is when I move a weekly item to a different day, it keeps the reminder on the day it was originally on.",1
"Awesome app. Allows for custom lists and allows collaboration on ones you specifiy for group projects/tasks. The interface is clean, crisp, but also allows you to make it your own by adding color themes to the accents of the task pages. The only thing I wish this would include is a customizable ""smart list"" based on certain parameters. This would make the app even better, though out of the box - this has everything you need to get your tasks and projects done!",1
"I was a user of Wunderlist but then MS bought them out and transitioned to TODO. It's about the same, at least for the features I use/used. I like that my wife and I can share lists and assign tasks through it. I haven't checked to see if it offers location features - that was a feature I liked from the similar ""G"" based offering.",1
"Seems to have implemented most of the best features from Wunderlist, acquired in 2018/9. Easy to add tasks/headings and move them from one heading to or rearrange them in any order, dismiss or restore them. IMPROVABLE: Give us ability to add images (eg that represent parts of a pattern I want to build a plan by) or (on a lower priority: to select one's own background).",1
"Fantastic experience! Has everything I need, utterly useful, and a beautiful, convenient, easy, and frankly enjoyable way to capture all my random thoughts and get myself organized!!! I love how it perfectly synchronizes with my work email, computer, and calendar. Only thing I would change is have more background themes to further customize and personalize it, or the ability to add your own themes or pictures.",1
"This app is incredibly versatile, it provides a variety of useful features without being cluttered. The layout is easy to navigate, and it makes setting daily goals and organizing to-do lists much easier. It's definitely boosted my productivity, and I would strongly reccomend this to anyone with an existing microsoft account.",1
I love this app! I recommend it to everyone I know. It is so easy to use. I can create multiple lists to keep different areas of my life organized. I can send kids on errands and share my lists with them so they know exactly what I want or what the household needs. We can with together as a family accomplishing things together with the share feature. Again... I love this app!,1
I have been using this a lot since last year. It is a good addition for more organization. it takes a lot of practice to get into it. It can be overwhelming at first but the app pools categories very nicely and it is also integrated to my outlook which is great. You can also categorized and put tasks in different lists. I love it. It make me more productive everyday.,1
"Well done here....not always a Microsoft fan but this app is simple and intuitive. I have tried so many ""GTD"" apps, to do lists, etc... So far they lean heavy either on too busy, too many clicks needed to get a task put in or....missing one or two key features that were really needed. This one....it's simple and effective. Finally....thank you!",1
"Edit: everything is working. I reached out to support and they asked to uninstall the app, restart phone, and install. I cleared the cached and data first, uninstalled, restarted, installed and was able to add both accounts without further issues. These apps work great and help streamline daily tasks. These nuances get in the way sometimes but I'm glad it's all working again! Thank you MS Support!",1
"This is the best to-do list on the market. You can use it stand alone, but the great thing is that it also syncs with your outlook or exchange server data. Everything automatically syncs. I also use this app to track my goals and habits, and to stay focused. This checklist app has done wonders to help with my productivity.",1
"I've used this app for several years now. I absolutely LOVE IT! I've got a grocery list that I share with both of my teen/young adult kids, and they just add what they need to it and I don't have to keep adding things they tell me myself. Or worse yet, forget what they ask me to get. I've got a separate list that I don't share with anyone with my packing list for travel and one for movies I want to see. I just love this app! I used it before Microsoft & I love it more now!",1
"Essential. Wonderful Amazing, been with it since the WunderList days. Always Adding New Features, however the latest updates cause basic loading of tasks to go slower than I would like. Noted on two different phones. It may not be that long but when you're moving in and out of tasks fast and often there's a noticable hang time. Still a wonderful program.",1
"Of all popular to-do applications (doist, ticktick, etc.) this one is free and has most levels of organization. You can create groups, which contains lists of To-Dos and each To-Do can have sub-tasks. Each To-Do has option for many file attachments and lists can be shared with other users for interactive collaboration. Not only does this app do it better, but it's also free! PC, Mac, Android, iOs native apps. No Linux desktop app, sadly, but web-interface is very good",1
"I like the way this app looks and works. I say this because I've tried othees that we're similar and I prefer this one. I like how it's Microsoft which syncs with my Google accts. The only issue for me is remembering to open it and actually do the tasks I listed....if I would just do that I would be golden! But instead I rarely do- therefore the list never shrinks but gradually increases instead, making it all the more daunting... Such is life.. 1 day at a time, 1 task at a time. ‚úåÔ∏è Pese",1
"I use this app for keeping track of grocery and pharmacy shopping. We all end up having to go to multiple stores to get all our various needs met, so making a list for each separate store helps! I also make a To Do list. Nothing feels as good as hitting the button after completion and hearing that satisfying ding as it disappears from my list! I have lists for books to read, movies/tv to watch, and garden/nursery supplies needed.",1
"I tried Microsoft right after Wunderlist was discontinued several years ago, and HATED it. However, I decided to give it another try, and I'm glad I did! I like it MUCH BETTER NOW! The dark theme, unlimited open source categories, and ease of use brought me back. I would, however, like to see more solid colors added to the themes, and the capability to add your own photos to use as themes. Otherwise, it's perfect!",1
"Great app! Keeps me on track. What I'd like to see though is reminders also repeat when a task repeats. Repeating tasks can't be set for a particular weekday for monthly, but yes for weekly...odd. Like I want a repeating task for Sat. once a month...can't do that. A calendar view would be great. When the app updates, my tasks in the status bar disappear but don't return after (minor thing).",1
"Perfect to do list: can add steps for an item, reminders, and add things to My Day, which helps because there's no way I can do everything on my to do lists in one day so it helps me prioritize. Most importantly, I can move things up and down within the list or to another list. Sounds minor but it's not a feature on many apps. Developers, a nice future enhancement: add tags so have the ability to view across lists, by tag. And view by due date across lists. But great as is and helpful!!",1
"This is an excellent task tracker for small projects. The notes section is critical to keeping track of specifics and notations. I also use it to keep track of correspondence with vendors. It would be even better to have a date/timestamp feature that I can use when documenting phone calls. Right now, I have to manually key in the date and time before I make notes. In some instances I can have multiple phone calls for one task. I've had software in the past with that feature and it's great!",1
"Exceptional and robust productivity app by Microsoft. The app is packed with features that seamlessly integrate with Microsoft services. Keep up with your flagged emails, make dynamic lists, customize the appearance of the indicidual lists, create shared lists.. I could not be more happy with an app in this category. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a solid ""to-do"" list app that is much more than a glorified notepad. 10/10 stars if possible.",1
"This app keeps me sane at work and organized at home. This is by far the best To-Do app I've ever used. I love the ability to schedule things to do as one time or reoccurring tasks, have multiple lists, group lists, and be able to access your list from any device you install the app on and sign into your account with. The only thing I wish was added was being able to add your own background picture or custom color rather than pick from the very few options available.",1
"It is a great step forward. Microsoft has a lot of assets within the office setting and this is just solidifying their position as king. The app could use some improvements: - 'open in outlook option for email chains. Could be awesome, but it opens via the web browser. I could maybe accept this on the app for a little longer, but on the desktop version this should open the email chain via outlook (if you have it) directly. - a refresh button",1
"Surprisingly amazing app. Ive been through all the online and app planners out there and this by far is the best one (for me at least). This is great if you are using it for school or anything with deadlines. If you like a clear set list on what you need to do and when you need to do it, with a little bit of elbow room to do that, then this app is great for you! It has reminders and lists that you can categorize as well, which I find very helpful. I use it for highscool and chores/tasks!",1
"This is my absolute favorite app on my phone, and my PC. The fact that it's so easily ties into Outlook is amazing, and makes my life so much easier. Being able to add individual steps to each task to allow me to complete certain objectives in pieces is absolutely incredible, I feel like I am fully on top of my game and it is impossible to forget anything these days. Highly recommended for anyone that has a chaotic workflow and needs a little organization in their life. Absolutely incredible!",1
"Really nice. Has all the features you could want in this kind of app. UI is beautiful. While I'll miss Wunderlist, this app is a worthy successor, and I don't think they could have made it any easier to switch over. Hopefully Google Assistant support is added at some point, but given this is a Microsoft app, I have a feeling it's entirely up to Google whether or not they want to play nice. Please Google, please.",1
"I love how I can set labels for tasks to keep them organized and have the ability to move them over to a Today view so that I only need to look at what I want to try to accomplish everyday. The app also does a good job of syncing so my phone and laptop stay up to date with each other. No complaints, and really the way it is set up makes me gravitate to it more than other tasks/reminder/list apps that I have used",1
"SO useful, I was bummed at first when I found out this app was replacing the Wunderlist app I used for years (Microsoft bought it and it became To Do list I guess), but this is incredibly convenient and easy to use. No pads of paper with lists scribbled on them laying around. It only takes a second to create, update or edit a list and it's straightforward to learn how to use. Best list app I've found.",1
"Great app. I prefer this over Google tasks. Google task is very basic into the point. Microsoft took it just a little bit farther, and thankfully this is one of those apps where they don't actually push anything on you. There aren't any ads or anything that forces you to use Microsoft features. It's a clean and useful app, could use some more features, but it definitely has the basics of exactly what you need",1
"This app is as good as Trello and almost works the same with some minor differences. I love it. It would be great if it combined the features of Trello Boards as well as Evernote. Still givin deserves 5 stars on its own merits. It can get overwhelming the more items that are put into it, but that's my own problem of having so much to do more than the app. This is the best automated To Do list I have found. I use it in combination with my handwritten lists.",1
"Easy to keep up with all my task lists and honey-dos. I'm asked to do something at home or work and I magically seem to remember because this allows me to see notifications and reminders across all of my devices including my Invoke smart speaker, my Xbox, my computer at work and home and on my phone. All around the most usable across everything and very simple interface. Love it.",1
"This app is really great! It is so easy to use from day one. Easy set up and nice organization. I love how I can oragnize my tasks into differnet subjects (unlike other apps) and get remiders of when stuff is due and that if I want to see an overview of everything, I can! Being able to choose themes makes the app more customizable. The only thing is when making titles you can choose emojis but from a limited list.",1
"Better Than I initially Thought it would Be Seriously, this app is great. I thought because it was an Microsoft app that can work on andorid it wouldn't be as great. It works great on both platforms. Love how it ascetically looks. Simple but has a tone of nice features for a note app. Easy to make list, make a group for list, sync to both devices and more. Worth the download, its my main note taking/list app.",1
"Great app!!! Able to keep track of projects, add steps to tasks, keep notes. It has simple, easy to use intuitive interface. Looks same on all platforms (android, apple and windows) so you don't have to relearn how app works on each one. Amazing part it's free, and it has apps on a d syncs across all devices, including desktops. The only thing that I could think of would be if it was integrated with Outlook. Other than that Looks, huge thanks Windows Team!",1
"I like how the experience is ad-free, and is able to sync across all of my devices. Best of all, it has an offline mode, and is totally free. However, it would be nice if the app had more customization in regards to the backgrounds and appearance. A seasonal or monthly automatic wallpaper change like Google Calendar would be nice.",1
"Being able to see my Outlook take together with other take I create and be able to organize them in a useful way is so helpful. I also love My Day, and how it starts empty each day, so I can start each day with a fresh assessment of priorities. Otherwise I just keep adding stuff to my daily to-do list until it gets so cluttered that I stop looking at it altogether!",1
the drawback is the worker also can edit the work assigned by others to him...,1
Please add fingerprints / pin or any security option. Because My tasks are very personal to me,1
Can really do better with the reminders. Would also like search functions and easier access to features,1
"Good app, reminder must be there.",1
Nice and easy to use. You're easily able to share with anyone else or use by your self,1
very useful app to remind everything,1
"Hi Microsoft team, I want to give my suggestion 1. adding a new feature of voice notes or voice tasks to the app that will make it easier to add tasks and manage them 2. There should be option of some sort of time counting that will show how much time he has consumed on that task 3. Option of repeat tasks",1
Very easy to use. Good job guys.,1
Microsoft is low key better at business stuff than Google is.,1
It would be nice if they had an option to automatically add overdue tasks to My Day so that incompleted tasks don't fall through the cracks,1
"In addition to grouped by due date in Planned list, you should also add sort by due date. Currently, it is only grouped by due date, but the tasks are sorted alphabetically making it complicated to know which tasks should be done first",1
Please make a Wear OS version üôè,1
"A bot basic, but functional enough.",1
The app is great but whenever I customise the background it disappears,1
perfect app for me to plan a day and execute the plans,1
"great app, very clean organized, and self explanatory. reorganizing lists is simple but slow if your list gets too long. this is my only note keeping it from 5 starts",1
perfect,1
Amo o aplicativo! Sugiro integra√ß√µes com outros APP. N√£o consigo repassar as tarefas ao calend√°rio Outlook e outros. Tamb√©m seria bacana inserir in√≠cio e vencimento/fim para as tarefas.,1
Leave me alone,1
very Hady and easy to use links nicely with my phone to plan tasks etc.,1
"My 9:30pm reminder shows up at 8:30 for some reason. Other than that, useful and effective.",1
only admin delete list,1
I guess if voice note would have been there it would be more beneficial,1
love this app! it would be 5 stars if there could an option to mark things as not complete.,1
I wish I could move the order of the tasks of my day. In my agenda I used to put a number on the left side.,1
Please can The Eisenhower Matrix productivity quadrants be added to the app? To boost productivity,1
This app is so good to do a day plan. Please add timer to make a perfect time planer.,1
easy to use,1
Please add location reminders,1
"When i select the task as done, sometimes it won't show that task for few minutes. Seems like it's a bug.",1
"I like this overall, but it won't stop nagging me about having it's notifications disabled. I don't want your notifications, stop bugging me about it every time I open the app.",1
"Please , add more colors to the tasks .. the app has boring colors",1
Its a really good app for planning and listing your works. more importantly reminders about task /work in email.,1
Better if include delete all completed tasks option.,1
"I originally left to two-star review after switching from Wunderlist. I was really annoyed that I was forced to switch apps, but after a few months of using this I've realized it is far better than Wunderlist in almost every way (except for the brief pause to load lists that Wunderlist never had). It's loaded with every available feature you could possibly want and I'm very pleased with it overall. Thanks for a great free list tool.",1
"Very user friendly and great to use for work, home, or just for fun/ideas/wishlists. I use it for all of it and it's been a game changer. Would definitely like to have more ability to customize/personalize things with colors/images and put in photos in the lists (unless that's already a feature that I'm not aware of/don't know how to use) in case you need a visual aid.",1
"I love this app, I use it for everything! I do have one suggestion, but it's not important enough for me to dock stars haha. Since you can due dates for tasks, I think it would be cool/ easier to use if there were a calendar section (that looks like a traditional calendar) so you can see all your tasks all at once instead of scrolling through them.",1
"Uncomplicated design that's easy to get familiar with. The ,, that is easy to use moving seamlessly from phone to tablet to computer while having the ability to check off items or add more without having to reach for another device. The ability to move from one device to another without problem is the feature that I considered a must-have for a list. Especially when all other comparable apps were single device or wasn't didn't really meet the definition of a tasks and list app.",1
"Absolutely love this app and the many ways you can form a list. It's changed my life and how I use my mobile. I tried to get away from hand-written lists with various ""notes"" apps, but the lists got too long, too unwieldy, and too disorganized, and I couldn't sync across devices. To Do solved all those issues, and also allowed me to grab whichever one of my devices is closest at hand, without skipping a beat.",1
"Extremely flexible, fairly intuitive, and versatile. Takes the place of several other apps I had been using, for notes, reminders, lists, life balance trackers... and wraps it all up in a daily to-do list that is totally personalized and editable. Apparently you can sync up with your other devices, though I haven't tried that feature yet.",1
"Best app by far for to-do lists and i have tried many. Very clean, simple, uncluttered. I especially like the My Day feature that makes it easy to get focused upon the most important things to do each day. I now use this app exclusively for to-do lists as well as other lists (goals, shopping, routines, conversations, media to watch/read/listen, etc.) which each get their own list group. There are a lot of good to-do/list apps out there but this one is great and I highly recommend it.",1
"I was using another to-do-list app for several years which started becoming unfunctional. I decided to give this one a try. The list creation setup works with your imagination. So far it totally meets my needs and then some. The sync between devices is awesomely immediate! There is one functionality that I would like to see implemented which is the ability to sort list ""STEPS"" by a selection choice the same way that lists can be sorted. Overall, it's a keeper app!",1
"Pretty useful, works as both a collection of lists for myself as well as lists I share with my girlfriend. Has nice features vs other list programs as well. Couple things I don't super like, (but still think it's a five star program): Each list item can only be so long (a few sentences), definitely wish it were a little longer. And it has a nice feature of letting you choose to add new items at the top or bottom of your lists, but it's a universal setting instead of being per list.",1
"I was looking for an app, years ago, I could use that would sync with gmail. Sorry Google, I'm not a fan of gmail. Had to settle for using Wunderlist, which worked fine at that time, but eventually moved away from using it when we were able to switch over to Outlook for business, which I prefer. So happy Microsoft came up with the ""To Do"" app. Syncs to Outlook. I can add items to the list from desktop or app. However, I do have more options available on the desktop, but still recommend it. üëçüëç",1
Love love love this!! Easiest to use and most tightly integrated to-do list I've worked with yet for anybody that uses Office 365 and Outlook. Only Gap I see at the moment is the ability to assign tasks from the mobile app. However it works perfectly when you assign tasks from Outlook. We just need the reverse functionality as well and then this thing is nearly perfect. The only other comment is it would be nice to have some easy way to add priorities Beyond just the favorites üåü Must have!,1
"A bit more innovative than similar apps I've used. The fact that it integrates automatically with outlook is icing on the cake. The only suggestions I can think of right now would be to add more customization options for colors, especially. A color mixer is at the top of my wish list. But the bottom-line is that I had no problems getting up-to-speed after a couple of hours of random use. The app doesn't crash, supports floating windows; well-done.",1
"When Microsoft announced they were killing Wunderlist, my expectations for the New Thing were soooo low. But they did a great job! It has all the familiar featues plus some new ones like subtasks, and the user experience is pretty solid! Importing was easy. Great job! The one negative is Microsoft's strongheaded wrong assumption that everyone wants ""one Microsoft account for everything."" Please preserve the ability to create different accounts for different purposes!",1
"May 22, 2020 - updating to 5 stars, this app is my go-to. Easy to use, pleasing UI, and sharing is easy. Also, thanks for listening and responding! Was a 5, dropping to 3 after last update. Separating completed items would be fine (though less tidy visually than hiding), but sort orders now don't apply to completed items. Grocery lists become much more tedious, as you have to now either search through an unsorted list or type every grocery list item again from memory.",1
Can be simpeler with accounts,1
"For someone with ADHD who forgets things constantly (minute by minute), having an app that syncs across any device I want (PC, phone, work computer, etc) is a huge benefit. Think of some random thing I want to do? Add it on the phone, and then I can see it when I go to my PC next. It's a pretty darn good free app. It syncs with Outlook, too, for those of us who use it for work or whatever.",1
"This is -to me- the most intuitive to-do app I've found so far. It's not big, it works well across my devices, it's simple but offers more depth when desired. Example: I can make a general list and decide which items need reminders etc. The app doesnt make me go through several screens for every single item, prompting me to set up dates, notifications, steps, etc.",1
"Almost as good as Wunderlist. The only thing I would change, and this is very minor, is that every time I open the app, it goes automatically to the last list I updated, instead of to the main list of lists. That's my only pet peeve. My husband and I share grocery lists, Home Depot lists, etc through this app now that Wunderlist is gone, and it's very useful and user-friendly.",1
I was a longtime Wunderlist user and had a very hard time converting over to the Microsoft To Do. Once I got into the app and started using it I saw it was still a very good app even though there were differences between it and Wunderlist. I have completely converted over and probably use the Microsoft To Do app for more things than I did Wunderlist. The ability to switch between accounts is very helpful to separate personal and business lists.,1
I really like it because it works from my computer and my phone and the information put in one will be accessible to the other. Great for making lists and being able to check things off. You can also reuse the lists for another time. I have a packing list that I have used repeatedly so I don't forget anything important. Planning meals so you can remember what was needed for a meal,1
"The hardest thing to do (pun unintended) was to get into the habit of checking my To Do list everyday. I'd write down things but would not add a reminder, and so, it was useless. After some serious commitment, I started putting down things as soon as they came up, and would also add a reminder. Today, I finally am using this app to my advantage and it has helped be more responsible. I never miss an appointment or something important I have to do.",1
"'Microsoft to do list' is a great and I use it constantly. One nice feature is that you can start your most important and group them at the top or with the sort feature. Other nice features are the ability to add steps, coordinate with calendar, & use due dates. It's very easy to use. You can share your list with others but not all. I think it may not work well between Android and iPhone. Haven't tried this recently.",1
good,1
The application can add an additional feature of alarm facility,1
task planned for tomorrow sometimes show in my current day. that's my only issue,1
very good app- but the balance days for the expiry is not added Pls. make update on this,1
"this App is friendly use but it has a little bug. for example 1- share todo not complete i mark to my day but my coworker not see, i tern on notifications but my coworker not see and so on 2- remember notifications have bug 3- It's not level for todo and don't have highlight for important and immediately works",1
very good app for day planning,1
"Can you please add starting time and finish time in it? It would be a better tracker of what we're doing. And please make it in a way that when we decide to do the task, we have to push the ""start"" button, to generate the time it's started. Even Google Task has it. Don't lose to Google",1
The app is chic and simple to use and one will find it very helpful in making tasks and keeping up to date with the day. I however think that the app would have had notifications that could at least remind you to keep track of your time and tasks,1
"I don't know where this app has been my entire life but I can't go without it now. I had paid for a different to do list app and it was absolutely terrible. There wasn't an option to set reminders, no due dates, no repeating events. It was a complete mess and I'd get so overwhelmed by it that I wouldn't get much accomplished, paper and pen would have been better. However, this app has been my ultimate life saver for my crazy busy life. It's so easy to use and isn't sloppy. You can add a task straight from your notification bar (s7 edge) if you enable that in your settings. I love not having to check it constantly throughout the day because I set a customized reminder with the task. I have this on my phone (primary use) and my computer, they sync without a single issue. My only complaint about this app is I personally don't need the ""Important"" list and there isn't an option to delete it.",1
Splendid,1
Still need some improvements!,1
"Thank you very much for your great effort, Dev & Team! However, this app needs to sync with my calendar which is not what I needed.",1
Very useful to track your time. I would prefer a one time payment for the pro version tho. Edit: read through their reasoning for subscription model. I agree with their reasoning. I guess I would argue for a lower subscription price instead.,1
Plz give check out option so that it clearify which task is completed or which one is not. And give all analysis that what percentage of task is completed,1
"This is a great app! Very useful and efficient even without premium. Although i think you should add a ""completed"" feature. Or just like a box to tick. It would be very useful. Thank you very much.",1
It's great! But I believe some more features like giving insights on my schedule can be incorporated to make a one stop for productivity.,1
"Excellent,this is the type of app I was looking for.My schedule changes every month so the templates really come im handy.The only thing I think would be cool to add is a new type of persistent notification where it shows the duration of the task like in the app.",1
"Good app, it gives u a time schedule, but when i finished making my daily routine, i moved to the next day that should've had the same schedule as the day before, but i found that the times for my task have changed and overlapped",1
"It is an excellent planner, I love the GUI and the options to add your own tags etc and the only thing missing is to include the ability to sync blocks /schedules between devices",1
great time boxing tool,1
Very helpful to manage timeüéâ,1
the notifications won't pop up on the screen but this app is great for scheduling the day... but my pop ups üò≠üò≠üò≠ all I hear is noise but I have no idea what's happening,1
"I am premium user. Plz add instant backup & backup interval choosing option , so that we can instantly continue on other gadget simultaneously.",1
I really like this for scheduling my daily activities. It helps me stay on task. I just wish there was a way to use it in the computer as well as the phone.,1
can you please add a jump to present date option when setting for start date... it's bothersome when I try to edit a block..,1
Good,1
"Really love this app, but an addition I would love is having the option to have the persistent notification not show during free time (unscheduled time). That way it doesn't get in the way when I'm not scheduled to be doing anything. As it is now I have to turn off persistent notification everytime I'm done working for the day and turn it back on when I go to bed.",1
"Great when it works, but sometimes fails to update alerts. Have looked at my battery settings, including using don't kill my app instructions, but it doesn't seem to make a difference as the error occurs randomly.",1
"Good app but id doesn't let me select which google calendar to sync, if I have various. I pretend to use this app por day routine and I usually not use the main calendar for daily routines, instead I created a new one inside my own account. This app won't let me use sync that calendar.",1
"Set the Time Management once and forget...thereafter whenever you open the app it will show you what you need to do now at present and how much time elapsed and remaining for the present task, etc. Excellent App but Reminder Alarm most of the time not working so one star reduced.",1
"I like this a lot, but for whatever reason there is a glitch with the Template putting duplicates whenever I add them to new days. I thought I had accidentally added the same agenda item twice but the template itself looks normal. It's only when I add it to a day.",1
"Overall best scheduling app but the only problem that it the reminders does not work (specially when we apply templates in which reminders are already set), which is most important thing for me.",1
"could be more intuitive. but as it is, it's good, deserves a solid 4-5 stars as is.",1
"It's exactly suited to my time management needs. I only have 2 real gripes: 1.) I need to have my notification sound on in order to get notifications sound. That means, not just timetune, but every text, push notification, etc, would have my phone yelling at me, which is annoying. I tried Alarm volume channel, but that didn't create any sound either. 2.) It'd be great to have a widget that displayed JUST the current time block, not the continuous schedule into the distant future.",1
"Its simple and straight to the point I am loving this app! Though, I do have problems that the app widget does not update unless I open the app and other similar shenanigans. I would also love to see a loading bar instead in the persistent notifications, if that's possible it just would look really cool. Anyways, thanks, and if I have money to spare I'd buy your premium options. Cheers!",1
"May not be best experience for free user like me, but it is an excellent app.",1
Really great system and something Ive been looking for a while. Would have been perfect if the Calendar events were part of the statistics.,1
"Wonderful app, I've absolutely no problems at all.",1
"Love the app so far - it's great for helping me organize my daily routines. What would be really helpful though, is if I could insert a Block/Event into a specific day and time frame and have this override the normally scheduled routine for that time period. Right now it shows both the Block and the normal routine for that time frame in the schedule, as if I could do both the Block tasks and normal routine tasks simultaneously... which doesn't make sense to me.",1
"So far the app looks really great! The only suggestion that I could have that would immensely improve the experience is to create tasks/check lists and having them on the widget too for easy check off (hiding the ones you checked). This would greatly inprove the experience and enhance productivity - description is nice to have but have a checklist task section under it would also be immensely helpful. I hope this suggestion can be taken on board, if it was there then this would definitely be 5*",1
App is very good for use mentioned. But the permanent notification not showing many times when any saved task is happening. I have checked all settings like no restrictions for battery saving etc but still permanent notification gone for no reason. Please improve for showing notifications on time also if we have not opened app within few hours..,1
Decent in terms of Routine.,1
Love the ability to create templates (e.g for my workweek). Would love for the option to be able to create tickable Task or To-do per each time block on my daily/weekly schedule.,1
"I finally have found an app that allows me to create a visual log of my routine which helps me stay on task and focused on the task at hand. however, I wish there was a way to quickly create subtasks during blocks. I don't mind bridging my to do apps in, but it would be helpful if it was all in one place.",1
Very nice looking app however it drains my battery. Idk why it needs so much power.,1
Great app at start but know it is not refreshing the blocks and no alarm is working you should allow more emojis and colours and I have seen no ad till now very good app I appreciate your efforts. You should not decrease anything in this but improve and add something such as more emojis and fast refreshing etc,1
üëçüëçüëçüëç,1
"Absolutely adore this app so far and I've barely had it for one day, extremely helpful for someone with adhd and who struggles to prioritize tasks and get things done promptly. The only thing that's keeping me from wanting to raise this to a 5 star review is the fact that the 'voice' feature in notifications doesn't seem to function as expected, it'd be helpful to add a feature to this where either a male or female voice reads out the task title then custom message.",1
good,1
perfect,1
This is very good app,1
"Would love a tick feature I love this app! Perfect for getting my everyday uni routine pinned down. I really appreciate that it has dark mode and the text is easy to read. I lovee how many reminders of various durations and settings I can have, even ones that alert me after that event! The ui is very easy to understand. Thank you for your hard work. Redownloading now that the overlap issue is gone.",1
"I love the app. I wish the calendar events were taggable. I also wish it had a checklist feature. I would like to be able to keep track of that things in my schedule I actually did or didn't do. When you check it off, it could have a line through it but you can still see it.",1
"everything is fine but i bought premium version expecting to get more features in it , would you include pomodoro technique feature in it ?",1
"Exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to understand, super clean interface and has all the necessary features even if you don't buy premium. I only have one complain regarding the permanent notification, the most important feature. I would love it if we had more options to customise the permanent notification according to our needs, like option to show title of the task atleast. For now we only see tags which makes it a bit confusing to tell tasks apart. Maybe a task progress bar too.",1
I use your application since 1 January 2023 This is very helpful for me to manage my time A small suggestion for this application plz accepted that üôè Give our data in a pdf format to be downloaded it very helpful to read plz think about that,1
I love the app but I hope you give us update where we can customize color or photo of the background. ü§û,1
"The only thing missing is when the reminder notification pops up, an option to say that it's ""in progress"" at the start or that you completed at end of time block. I mostly use this stay consistent with a routine and manage my time",1
"extremely helpful app! allows me to organize and alot my time in a way that perfectly fits the way i think about time, with many tools and customization options to help! my only complaint really is that there is no middle ground between paying a subscription or just using the free version... its a very useful app and i would like to support the developers without having to commit money forever. please consider adding a form of one time payment for no ads or a few extra features or something!",1
can you please add a jump to present date option when setting for start date... it's bothersome when I try to edit a block..,1
"It is useful for setting time to work on something. I wish at the same time it also had an option not to use a block. Also, a timer to finishing an assignment would be useful. Additionally, being able to repeat templates, but not at the exact same times of the day would be useful. Also, putting a tasks in between a block such as a break. As for paying, I would consider it for a one time payment or definite number of payments",1
"Really good overall, only bad thing is that block notification doesn't show up always I need to go to settings to apply it again so it will appear. Besides that, everything is excellent. Best schedule app.",1
"Loving the app, just needs an update so we can view the full week schedule...",1
"Couldn't recommend this enough to people like me who need easy, quick to make day plans to help avoid procrastination. My only minor complaint is that if I try to extend one of my time blocks and it clashes with what follows it, it gives a warning but there's no easy way to just push everything back together. You have to change each time individually even when I can drag and change the time of over blocks easily, just not when they clash. Fix this and it's a perfect app!!",1
very helpful I've been looking for a daily planner for thing for a long time !! I like how you can have templates very helpful !!,1
I love the app allows for actual use without adds and having to pay. Would 100% recomend one of the best organization apps I have found. Though I wish the had a way to but task(not as blocks). The task thing does not matter that much you can use paper or other apps.,1
great app but annoying to change one time slot to add a few minutes and then you realize you have to change them all. one minor change should adjust the rest. a simple algorithm would suffice? It's not as simple as changing one. The feature is ok in itself but it would be ideal to be able to edit an hour block into one hour and a half (if an activity takes longer than planned) and the activities that lay ahead automatically adjust their timings. This is the real issue everyone has.,1
"Llevo usando esta app hace un 6 meses, y es muy buena para organizar tu rutina diaria por blockes de tiempo, mi sugerencia seria ver un dia completo de un vistaso, zoom a la tabla, para saber como organize mi dia y si esta bien estructurado.",1
This app and it's features are great but I wish there was a way to move a entire schedule up or down however much we want,1
"Great app, i suggest for a feature where we can move blocks not just on a day but on weeks. On my daily activities, there are things i cant accomplish on a day and i wanted to move them the nnext day..",1
nice,1
Good! But very few icons,1
How do you get the app to play a voice reminder once you create your schedule? I would like for the app to do a verbal reminder of the time schedules so that we don't always have to look at a screen to see when something needs to be done.,1
It was all great until I found out that it had the first day of the week as Monday!!!! The first day of the week is Sunday!!!! EDIT: It worked. Thanks for responding so quickly!,1
"Love this app, very easy to use BUT i wish there were an easier way to apply templates to calender, like have a certian template (for ex) every wednesday isntead of every 2 days, i have overlapping templates because idk how to do it any other way",1
Pretty great app! Easy to use and helpful. I only wish there was a second widget option showing the current block.,1
"it's a great app, and I love the customization that allows me to quick add repetitive tasks that might not fall on the same day each time. I just really wish they had an app for windows which is where I find planning easiest.",1
"Good app but it needs more work. I gave it four stars because its missing a premium selection, that is an overview of your activities so one can see total time spent on what. This could be in a form of a pie, bar, or line chart. You can include all so we have a choice. With this anyone can now keep track of time spent on a daily activity and limit time spent on said activity. So far good work work guys.",1
"Thank you making this app. I searched a lot for an app like this and this is really unique of this kind especially with voice notifications. But I have few concerns, the schedule dates should be customized to select week days only. The templates are of no use, make routines instead. I'm simply expecting it to be like Google Routines. If you can make it please let me know. I will purchase the premium.",1
"Overall best scheduling app but the only problem that it the reminders does not work (specially when we apply templates in which reminders are already set), which is most important thing for me.",1
"Exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to understand, super clean interface and has all the necessary features even if you don't buy premium. I only have one complain regarding the permanent notification, the most important feature. I would love it if we had more options to customise the permanent notification according to our needs, like option to show title of the task atleast. For now we only see tags which makes it a bit confusing to tell tasks apart. Maybe a task progress bar too.",1
"Great app, very easy to schedule. I think it would be great if there is a button from the notification panel that allows muting of all events for the rest of the day. Another feature could be the user can push forward or backwards the whole timetable (or pushing forward the event and shortening another) from the popup for unexpected event that delays everything",1
great app but annoying to change one time slot to add a few minutes and then you realize you have to change them all. one minor change should adjust the rest. a simple algorithm would suffice? It's not as simple as changing one. The feature is ok in itself but it would be ideal to be able to edit an hour block into one hour and a half (if an activity takes longer than planned) and the activities that lay ahead automatically adjust their timings. This is the real issue everyone has.,1
"Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities.",1
"Wonderful app! Been searching for an app of this kind with a timer/alarm or notification feature whatsoever so I don't need to use a separate alarm to remind me of my schedule for the day. I just hope the notification will work everytime, because most of the time it just doesn't. It doesn't remind me as per the set time/schedule I made in the app. If you can make the notification like that of an alarm, I'd truly appreciate it. Please, please do something about this. Thank you.",1
"A great app for setting routines, simple to use and very customizable. A slight learning curve for the routine setting, eg. The +/- symbols. A few things that could be improved: easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time (from the pro version) or the same routine (from the free version). Also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well. The comment text style could also be better differentiated title/tag of the event.",1
Been looking for an app like this for a while! I love being able to coordinate things with 'tags' customizable by colours AND icons! I would happily give 5 stars apart from three things: 1. It would be great if there was an option to mark tasks as 'completed'; 2. I don't see much of a difference between the 'time block' and 'routine' choices (generally just looking for advice on this one); and 3. It would be great if we could add more than 3 tags to a time block or routine! üòä,1
"Excellent app!! I use it every day. I've got a few small requests though, if possible! Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the ""add this gap to previous/next activity"" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!",1
"This app is brilliant, it's great being able to plan out my entire day. The only thing that I think would make it better is if you could edit/delete individual events that are part of a repeating block or routines. For example if my routine says I have a meeting at this specific time every day but the meeting gets cancelled, it would be useful to be able to delete it for that one day without impacting the others.",1
"Used to love this app, amazing UI, simple. Definitely one of my favourite, and so helpful. This new UI thought, not for me... Too much clutter and scrolling! Tried to get used to it but its not for me, so it's time to let it go. Useful non the less, so try it, maybe it's your thing! Edit: I don't know how to answer so I'll edit and hopefully it gets trough. If I can get something back, I would like the choice to go horizontal (make it a choice on pro). A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did. I liked to scroll horizontal, because I liked the view that it gave me, and the side comparison of days on same level.",1
"Great app, I love the layout and the display of actual time left in between tasks! :) But there are some minor errors. When I try to change start and end time in a block, I can select the hour and the minute, but there is no apply/confirm button, only the cancel button. I can however confirm the time when I randomly tap on the screen, but it takes a couple of times to get it right. Also, the white background color is ok, but maybe pick a more muted one. This shade is quite bright, a bit much.",1
"I like the app, it's easy to use and gives a clear layout. This would be 5 stars if I had the option to mark tasks as done/complete- then if I finish a task ahead of time (or have some extra time) I could check which tasks are still incomplete and get them done. Plus, I love the satisfaction of ticking a box or crossing something off a list- it gives a sense of achievement that helps me to stay motivated and on-track.",1
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,",1
"Loving this app a lot, but it really bugs me that there is no visual of the remaining time left on the widget...you'll have to open the app to see it. Having a widget is a game-changer, but I wish the visual is better, so you can easily see where you are and how much time is left. The only indicator is having the time in bold, but it's not enough. A frame around the current time block or having it highlighted, so you can quickly see, would greatly improve the functionality of the widget.",1
"Its a great app if you want a calender or routine app. I really like the colour coded tags for different types of activities. I would love to see a separate to-do list. I would prefer the to-do list to be separate to the calendar, or have a linking capability so that when you schedule your task into your calender it disappears or you have to choice for it to disappear from the to-do list.",1
"Absolutely adore this app so far and I've barely had it for one day, extremely helpful for someone with adhd and who struggles to prioritize tasks and get things done promptly. The only thing that's keeping me from wanting to raise this to a 5 star review is the fact that the 'voice' feature in notifications doesn't seem to function as expected, it'd be helpful to add a feature to this where either a male or female voice reads out the task title then custom message.",1
"I really love TimeTune in helping me better utilize my time, see where it is all going and plan routine tasks so that I can stay on top of my busy life. The only thing missing for me is the ability to tick things as completed and cross if not done. I'd love to be able to analyze my routine to see what worked well and what I struggled to acheive. I find it rewarding and motivating being able to check things off as done.",1
"Great app! The app offers very interesting and unique features as well . But there is only one problem for people like myself. I spend most of my time doing some work on my laptop, and I try as much as I can to ignore my cellphone whilst working. If only I could manipulate and change my schedule in TimeTune accordingly on my laptop or pc it would be perfect.",1
I really like this app to establish a new routine. I strongly rely on my calendar at work but setting it up for routines outside of work is tedious. At first it takes a moment to understand how repeating activities are set up but now it's a great tool! Feature suggestion: it would be also really great if you could include a habit tracker into the same app.,1
"Overall, this is a great app and the notifications feature is amazing. In my opinion, however, the interface is too big - blocks could be a bit more compact height-wise. They're too big. There could also be a way to set blocks duration by duration - instead of having to set Start and End, just set Start & duration (e.g. 9:30am and 20 minutes). Would also be nice if there were templates of individual blocks, like a block I can easily reuse.",1
"Couldn't recommend this enough to people like me who need easy, quick to make day plans to help avoid procrastination. My only minor complaint is that if I try to extend one of my time blocks and it clashes with what follows it, it gives a warning but there's no easy way to just push everything back together. You have to change each time individually even when I can drag and change the time of over blocks easily, just not when they clash. Fix this and it's a perfect app!!",1
"It's the only app that lets you make templates for schedules, which is great for planning ahead and making adjustments without it being added to your calendar. However, one thing slightly annoys me. Tags are a good & quick way to sort tasks, but the tags icons are way too big and very distracting in contrast to the time on the sides, duration or your description. And it would be great to have an option to choose if you want to use tags at all (one is required at the moment).",1
"Set the Time Management once and forget...thereafter whenever you open the app it will show you what you need to do now at present and how much time elapsed and remaining for the present task, etc. Excellent App but Reminder Alarm most of the time not working so one star reduced.",1
"Good app but id doesn't let me select which google calendar to sync, if I have various. I pretend to use this app por day routine and I usually not use the main calendar for daily routines, instead I created a new one inside my own account. This app won't let me use sync that calendar.",1
"Great when it works, but sometimes fails to update alerts. Have looked at my battery settings, including using don't kill my app instructions, but it doesn't seem to make a difference as the error occurs randomly.",1
"I like this a lot, but for whatever reason there is a glitch with the Template putting duplicates whenever I add them to new days. I thought I had accidentally added the same agenda item twice but the template itself looks normal. It's only when I add it to a day.",1
"Really love this app, but an addition I would love is having the option to have the persistent notification not show during free time (unscheduled time). That way it doesn't get in the way when I'm not scheduled to be doing anything. As it is now I have to turn off persistent notification everytime I'm done working for the day and turn it back on when I go to bed.",1
Really great system and something Ive been looking for a while. Would have been perfect if the Calendar events were part of the statistics.,1
"It's a good app and being able to route alerts through different sound channels is a great idea. I've found a bug though and couldn't find a way to contact you about it besides here: It's daylight savings today and while timetune has the correct time, for some reason it has pushed forward all my events by one hour. So an event which says it is happening at 6:30 is now on my timeline as 7:30. Hopefully its just for today.",1
"(The ability to save different schedules and just toggle each or all of them is perfect. Have some seasonal schedules that I can just turn on or off as required, while keeping other routine schedules"":This is what i most liked! Liked a lot how practical it was (that's the reason for having it) it fited all my scheduling needs, it differed this app from any other. Thank you so much for the fast response.",1
"Would be perfect if: - You could update cloned activities, meaning if you changed one all of them would change too - You could check off the activities like a to do list (it works as a reward system) - You could scroll up in your timetable to see what you did that day/things you missed because it only shows everything from that point in time forwards. Otherwise really love the design and layout, and it makes me super organised.",1
"Really helpful app. I've looked at lots of other schedule apps, but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely. Great for making routines! Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.",1
"could be more intuitive. but as it is, it's good, deserves a solid 4-5 stars as is.",1
I will like one more option in settings -> calendar sync -> [checkbox] push events to google calendar ... I know it's not good to receive notifications from two places but on galaxy phones always on display shows only events that are listed in google calendar or samsung calendar app and I really like my schedule on always on display screen... please do it this will help all galaxy users.,1
"Easiest interface to track time. love the app ‚ù§Ô∏è please introduce the feature of randomly arranging tags according to our preference instead of alphabetically. And more colour palettes for people who have paid for premium other than just light and dark themes , like beige or other pastel colours..4 stars because of the lack of these features. Otherwise perfect!",1
"I have purchased the premium version of time tune application because of it's simplicity and the most amazing feature which I like is the ability to set a note which speaks out to remind you the task. But these days i am facing issues with these feature, because of which I am not able to get my work schedule right. I request the development team to kindly look into this. thankyou",1
"This app is super useful to keep me scheduled. I only have the free version, but it's still really useful. I like how it looks and how I can look at how much time I put into certain activities. I also like how I can set multiple notifications for the same activity. You can also change each individual notification however you want. The app is very user friendly. I would definitely recommend üëç",1
"This app is effective for scheduling my day - especially with the block system. I love the various features such as the tags and day summaries. To make this app replace my whole schedule I would appreciate being able to ""complete"" a block. Even a simple fade of colour, strikethrough of the text or tick would suffice. Since my schedule doesn't always go to plan this feature would really help me see what I've managed to get through today and what's left.",1
"After installing and uninstalling several other apps I finally found this one and it suits my needs the best. I like the appearance and all the features. There are two things I'm missing however - subtasks and the possibility to tick off every single completed task or event for the specific day. This would make this app a perfect tool for me and I wouldn't mind to pay for it. As a busy mom battling depression I need a simple tool to help me to organise my day and week, and to remember my tasks.",1
"Very satisfied with the app, helps me arranging my day and getting an overview at the end of day. There is still a bug though, after I deleted some blocks, they still appear in the statistics for this certain day/month and even year. How can I get rid of this? But overall very likely to recommend this app!",1
"I just tried this app and I am already compelled to buy the premium version. I think this app has many potential, please make more simple UI so that when we're looking at timeline it doesn't feel so cluttered. A minimal look will be so much better. Look forward to more addition to the app and more great features.",1
I wish to buy the pro version and also encourage my friends and family to do the same but hope you can make some improvements to the app. The UI looks very minimal which is a vanilla android template for an app development. Please make the UI a bit more appealing. We would have also like to do routines that are repeated in intervals of more than 15 days. Present app doesn't allow me to set a monthly routine. Hope the icons can be more rich and appealing.,1
"I'm really enjoying this app so far, love how it's very customizable and will show you how much time you have inbetween each time block (if any). The only thing that I would love to be fixed, is when you want to change the start and end time of a block. You have to change the time, then change the time of EVERY other time block you have so there is no over lap. It would be awesome if you could hold the block you want and move it (up or down) to the time you want and the other blocks will adjust",1
"Okay so far as I have used, the app was pretty good. I read that this is s new one, and I like all the features present in it. However there is still lot of room for improvement. I have a small suggestion to make, you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not. That way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the Timetable :)",1
"Edit: I use comments to add reminders about what I'm specifically planning to do to complete each task day by day, like grocery lists and assignment titles. I would really like to be able to add comments for just one cycle of the routine and have them disappear after the week restarts. I thought it might be useful to have this function on the timeline page rather than the routine edit screen, which seems to only be useful for permanent comments. I hope this makes sense!",1
"I am premium user. Plz add instant backup & backup interval choosing option , so that we can instantly continue on other gadget simultaneously.",1
"Custom ringtones don't work. App instantly crashes if you attempt put custom ringtones. Also, the current ringtones are either too small ( like 1 sec) or continuous so if you don't have your phone with you the ringtone will keep on going. Just won't stop automatically and there's no option to set ringtone duration Update- the solution worked. Thanks",1
"This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves.",1
"I miss the timer function, please put it back. Reply to Developer's suggestion for a new pomodoro timer: Unless it's markedly better than the hundreds of timer apps available in the store and at a more competitive price, I wouldn't consider a new timer app from you. As it stands now, I've held back from upgrading to the revamped version on one of my phones as it takes away functions including the timer, a feature that makes the old app stand out and superior to the deluge of other similar apps",1
"May not be best experience for free user like me, but it is an excellent app.",1
"This app is great!!! From a students perspective I love how you can make different schedules, like one for this and one for that. It's so easy and user friendly, I ‚ù§ it. One thing they should add is a way that I can access this app with my schedules on both my phone and tablet without having to copy out the entire schedule again. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",1
"It is a good app, but two improvements could make it great: 1. Count down on each task. It would really help to focus and speed up if necessary. 2. Option for ticking the done tasks. In case if something went different than expected it would be easier to come back to undone tasks (and it just feels good to tick the done task ;)",1
"I like this app a lot. One thing that stops me from buying pro version is that I desparately need it to export routines to my Google calendar (now I think that it is just possible from Google calendar to TimeTune). That is because the interface of TimeTune is much, much better than Google calendar interface, and I need all my routines in Google calendar in order to sync it with my Google Home speaker, so it can read it out loud every time I ask and remind me even without my phone.",1
"This apps quite easy to use and looks simple. Just it doesn't really meet my requirements, it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox. I've purchased it but it still like the same. It said sync to my calendar but it didn't shows what I've planned in my google calendar. The only thing I am satisfield is the notification sounds.",1
"I just got the premium version. But I wish I could drag and release blocks to change the order easily. Also I wish there was a easier way to change when time events starts and ends rather than manually change the time block by block. For example be able to mark multible blocks and make it later or earlier, or make a block longer/shorter by dragging it up or down somehow and make the blocks before and after change accordingly. Will this be possible in the future? Otherwise I love the app.",1
It's a good app for organizing yourself and easy to use. I myself really like routines section and use it much. Its widget is perfect so that you can see what are you exactly going to do. Blocks are useful as well. But sometimes there is need to a to-do list and there are some activities that Don't have an exact time. I'd be pleased if you add this section. Thanks for the greatest time organizing I've ever seen and continue improving it.,1
"I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications.",1
One of the cleanest UI's I might have ever used. I understand that the app is made for us to be able to stick to our schedules! But I think it's a shame they're not letting us double it's use as a time log too! I think the statistics can be made more informative like graphical representations and stuff. And we should also be given an option to just log in our schedules day after day without using the routines function because I have different schedules everyday!,1
This app is absolutely perfect it really helped with my adhd brain lol. I downloaded it a year ago and then I totally forgot about it until now. The only things I'd recommend are having a task list feature and a little more variety in themes. But it's not really that necessary the app in itself is very good. I wish you a good continuation!,1
"It is an interesting app and I love it, because I will plan my day and get the control of time. But it will be great if you sync the calendar to the device calanders. For example I want to use sectigraph app along your app to see my schedule. But when I click on the calenders in sectograph my TimeTune calendar is not available it will be great if you sync time tune calender to device calenders...",1
"I have the premium version, it's a good app, but lacking in features. Some things I would like 1) Ability to share schedules with other people 2) Better statistics function, measuring for an arbitrary amount of days forward or back. 3) Ability to input whether the activity was done or not for better reflection (not following your schedule is quite common)",1
"My own structuring of little tasks and routines improves with this app. I really like the app, but I would also like it on my laptop. It would be great if you developed an option to install and use it on both devices, as I don't always have my phone on me while working. Or did I miss something? It doesn't allow me to install the app on my laptop, it only shows that it is already installed on my phone.  Looking forward to your response. Thanks in advance!",1
"this application is so neat with the color differentiation in each of the category and very helpful to remind me to do something. the thing that i don't get from this app is a long vibration for when the reminder is ringing (it's limited, 5 vibrations only for the maximum). it makes me have to turn on my alarm, for example to remind me to get up early.",1
"I just got the premium version. But I wish I could drag and release blocks to change the order easily. Also I wish there was a easier way to change when time events starts and ends rather than manually change the time block by block. For example be able to mark multible blocks and make it later or earlier, or make a block longer/shorter by dragging it up or down somehow and make the blocks before and after change accordingly. Will this be possible in the future? Otherwise I love the app.",1
"I'm not sure if this does what I want. The premium version may, but not enough description. I want to make a daily goal to do something for 1 hour every day (5 minutes here, 20 minutes there, Keeping time with a stopwatch rather than hard scheduled) and see how well I do over time. I like the look, but I'm going to scout around for something to try before I buy. I appreciate that you don't collect/share data, so that's the reason for the extra star.",1
Wish it would have a checklist also,1
"This app is wonderful. I use it every day now. It really helps organizing time and maximize my productivity. I only wish that there's an option where I could ""adjust"" an entire routine. I already have this perfectly planned routine but sometimes I need to adjust my time. for example I need to wake up earlier but i still want to do the same routine. instead of changing the time one by one i could just ""adjust"" it as a whole.",1
"Have been enjoying this app, as other users have said it's great to be able to glance at my phone to see what I'm supposed too be doing to get back in track, really quick and useful way to plan out your day. Few quality of life improvements that I would like to see, the ability to upload custom Icons for tags, A color wheel as an option as well as the standard preset colors A way to interact with the statistics to see how many hours per week/month/year (this could exist but I haven't found it)",1
"I deleted my original review, but still highly recommend this app and loving it still... at this rate I doubt I'll ever change to a different app... I've tried other apps too but this one gave me a lot of room for customization while keeping the UI simple to understand... often a difficult balance to keep. I bought the pro version as well and consider it well worth the investment, especially after familiarizing myself with it as much as I have.",1
"Notifications stopped working after the last update but going to Settings > Apps > TimeTune > Battery > Battery Optimization and setting the app to ""Not Optimized"" did the trick for me. I know every Android version/manufacturer has slightly different settings but maybe this will help some of you. Basically you have to manually ""whitelist""/unoptimize the app so your phone won't automatically kill it. Overall great app. Helps me stay productive and on track during the day.",1
"The best time management app I have ever used!! I had purchased the pro version and I have been using for quite some time. Recently, I had changed my phone and moved to iOS. Unfortunately, TimeTune is not available for iOS :-( Which is very very disappointing. I didn't find any app on iOS which is as good and simple as TimeTune. So, Pleeeeeease, release a version for iOS devices.",1
"The app is amazing, I have used it for quite a while. However, there have been troubles with the widget: sometimes it doesn't display the events at all, and it stopped refreshing automatically, so when it does display events, you gotta refresh it all the time manually. Please, let me know if I should provide more information about it. Thank you in advance! UPD: Added 1 more star for your comment with the solution to this problem. Thank you so much!",1
"Been using this app since 2016. Decided it was long over due to go premium and support you guys. Lol. I love that you guys constantly improve it. I wanted to ask if it's possible to change the text colour on the interface. Like how you change the text colour on the widget. Maybe put that feature in? (Like if I change the theme to black, I'd like to have the option of changing the text to white instead of having it grey. It's just easier to see against the black) Also... something that let's you know that certain tags use certain colours. (Like maybe the number 3 is displayed over blue to show that 3 tags use that colour) It gets confusing at a later stage when you have a lot of tags and you don't want the same colours to repeat on consecutive tasks. I'm also red green colour blind so I get super confused, lol. But I think a lot of people would think that could be a nice feature. Another feature that would be awesome would be to have separate routines in separate widgets. As oppose to 2 routines just combining in to one awkward list on a single widget. Granted, this is situational. Anyway, thanks!",1
"I paid for this app, not because of the premium features but rather because it is the app I've been waiting for and I would like to support the creators, who don't even restrict the abilities of free users. This app is perfect for anyone like myself, who is searching for a simple app with an easy interface, simple schedule setting capabilities and the ability to set a repeated routine. Cheers, creators. One of few apps I've been proud to pay for.",1
This app is a lifesaver for feeling less overwhelmed and scattered. I felt like I was running behind lately and now I have a great visual of what's coming up and I'm much better able to plan without cluttering my main calendar,1
I just want to let you know guys that this is the world best time management software for student.. I'm a premium user and i have been using the software for the past one year.,1
"Awsome & Creative app! , the team has really put thought into creating it, they have included even the progress bar, that's unique.",1
I am RARE to review anything but this app takes the cake of my approval. I have executive function and attention issues so I find colors and ads overwelming on most apps leaving me irritated and discouraged from using most apps out there but this one has no pop up unless I want them. I highly recommend if you need to start a routine or habit and need a simplistic format this is the best app for your structure struggling needs. Bonus is the low ONE time price in which I bought it for.,1
Excellent app to help you organize your schedule. Simple and practical.,1
"The BEST daily routine/schedule app BY FAR. You can make totally different templates for different kinds of days (gym days, rest days, school-days, any kind of day basically) and add alarms to the tasks that ring EVEN IF YOU ARE ON DND!!! (The app can just straight up override DND) The lay out is super intuitive and simple and you can save tasks as well as templates, this app is just a 10/10 honestly.",1
"Best app to keep me organized and stick to my routine. I love how it has categories. It was easy to navigate. What I love most about TimeTune is its voice notification feature because some simple buzzes don't work on me. I personalize my voice notifs (like, ""Hey, stop working and have a rest!""), which makes the app ten times better than other apps. And their dev team is responsive! They respond on both email and Reddit. Such great customer service. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"I have been looking for routine planners and things to plan my day or week for years. And this app actually offers me everything I need, like I can decide for myself which gets an notification, and selecting the tasks by categories, giving me a better oversight on how much hours I have spent on studying for example. I will try premium soon too, but without it is actually doing its job well too. Thank you!",1
Great app for organization and seeing where your time goes. I love that they brought back having days on separate screens to swipe across. I bought the pro version to support this company for making the best time management app I've come across! Thank you timetune. Keep up the great work. Edit: I don't like that in the new update the statistics don't show the percentages of how much time you spend in one tag. Can you bring that back??,1
"I've tried almost every other routine oriented app and TimeTune crushes everything. If I had one wish, I'd love to see customizable checklists within activities to check off each completed task that makes up the activity. But then I'd have no excuse for not getting things done.",1
"This app is amazing for for giving my day structure and purpose mostly because the templates are so easy to use. I had an old 4 star review cuz I didnt know how to adjust the time ofthe blocks after I applied the template(you press the left side of the block) But there is still one thing I dont know how to do or maybe its a bug but when I apply a template and delete all the blocks to try and apply another template, I cant apply templates to that day anymore. Besides that small issue, 10/10.",1
"I just set up my daily calendar and totally loving this app! It's easy to use, you can set up reminders, tags, templates, blocks, etc. I even set up reminders 5 mins after each reminder so I don't ignore them. I'm hoping the audible notifications work, and that it will be easy on the battery. So far, I give it a 5/5!",1
I use this app almost every day. as someone with anxiety (and someone who struggles counting hours) this saves me so much worry and stress. I put my daily routines in here and know exactly how many hours I have between activities. it's super simple to operate too and is just a great app overall. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.,1
"I seriously love this app. Being an extremely forgetful perfectionist is a frustrating oxymoron, but this app is an awesome solution. I can plan my entire day easily with this app. I'm the type of person who forgets to eat and take medicine, but not anymore thanks to this app! The interface is also very slick and aesthetically pleasing. Thank you for this app!",1
"This app has been life changing for me. I'm getting out of my funk and taking better care of myself. I have my own personal daily soundtrack! I would like to know if there's a way to turn off the sound coming out of my phone speaker while earbuds are connected, so I don't have to annoy everyone else with my personal soundtrack üòÜ. I live in a multigenerational household, and there's already enough noise going on!",1
I just came back from a year or more of not using the app (I didn't really have a routine) and I've gotta say the design changes are amazing. It's visually easier to navigate and edit. The ideas in blocks are great. Can't wait to see you implement more things to do with overlaps and such.,1
It's hard for me to find a scheduling app that I stick to as a person with terrible ADHD. Time tune has always been consistently the app that keeps me the most in focus. I especially like the clean widget that doesn't let me forget what I'm supposed to be doing and what I'm going to be doing next.,1
"I've only had this for a couple hours or so, but I can say that, without a shadow of doubt, this is the best time management app that I have come across. Paid for premium almost immediately and I can say that it was a valuable purchase. Just wish I could remove portions of a single day when everything else is a routine. Could probably do it with the programming feature, but it's a minor addition that I'd personally like to see. Keep up the amazing work!",1
"Even with the free version, this has been the single most useful organizational tool in my arsenal period, with Google Calendar coming in second. If one is at all I interested in having full customizability and overstanding view of all available time scheduling in order to truly maximize efficiency, I highly recommend this application. Namast√© üôè",1
"It was great at first, it really helped me get my stuff done. But now, every 2 or so days, it stops sending me notifications so I go and refresh the background tasks, it works again for a couple days but then it happens again. Could you please tell me how to fix this? Other than that it's a great app üíñ Edit: I fixed the problem, the app is perfect now",1
"This application got me through one of the most difficult semesters of my college career. With working a full-time job alongside being a full time student, I felt more than a bit overwhelmed and I couldn't manage my time effectively. I found this app and it not only helped me set up a regular study/homework schedule, but also allowed me to find free time I didn't know I had. The app was flexible and easy to understand, and the reminders were very useful in keeping me on schedule",1
"This app has a great combination of productivity and organizer functions. The IU is easy to navigate and well designed. I do have one wish. Add an option to check off tasks as I go, to record how well I complied with my routines over time. eg; I set am/pm meditation times into my routine. Let me check a box, on the widget, indicating that I did the actual meditation. Then I would be able to see in the stats a comparison of time allocated to it Vs Time actually doing it.",1
"Since I linked it with a smart watch I've been able to make the most out of everyday, which is huge since I used to do nothing due to indecision. I've scheduled time for both professional stuff, self-improvement and working through my backlog of movies and games. Super easy to use too, and good backup support (I switched phones and all my routines were imported). Solid app.",1
"Amazing amazing app. All the organisation I could ever need in one place. App allows flexible creation of a regular schedule on either a weekly or fortnightly basis but allows special events, reminders and even little notes on the schedule. On top of it all, it is easy to learn, efficient and has a sleek design. Highly highly recommend to anyone who wants to keep track of their productivity.",1
"Love the app for time blocking! I can choose to set an alarm or not with enough options like sound, vibrating (how long and how many) etc. It looks clean and has the right options. Pro only gives you another feature it is totally usable without pro. You are doing great work, thanks developers! Probably gonna get pro to support them. And it has a dark theme option!üñ§",1
"This app is amazing, I love routines but can never stick to them but somehow this has really helped me. I love how you can save difference routines by making templates, all my routines are always made as templates and it's helped me so much. One suggestion could there be a way to delete a whole day of routine instead of just individually deleting each activity? I think that would be really helpful. Overall I love this app and I would highly recommend.",1
"I LOVE this app. I use voice notifications because my phone tells me what I need to do and that helps a lot. The timetable is easy to use, has a great look, and I love the tags and the ability to create my own. Since making my timetable, I've stuck to it which is great because every task or habit app I've used hasn't made me do anything differently. This has. I use the free version, and that is perfect for me. Highly recommended for sure!",1
"Love this app. I can reuse days, but my schedule is pretty chaotic for that right now. It definitely helps organize my time - and priorities, with super easy add on buttons, and a description section for extra notes. Love the simplicity, love the colour coding option. I've honestly never had more productive days üëç A must for the busy people of the world.",1
"UPDATED REVIEW: I've been using this app for many years and just when I thought it couldn't get any better, along comes version 4.0!! Using templates is so much more intuitive and you can now have overlapping blocks...finally!! TimeTune is incredibly useful, reliable and is constantly developed. I highly recommended it.",1
"I have been looking for the perfect schedule planning app, and I think I just found it! This app is perfect! It has different tags, events, and you can even add your daily/weekly routines! I can't describe how much I love this app. The best part is, everything is free! You can purchase the Pro Version, which I highly reccomend you do! Download NOW!",1
"Best app ever, 100% recommended One thing, I would add timezones. Perfect for the whole world. As a citizen from this planet, we have friends and clients all over the planet. We do a lot of online meetings. We arrange the appointments with the blocks. Thank you, for such a great app. At a local level, we teach and recommend your app. Just to organize life! It works.",1
"Absolutely amazing app! Not only does it help me see what I have planned for the day, how long I have planned for it, and stay on track but it's also simple and easy to use. Ads don't get in the way of app functionality, the interface is clean and not overcomplicated. Definitely one of the better planning/time management apps out there",1
"It's great for organizing and scheduling our time. It's smooth, efficient and resourceful. For all the features it does have, I'd give 5 stars and i did. But i would love it if it also had the option to review past schedules, like ticking or crossing out the activities on the routine that we did or did not complete. This would allow the user to evaluate how disciplined they are or how workable their schedule is.",1
"""You've got a really cool app! I'd love it if you could add a feature where it automatically calculates the time from the start until, let's say, 57 minutes later. That would be awesome!"" ""Sometimes when I want to schedule a time, the start time might be like 7:36. The next task I want to schedule in the program might take 43 minutes. If it could automatically calculate when 43 minutes later would be, that would be great",1
"Great for uni and work, means I can allocate tasks and forget about them until they pop up which reduces stress/anxiety. Maybe some cool new notification sounds that were a bit louder than the original ones, and putting in one task and being able to make it across mon-fri instead of having to do it individually for each day, cabt wait to see new developments too :D",1
"‚óè 2019-10-15 EDIT: Just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem I initially encountered seems to have gone away. I don't know exactly when, or how (maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or Android), but TimeTune notifications now happen reliably and on time, just as you would expect, so I'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars‚Äîbig thanks to the devs! ‚óè 2018-11-05 EDIT: Already in touch with support and testing. After restarting my device it appears to be working, but I will need to test for a few days before I can confirm ‚óè INITIAL REVIEW: App itself is great, but Android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity. As a result, notifications don't happen. I've followed the troubleshooting steps which I was already familiar with and have worked for other apps. just not for TimeTune. I wish I could fix this, it's such a great app!",1
The best useful feature of this app for me is it gives an account of how much time you have left for the day. As to my obsessive-compulsive perfectionist planner self I love to note what I do for that specific period time of the day down to every second. This feature totally helped me the best. Adding the minimalist and clean look. The best application for time planning.,1
"Super duper amazing app. I absolutely love that it notifies it at right time with a pop up window along with voice also. It's the perfect app I was looking for my study schedule. Thank you to the team for making such an efficient app. Also the pro version is very very affordable. Routine schedule is very flexible too, I can disable any one of the routine. Very commendable feature for me though.",1
"Absolutely Amazing, exactly what I've been looking for!!! The only improvement I can think about is allowing us to see our timeline in a calendar view... pretty please??? The visual would really help me with time blocking. Other than that, I'm very happy! I bought premium pretty much straight away (which I never do!)",1
"Been hunting for an app like this for literal weeks and this is hands down my fav of all! Super trimmed down layout for easy use + function, able to switch entire schedules with 2 clicks at most, customizable notifications down to adjusting the base default, easy to use + modify colored tags - overall perfect for my needs!! Plus the day summary helps a lot in actually understanding how much time is going where which is something I struggle with big time, but can now adjust accordingly!! :))",1
"I've been using this app for the past 4 years now, and I must say, this new UI update was the single biggest improvement that I've ever experienced in an app. The new tag system simplifies everything, and it looks so much better. I'd always struggled with giving a block of time multiple equally important activites, but the new design caters for it upfront. It may sound really small, but it used to be the most annoying part of the experience for me, and now it's my favorite thing about the app!",1
"After trying tens of apps, online services and methods, I can say that TimeTune is one of the best solutions in the market. It's flexible, user-friendly and minimal. Maybe the only thing that could have made it either better was to have an web interface...or ability to sync with more than two email accounts (e.g. Gmail, Outlook). Nevertheless I'll by the premium version :) - good job guys",1
"Thanks, amazing. Took a little while to figure out how routine worked with program, but I think I understand it now. Love how you can tweak everything and integrate it into the homescreen background. Love the icons in de bar as an option. Really useful, but non intrusive app. Good value for money. Would absolutely recommend it for anyone who thinks Google calander lacks a few functions or is really bad at organizing or routines.",1
"Great App for daily planning. I have one thing to ask for. Could you implement a function where you see the remaining time until the next task? For example it's currently 15:15 and the next task starts 16:00, so the time in-between displayed is 45 minutes and decreases with the current real time. You recommend this app to people with trouble planning and I think such a function would make it much more easy for people without a good sense for time. Otherwise it's a great App, intuitive and easy!",1
"The app is great, but it only misses a major feature, if it has it; it will be #1 plannings app. The ability to make plans according to specific days of the week, like I have routine that only occurs at Wednesdays and Thursdays, but the rest of the week, I have different routines to assign to each day. It would be amazing to have this feature! Edit: Found it! Didn't know how I missed it. For me it's #1 plannings app now!",1
"This app is the best I've found at organising my time, especially useful to set different routines for different work pattern schedules. I bought premium so I can program this all in seamlessly. Some additions I would like is to add notes or check lists to my tasks. For example under ""eating"" I'd like a comment such as ""spaghetti"" which deletes every day and checklist so when I set time for ""cleaning"" I know what tasks I have to get done. But overall an excellent app.",1
"F***ing love this app! I have been looking for an app that lets me keep all of my plans and daily routines in one place and works as well as this. It was getting to the point where I was going to program my own app :/ It has a tone of customizability, it you're like me and your very obsessive with how you use your time it lets you feed that and after many failed attempts to better organize my life this is doing the best job so far.",1
"I like the program a lot. It helps you realize how much time is wasted during the day, how long routine tasks actually take. One thing I want to warn you about: I added daily wakeup time as a reminder -I think- not definitely sure. It is recorded in standard Android calendar. I re-installed the OS, now I can't delete 365 x reminders for daily wake up time. I'm still searching for a way.",1
"I never rate apps but I have to rate this one. I've been looking for a time planner app where you can create a routine once and use it on a daily basis. It also provides a weekly /monthly basis and you can choose if you want to repeat it after how many days e.g. every after 2 days. There's a calendar and a statistics feature that's going to track your habit. There's tags for easy reading. Pop up notifications. I could go on but I'd reach the limit, so go on and get this app. It's THEE best.",1
"Took it yesterday and it is exactly what I was looking for. If you have an idea of how you want to manage your time and need something to help you change your focus to the next thing in your plan so you won't lose track of time, this app will make everything much easier, being able even to overlap atypical routines to normal one. Only took pro version to support the good work as they already give all the necessary options in free version. ++ And it works great, no bugs, no major issues",1
"This is a fun and exceptional app for scheduling routine actions. You can also schedule non routine events too. If I had any quibbles, it's that it would be nice to make edits within the schedule for the day I'm on without having to adjust a whole saved routine day. Also, the emoji options could be more expansive (they're pretty good as it is, though). Otherwise, it's an excellent app!",1
"I have never written a review for an app before but I feel I want to give my feedback to the developers of TimeTune and for anyone considering downloading it for a routine planner. I have never been so impressed by an app. It works so smoothly, the UI is amazing. The customisation options are great. The style/design. The statistics presented to you so you can analyse and change things around in your routine is just a phenomenally useful and an ingenious idea to have there. Everything is just easy and works. I was so impressed when I was setting up my routine, my life, it was like a dream to work with. I cannot recommend this app enough. The developers seem to have delved in to my brain and pulled out exactly the kind of thing that I have always searched for all my life. I can finally say goodbye to the days of trying to organise my life with Excel spreadsheets or having a mini breakdown trying to edit routines on Google calendar without a headache and finally giving up. With TimeTune the details, the functionality, the style, everything, down to the great widget customisation, just... simple, elegant, intuitive, perfect. To the guys/gals who have made this, wherever you are, I shake your hand. Well done on making such an amazing product. All the best for the future - you're going places. As for this app - don't change things too much!!! Tl;dr Everybody should have this app.",1
"I've been using this app for a few years. It's changed since I first got it, but only ever in the right direction. I bought the premium version and honestly it's such a big help. I struggle with adhd and stuff like this is (not necessarily timetune alone, but it's my ideal app). Even without premium it was A+, but I decided it was worth the investment. Devs have also been very helpful when I had a syncing issue in the past (responded from reddit lol! kind initiative!). I definitely recommend.",1
"Fantastic app. Best time blocking solution for Android I've found. They also don't lock you out of the most essential features when the free version, which I have a ton of respect towards the devs for choosing to do. I'm able to backup schedules, create multiple variations and do everything else I need without issue. It's laid out to be easy to use and visually appealing as well. Highly recommend.",1
"So far I've found this app incredibly useful. Perfect to schedule morning routines or study plans etc. Exactly what I've been looking for. There is an option to buy a pro version which I am considering, but it is not forced as the app functions well without it. I've been working on turning my life around and it's been really helpful. Definitely recommended. I hope this helps xx",1
"This is a very good app, when compared to others of this type. However, I think all of them, including this one, lack flexibility in adjusting the schedule. I'd like to edit my daily schedule by editing the start of my day, adding breaks in between, extending activities. If my new activity clashes with another, just move it. I don't want to edit manually every activity.",1
"I have remote learners and this app is so helpful when keeping track of their school schedule. Highly recommended. I have the free version so I'm not sure if the pro version allows you to designate a specific routine within a specific date within a calendar app, but I can import a specific routine per day with the free version and it's been very useful.",1
"I love this app. I experience a serious issue with feeling or noticing the passage of time thanks to good old depression and anxiety issues, so having a programmable nag like this is amazingly helpful. You can even customize specific sounds for certain activities so you don't even need to look to know what it is reminding you to do. I bet if I would throw a normal calender into the fairy spring from Zelda I'm reasonably sure it would come out as a smart phone with this app installed.",1
"Amazing! This is exactly what I was looking for. I don't need a to-do list. I need an app that will tell me what I should be doing NOW and remind me when it's time to switch tasks or take a break. The widget is really attractive, and the basic features are super intuitive. But the more complex, optional features also add a lot of customization options for people who like to tinker. 10 out of 10 Would definitely recommend",1
"Simple, awesome UI. I love it so far. It would be good if there was a option to reset or remove all plans.",1
Room for improvements: 1. The daily schedule should be able to size in and out to make it as 1 page for whole daily plan review 2. The interface division include customs hours to choose for instance from 6a.m to 11p.m,1
"Great app, but in notification and pop-up it is only showing start time like ""task starting now and start time"" please add more details in notification like when it's starting how many minutes it is and when it will end.",1
"Looks good so far. The repeat feature needs a ""weekday only"" option.",1
"Exactly what I needed! Working from home is tough, and having stretches of unstructured time can be daunting. I like set different productivity times and meal times to look forward to. And reminders to do my skincare ofc. The widget needs some changes... I'd like it if the tags were able to sit side by side instead of stacking vertically, so the block looks like one item and less like a confusing list of words and tags. Maybe display symbols of tags only and adding divisions?",1
it is worth downloading üî•‚ö°,1
"Me encantar√≠a que los bloques se muestren en el calendario dado a que se ven en la agenda , pero la agenda s√≥lo se ve por d√≠a y no por semana, y tengo que usar la plantilla para agregar al calendario . No entiendo en si para que sirve el bloque si al final no se ev en el calendario. Otro es cuando use el template en el nombre de la agenda solo aparece la etiqueta y no el nombre q se puso en el template eso dificulta al momento de ver q actividad tengo si uso etiquetas iguales",1
"Love the app I think it would be way better if youd get notified for a task, the alarm only goes off if you're on the app which defeats the purpose..",1
-100k for lifetime -No way to mark time block as done -Meh UI for the timeline / time block,1
"Changed from 1 star to 4 now. It is one of kind atm in PlayStore. If you play voice for notifications, you cannot hear the first couple of words as both notification sound and voice start at the same time. A major update I would want is to have sub tasks/activities withan activity. Currently, I have to create multiple activities atm. Since it is Tag focused, the Tags can have multiple editable sub-Tags.",1
it really needs a desktop version to use at work and sync with MS products. then it would be perfect.,1
Too complicated Too plain Idk I just didn't like the idea,1
"This app is great. The reminders work and the customization is great. As someone with ADHD, this is super helpful in my daily routine. The only thing that would make this app better is if each entry was treated as a task, with a ""Mark as Complete"" button in the notification, allowing you to mark it as done. For people that rely on the satisfaction of marking something as done, this would be extremely helpful and satisfying. Dopamine on tap.",1
Very great app but I request you to add an optional alarm for reminding. Else all works great and I love this...,1
"Overall, this is a great app and the notifications feature is amazing. In my opinion, however, the interface is too big - blocks could be a bit more compact height-wise. They're too big. There could also be a way to set blocks duration by duration - instead of having to set Start and End, just set Start & duration (e.g. 9:30am and 20 minutes). Would also be nice if there were templates of individual blocks, like a block I can easily reuse.",1
"This is the exact app that I really need as a student. I can organise my time in detailed ü´∂. Also, the tag function is such a brainy idea. Whoever creates this app, I hope you have the best life everü´µüèªü´µüèª. Free app always have ad - but I'm so grateful that the ad doesn't pop up randomly like the other appüíÄ",1
I loved your app but I have 1 suggestion right not to make your UI/UX more better. Please tell me where should I send the details.,1
"Amazing app, I'll give it 4 stars as it still has a lot of potential when it comes to UI and additional features",1
I like and use this app the most out of the other apps I've tried but this app doesn't have two key features that would help anyone be more productive. 1. There is no way to drag timeblocks to move them to different times in the day for easy schedule changes. 2. A feature that lets me tap any time in the day and place in previously made time blocks. (i.e. have a place to store more permanent timeblocks) Both are Big deal breakers (I almost Didn't use the app) PS. Please add custom themes .,1
"This app would be a 1000x times better IF you could push any templatea you have FORWARD or BACKWARDS x amount of time. Otherwise? You have to put it in manually. Sleep in? Too bad, enjoy 5-10mins of rearranging everything EACH TIME. Please add this simple feature in, I've bought the paid version and its amazing but please, add this feature.",1
Full of bugs it repeatedly creat on block when ever I try to creat new after so mauch effort it damages all the tasks. Don't‚õîÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è,1
"App has been useful and i like the design and features. I am finding blocks really confusing. What is the purpose of the blocks tab? I would love to be able to create individual premade blocks with a description, tags, notification settings and duration but be able to click on the calendar and choose from a list of these blocks rather than making a new one every time. I cant seem to find a way to do that without templates currently. Would this be a possibility? Thanks.",1
"I purchased the premium version but I have a problem with this app. Why can I only see statistics of 1 month ahead of me and not more than that. For example I have created a schedule for three months starting from Feb, so I should be able to see statistics of Feb-march-april. But I am only able to see until March. Why is it so?",1
"It's the only app that lets you make templates for schedules, which is great for planning ahead and making adjustments without it being added to your calendar. However, one thing slightly annoys me. Tags are a good & quick way to sort tasks, but the tags icons are way too big and very distracting in contrast to the time on the sides, duration or your description. And it would be great to have an option to choose if you want to use tags at all (one is required at the moment).",1
"Fantastic app, the only problem i have is your can only add 3 tags to one thing wish it was more",1
usefull,1
Well Sound feature is not working at all.,1
"Very satisfied with the app, helps me arranging my day and getting an overview at the end of day. There is still a bug though, after I deleted some blocks, they still appear in the statistics for this certain day/month and even year. How can I get rid of this? But overall very likely to recommend this app!",1
"this app is very good for time management, ringtone not given free subscriptioners ,& also notification.",1
App is good but not useful for free users. Atleast graph of week and month should be available for free.,1
"El √∫nico problema que considero tiene la aplicaci√≥n es no poder ver en el calendario m√°s de un mes en adelante, incluso la versi√≥n paga no permite esta opci√≥n.",1
"Its simple and straight to the point I am loving this app! Though, I do have problems that the app widget does not update unless I open the app and other similar shenanigans. I would also love to see a loading bar instead in the persistent notifications, if that's possible it just would look really cool. Anyways, thanks, and if I have money to spare I'd buy your premium options. Cheers!",1
9 JJ,1
Really very good user experience,1
"[Pretty damn good app] Due to an injury, I struggle with memory. After picking this app up, and using its widget, it's been way easier to schedule out my day to day. I've also just recently moved into trying to get some muscle back. I've got every minute of the day calculated with this app, ive got notifications for reminding myself to eat, get in the gym, etc. Dope app, good job devs",1
"I installed it a couple days ago and I like it well enough so far. I do need to track down a louder notification tone for it so I can hear it at work (constant loud machinery running), and it did take me a little bit to get the hang of how it works (a beginner's tutorial wouldn't be amiss, a quick 2-minute tour would probably be plenty) but I think I've got it pretty much figured out now and it's been more helpful than any other personal planning apps I've tried out.",1
"Great schedule keeping app. A small learning curve to learn how the app works and what each setting does. I can finally see clearly how much time I have in my day and how I have space for all the activities I want to do. The custom notif sounds allow me to pick a light beeping noise to signify a time block change. Persistant notif gives me an icon at the top of my phone so I never forget what I'm doing. Great app, again, I love it.",1
"This app combined so many features, that normally require multiple apps into a very intuitive interface. What sold me was the widget. I can see my routine, reminders and events in a scrolling timeline, that highlights the current scheduled event. I'm definitely going to upgrade to the pro version. Thanks for a well thought out app. The effort really shows!",1
"Overall, I like the latest update. It's perfect for making schedules. I do wish the blocks had two catagories, past & upcoming so I don't have to scroll past old events to get to my current events. I also wish blocks still had the personal icons instead of only tags. Edit: I really like the atypical routines but I wish the days wouldn't continue to increase when the routine isn't being used.",1
"Great app! Really helps for planning general day schedules that are repeated. However, it would be really helpful if there was also a way to just plan for one day at a time (not repeated)--to be able to plan more specifically day-to-day (and maybe this would auto refresh for each day?). I find it very beneficial to set up specific tasks for the next day, the night before. I would also love a feature where each planned item can be crossed off, to give sense of completion/track progress. Thanks!",1
"Really enjoyed this app, but was disappointed to find it doesn't automatically sync your schedule to your account. I had to reset my phone and was bummed to see the schedule, routines, and tags I worked on for days, tweaking it to fit my kid's days perfectly was gone. Not sure I will take the time to redo it although I really did like it. If you do use it, just make sure you back up your schedule!! Edit: Had to just suck it up and redo my schedule. This app is just too useful.",1
"I absolutely love this app! I tried a few different options before this one and no other timetable/routine app had everything I needed. This app has a free option as well as a small one-time payment option that unlocks all of the features. I paid for the full version and don't regret it for a second. This is sooo helpful for keeping myself on task with my ADHD and the ability to edit routines makes it easy to adjust day to day. The widget option for Android devices is amazing as well! There are so many options for block events and routines, from how they are notified to the color they are on my schedule. I personally like that the notes show up in full on the schedule no matter how long they are so that I can list all the steps of my morning/night routine and don't forget anything. The only thing I wish is that there could be an option to connect this to my computer and have some way to back up my routines/schedule automatically to the cloud. Also, I'd like the ability to make a to do list for each day for things that aren't time-specific, like paying off my credit card and stuff. Like reminders on google calendar, but less annoying, ya know? If there is a way to do this and I'm just missing it, please let me know!",1
"Brilliant. 5/5. My only problem: Would really love to see the ""undo"" option remain after exiting to another menu within the app, as I accidentally overwrote a day on a routine schedule, and pressed the back button in a panic, which disabled the ""undo"" button, meaning I had to redesign the routine! Other than that, this is a stellar app which I would be happy to recommend to anyone wanting to timeblock, and up their output/ productivity in all areas. Remember to make copies of routines as you go.",1
"Edit : Love the app fantastic way to set aside time for what you really should be doing and the notification setter is fairly robust. one thing to mention is that if you don't turn on pop up then you will have to actually click the the notification in notification center. I don't really clear my notifications ever so I had to force stop the app a few times, but after contacting support they help me figure out what I was doing wrong.",1
"Apps like this should really come pre-installed onto your phone. The way its so easy to navigate and how user friendly it is (although I have had a little trouble) is really innovative and interesting. This will definitely help me accomplish alot during my Summer Break, and I look forward to any future updates! (Edit: It would be nice to have the setting for a discreet notification that changes depending on what Block you're on, rather than a bunch of notifications)",1
"As someone who procrastinates constantly and needs a routine to keep myself focused, this app is amazing. The constant notification with personalized icons makes it so easy and helpful to keep track of what's going on and what I need to do next. No, this app isn't perfect. But I've found great use from it. I recommend getting the pro version. It's only 5 dollars and the programmer is SUPER useful :)",1
"It's great! They seem to be actively developing it, so still not the most feature-ful, but very neat, easy, and so far bug free. I'd like to be able to share my schedule with my bf, but no way to do that yet. Takes a minute to decide how you should break your schedule into sub-rourines. I made weekly routines like ""sleep"", ""work"", ""clean"", but they could all go in one routine technically if they all repeat daily/weekly. So far nice UI and easy to see what I have coming up. Thanks dev team!",1
"This app is amazing! It's very user friendly and easy to plan out your day/week. For people who identify as planners, it might be a little addicting,. Being able to make routines for as far in advance as you can imagine, and just turn on that routine when you need it, while having different ones waiting or running is amazing! I just wish that there was a desktop version, or even just a website access point. Hopefully that comes soon!",1
"Very good app. Suggestions would be to add the ability to put my phone in do not disturb during a timeslot (ie; at work), and a sectograph so I can see my full day as a clock",1
I needed a simple app that I can schedule my day throughout. This has a VERY simple interface and a very visually appealing aesthetic. I love it so far! What would really fit the bill even better is if I can drag and drop blocks. Sometimes I have to shift priorities and it messes up my schedule and I need to manually go in and change things in every block thereafter.,1
"Perfect app for my ADHD! Tracking and visualization of time when utilitized right! I'd love to see tap hold/gesture fratures for some actions(deleting/altering some common states of blocks, ect.) Original block vs selected block can be confusing; feels clunky to use or edit. I don't even use templates since it's a bit confusing/non intuitive to me. Check list in blocks would be nice! Displaying overlapping blocks side by side would help!(appointments that override normal daily blocks, so on.)",1
"For being a young project and all the features it has, it's doing a great job. I wanted something that wasn't exactly a calendar or a scheduler or a to-do list, but help me figure out where and how I am spending my time. This is helping with that beautifully. Love the interface, love all the colors. Probably spend way too much time picking out colors and tags! No glitches or problems. Definitely starting a wish list as I use it more! Would love to be able to analyze data in more detail.",1
"This is exactly what I was looking for in an app. It allows you to set up a routine, and choose whether or not it repeats daily or weekly, or a certain assortment of days (such as monday, wednesday, saturday etc.) This app also has notifications for each event to help stay on track with the schedule. It is very easy to use and read, and can be used to plan events, daily tasks, appointments, etc. I absolutely love this app, and to make it better all these features I spoke of are free.",1
"timetune is a very simplistic, organized, and helpful app! i have been looking for an app like this! it's nice on the eyes and you can customize almost everything! it has a dark mode and a cute little widget for your home screen. i recommend it for people that procrastinate and easily forget tasks! ‚ô• (i thought this app had a bug. later on, all my apps started crashing. the developer kindly responded, but had it not been for the response, i might still be trying to fix my phone. thank you!!)",1
"Love the app, it serves its purpose well. I've found that routines are a must for effective and long term habit building. The latest update allows 2 tags per time slot which is awesome. But, the notes now visually appear seperate, or disconnected from the timeslot and tag. It's really just an aesthetic issue, but I do wish it were fixed.",1
"I've only had this app for a week and I love it! My only complaint is one small glitch. When I have routines scheduled in the programmer, some of them show a random tag that's not part of the routine at 12am on each of those dates in the itinerary and widget only, but when I click to edit it, that tag is not actually in the routine. Also, one suggestion for the future: create a feature that allows you to set a whole day back or forward in the number of minutes desired.",1
"I loved this all before, but with the new updates, it is the BEST!! I lose track of time easily and this allows me to make a schedule and choose which items give a notification. This helps me SO MUCH to stay on track throughout the day. Perfect for an ADHD brain! I'm a homeschool mom with a busy schedule and I struggle to keep the household running efficiently. This app is a gift to me!! Additionally ... I haven't encountered a single ad. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Well-designed app. HUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS!!",1
"I've tried a lot of routine apps, and timetune is amazing. I use another app to check off whether I've completed each item or not, because i like the widgets that I get for that feature kn other apps and tracking is good. But the schedule and time manageability timetune gives is GREAT, and I love the alarm features. I would love to see better themes, like custom backgrounds. And I would also love to be able to manage notifications better. The Persistent is too much, but the regular schedule isn't quite as intrusive as I'd like. Need a more customized notifications option. But all in all, 5 golden stars, great app!",1
"This app has been a life-saver so far in college!!! I have several routines worked out: sleep schedule, school week schedule, crunch-time schedule for exams, and another for when my late-start class begins. My class times are a bit confusing, so this ensures I don't forget which day is which! I love all the features it supplies to set reminders or events, and timers that help me keep my pace when I read. Just absolutely love it, use it everyday!",1
"I have severe time management issues, this app has every single crucial feature a chronically tardy person (i.e. Myself) needs. Widget, in-app timer, (custom) notifications, a clean interface, icons and clear color coding ‚Äî everything I've ever needed. Superb app, honestly, it's been a life changer.",1
"Best timer and scheduling app out there by far, in my opinion. This app makes it super easy to visually organize and schedule your entire day and stick to a routine. I'm a very visual person, so being able to schedule my day via colorful time blocks and add tags to each activity helps me stay focused and on track in a way no other app has managed. Been using this app for close to 10 years now (or earlier versions of it) and don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",1
"I really appreciate the efficient and clean design!   I do have one question.  Is it possible to create a time block that has a length but without a specific day/time attached to it? I would love to be able to click on blank time slots and have the time blocks that fit within that time frame on a pull-down menu.  Blocks for things like studying, cleaning, reading, knitting, etc. that don't need to have a set time.",1
A useful app with a few potential improvements. But... the notifications are suddenly gone. I've seen your answers to people reporting the same problem and followed those links but found no help there for my device.,1
Used this in my Samsung and it was great. I then changed phone to an iPhone and cannot get the app üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´,1
"Great for managing adhd! Being able to see the entire notes/comments section of a block is super helpful too, I hope that always remains a feature (or at least an option). I love that you can change the theme, and use color & icon coded tags. Having to manually input everything isn't something I can keep doing, tho. I bought pro, but since my schedule is always changing, the routines option isn't useful for me. I wish I could just have an everyday schedule, and edit individual days as needed.",1
"Not much to say here. It's good. Pros ‚Ä¢ Syncs with your PC via the cloud. A must have nowadays. ‚Ä¢ Interfaces with OneNote via links in the ""Add File"" section. I use both - that's good. ‚Ä¢ Displays schedule on mobile home screen. I find Task display best for mobile and Planner display best for PC. ‚Ä¢ Subtopics are nice if you have a list of things that need too get done under a main topic. ‚Ä¢ Alarm set separately from due date ‚Ä¢ Color change or separate listing for overdue items. [I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as they go by.] Cons ‚Ä¢ No snooze on mobile. Mobile - alarm rings once (softly) and does not repeat for that notification. It would be nice if you could set it to go off every 10 minutes or so until you tell it to shut up. It does leave notifications in the notification bar. ‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt see any way to set alarm sound or duration or volume on mobile.",1
"Great App. Like the options of multiple routines, calender, and reminders. However I wish there was more control over the routines. I'd like to be able to pick the start of my day instead of it starting at 12am. I'd also like to be able to pick what week days for a routine to be active so I can have different routines each day. You can manually program it if you pay for pro version but it's a hassle to go day by day if the routine is going to be used for months.",1
"Would love a tick feature I love this app! Perfect for getting my everyday uni routine pinned down. I really appreciate that it has dark mode and the text is easy to read. I lovee how many reminders of various durations and settings I can have, even ones that alert me after that event! The ui is very easy to understand. Thank you for your hard work. Redownloading now that the overlap issue is gone.",1
"This is my favorite app. For me, having a visual representation of my daily schedule prevents me from missing important things. I have ADD and haven't had success with a regular calendar, but with the sectograph widget on my phone, I can see my schedule superimposed on a clock face every time I check my phone. This helps me a lot. There is a little bit of a learning curve to understand just what you are looking at, but the tutorial is good and once you understand it is very intuitive.",1
"I love this app, great way to view my agenda for today, pro version really worth it. The option to get both from google cal and outlook is awesome as well. And the support of wear os is a blessing. I recommend this app ro anyone who asks. One feature request for the wearOS: would be awesome to be able to include some indicators, like steps or something (the ring for battery is perfect). But even without that feature, this is my fav watch face",1
This app helps me keep track of my life. I am able to display all meetings from work and my other calendars and they're color codes so I know what type of appointment it is. Using the widget and watch app together has made my day so much easier to manage and I haven't missed a meeting since I started using it. Slight learning curve with all the settings but well worth it.,1
"Sectograph provides something immensely valuable: a watch face that makes life with ADHD slightly less harrowing. Oddly enough, it was exactly what I was looking for in practically every respect. Not just a good enough fit; it's like someone read my mind. And if you don't need the paid features, it doesn't bombard you with ads as punishment. It doesn't even crash or bog your device down with unnecessary processing. I literally cannot find any flaws with it.",1
"Firstly, I have to say that this app is one of the most brilliant apps I've ever seen. I love it, I've used it for ages, and it improves my life in a huge way to be able to see my calendar events on a clock. Five stars. Secondly, I'd like to add that if you could make this work with Proton Calandar, it'd help me have less Google. in my life. I could finally migrate, and that would make me thrilled all over again.",1
Love it! So helpful for my neurodiverget brain. I love the watchface and widget and extensive customization options. I'd like to have the watchface be able to open my calendar when pressed. Thanks for making the free version for all to be able to use! I didnt even need to buy the upgrade but did anyway just to say thanks for developing such an amazingly helpful app!,1
A must have for me due to watch integration! I'm using a galaxy watch and with that the app puts the schedule right on to the watch face. Makes it incredibly useful to see my schedule at a glance and get reminders. In general the app is great too. I like the visualization concept and the integration with so many calendar apps. Try it out!,1
"Outstanding, the stock connectivity with various time based applications is perfect and the 5 button layout on the widget is customizable and should be called the 9 button layout! This feature alone is worth the price of admission! Granular controls allow for rich and diverse personalization. My only issue is the app came out in 2013 and I was not on it earlier!!",1
"Very unique, customizable and cool way to keep on track with your daily schedule and access your calender. If one has rated this app low do to user difficulty try to use the resources available. The customization is awesome and one of its strong points! Take a little time to learn, you'll realize it's not so tough. A user mentioned having a syncing issue, prob not the app as it seems to be isolated. Also, a user that complained about battery consumption since edited the review + rated 5 stars.",1
"This app has been immensely helpful in keeping me organized. I prefer to create events in here as I can't set the duration of an event and that is sometimes more intuitive for me. One thing I would love is having events that happen concurrently stack, instead of laying over each other. I like to schedule small tasks during events where I'm expecting to have free time. I would also love to be able to duplicate events and change the calendar an event was assigned to.",1
"This apps is amazing at giving you all the information you want in a very clean and simple way. And includes all your time managements needs, analog, digital clock, day of the week and a calander that all functions smoothly and with easy, and works well with other apps. Also works great on a smart watch, littery sold me on getting one, never could find a watch I really liked before this.",1
"This is a unique & creative way to view & follow the agenda of the upcoming day(s) in a concise manner. If necessary, corrections can be incorpordted without involving a chaotic process. Obviously, a team of talented professionals have been able to incorporate their various specialiities so the spectrograph can be easily adjusted. R√†rely, have I posted a review concerning any app. However. the stellar nature of this excellent work product is well deserving of a comment. Thank you.",1
"It does a pretty good job. I love the widget, and I love being able to look ahead/behind in time. The worst thing about it is the controls. It was pretty tricky to get a hang of, even after playing with the demo version. You kind of have to teach yourself how everything works before you really get anything out of it, but after you do it is worth it. And I'm not saying it's hard to learn! You just have to invest some time. The best thing is that it SO EASILY adds events from your Google calendar.",1
"Glad I stumbled across this app. I don't change my home screen often (maybe once a year), but this one app convinced me to rearrange the whole screen to accommodate its widget, and I'm glad I did! The way the scheduling interfaces with the clock in the widget is something that should have been thought of a long time ago. Edit: I forgot to mention the watch face and app. I have used the same watch face now for 2 years. This app replaced my Pear watch face and I haven't looked back!",1
This app has a small learning curve but wow is the functionality spot on. Absolutely great for visually representing a schedule. I instantly purchased Pro features for the 24-hour widget and utilize it every minute of the day. What compelled me to write this review was the customization options: this app is compatible with any setup. Thanks for helping me keep track of my time from someone who really needs the help.,1
"If you use Google calendar and like circular visualizations of your schedule, this is a must have. I paid the premium charge for the full set of features so I can see a 24 hour calendar view, and I'm going to buy and ""Wear OS"" smartwatch to use this app's smartwatch sync feature to see my widget on both my watch and home screen. Perfect!",1
"So far this app has been really helpful to me. It is a very intuitive way to view time. It helps me realize how much time I *actually* have in my day (which is less than I usually think). It's convenient to have repeating events in it as well. The widget is probably the best part. I get to see my whole day as a nice snapshot and I can always reference what I'm supposed to be doing when. So far, excellent app.",1
I frickng love this app. Good visual for me who is bad at time management. I prefer to see my schedule in the form of a clock. Google calendar schedule view just doesn't do it for me. Am convinced that those that struggle with using this app are the same people who struggle with adding a contact to their phonebooküôÑ. It's straightforward and customizable.,1
"Title: An Exceptional Calendar App: The Perfect Tool to Organize Your Days! Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ As someone with a busy lifestyle, I have always struggled to effectively plan my days and keep track of my schedule. However, my life has taken a significant turn for the better since I discovered an outstanding calendar app that not only helps me stay organized but also offers a visually stunning and intuitive user experience.",1
"Amazing app that makes keeping track of your calendar easier than ever Edit: after using this app for about 2 months, I find myself more inclined to add things to my calendar so they will show up on my widget. It has vastly helped me keep better track of my time throughout the day. I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for an easy [and visually appealing] way to add a little more structure to their day.",1
"I have ADHD. Time management and planning are my worst nightmares. This app makes it so easy to SEE my schedule. The visual representation of the wheel makes it easier to make sense of how much time I have. It's also SO helpful to see how far I am into my day... I could go on. It's a great app and worth the premium price, but the free version is also fantastic.",1
This widget app is so cool. It links right to my Google calendar and shows me in a clock format what my next events are. It's much easier to figure it out in my mind when I see it like this. Rather than go to my calendar and scroll up and down its just a widget on my main screen that shows me details like how many hours til my next event. That's super cool. I think it's a real game changer in daily time keeping.,1
"As someone with time blindness from ADHD, this app is incredibly helpful. The visual map of how far away events are really helps. I love that it syncs up to my Google calendar, so setup was fast. I love how large I can scale the widget up. I immediately payed for the premium version so I could access the 24hr clock face & have no regrets. (Esp when most planner apps are now subscription, a $4, 1-time charge is more than reasonable.) Would be nice to have more visual customization options.",1
"Although there are some features that I wish were easier to use, I think this app is very helpful. If it was possible to add a way to easily reorganize the order of events I would enjoy this app even more. Maybe being able to drag the order of events down at the bottom to change the order on the wheel? For now if I need to make a change to my schedule I have to make individual changes to the times of events. Overall a great application.",1
"Wow this is super helpful. I hope I stick with it. The addition of in app tasks would be nice and if it could pull your alarms from Samsung clock app. I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem to show when my alarms will go off on Samsung clock, just the calendar I'm guessing. More watch face customizations would be nice as well. Like to click to expand an event. This may be included in the paid version, I'm not sure yet, but I will be purchasing the pro version in the near future",1
"As someone with ADHD the concept of time is even more abstract and subjective in my head, so I really helps me to be on time when I have a visual representation of time passing and events looming. It's easy to use and understand. Great app! The only thing that would make it better is to make it a watchface I can put on my Samsung watch. I would die a happy human.",1
"Cool graphics and easy to use. It pulls directly from the calendar you link it to so you only have to input events once. I'm using Google calendar so the calendar displays everyone I've linked with; great way to keep the family in sync. I'd love to have a To Do list added to the functionality especially one that supports the ""bucket"" concept so effect for people with ADHD. I am going to purchase the full app.",1
"This really is pretty handy. It does a good job of visually showing what is happening on a specific day. I tried it a couple of years ago and decided not to use it. I gave it another try and I do like it. Although I probably didn't need it, I purchased the Pro version, because I like the idea that the app is not subscription based (I refuse to fall for recurring payments). Very handy and it works seamlessly with Business Calendar 2 Planner.",1
"This app is the perfect command central. I was just looking for a visual clock, but this is so much more! It is so nice to have an app that automatically syncs with my calendar so I don't have to manually put things in. The interface is super user friendly and the widget is incredibly customizable. I love how clean it looks and how I can customize the buttons to include all my productivity apps in one place.",1
"I really like this app. It helps me visually see how much time I have scheduled for each event. I have it synced with my Google calendar. One recommendation I would make is having different themes for how the widget looks. With my background image, the widget can sometimes be a little difficult to read. But other than that, I would recommend it.",1
"I love the ability to visualize my day ahead with the home screen widget. I just made the transition toward keeping a rigorous, whole-life schedule using Google Calendar, and this app seamlessly integrates with my existing calendar without any effort on my part. Highly recommended for those undertaking the necessary task of organizing their lives.",1
This app finally did what I have wanted. Made a visually appealing way to portray my calendar that is also WearOS compatible. What really helps the visual appeal is the complete control over customization the user is given. Keep up the great work! I would love if clicking the event on the WearOS watch face showed the full event details like the Phone widget does. But perhaps that's not possible with a watch face.,1
"This application should be considered by all who have a vision and a dream to succeed. Those who fail to plan, plan to fail. Sectograph allows you to elaborately plan and prioritize effectively. I absolutely recommend this to all busy professionals who still are positively moved by their achievements. However, i don't think this is for the nonambitious type who are already satisfied completely with where they stand in life. This app can boost your productivity, in a life changing way. Try it!",1
"i love it everyway, it was a good idear to put in the list and the clock at the same time and the colours beautyfull i use it for trading i love that there are no ads if you put them in after this i'm deleting this app. but over all it great planing on buy it too and don't change the price too. just don't change anything........ there is an problam about notifications",1
"Sectrograph is an excellent app, and as a pro user, I'm particularly impressed by the color scheme, graph representation, and event display system. However, I would like to suggest an additional feature: the ability to integrate daily Google tasks into the app. This would be a valuable addition for users who want to track both their time and their tasks in one place. If this feature is already available, I would appreciate it if you could provide instructions on how to use it.",1
"Best app for event schedule planning and visualizations. My favorite schedule app. I have been use it for years. It uses calendar data, and shows events in very conviniant way - with cool sectors! This app has very flexible design options, full control with widget buttons. It has it's own nice calendar. Widget is not lagging, even has special button to refresh widget. These small details shows quality. And support is also very nice and friendly, really want to help, using video instructions",1
I have been using this for a few years now without ever running into an issue. It's a great widget to have on my home screen to show upcoming work meetings and personal events. It's the beat I have found that show time allocation as if viewing them on a clock face. Highly recommend as it does not push hard on buying the upgrade. You can use the widget effectively without.,1
"Exactly like I imagined an app like this should be. The visualization of my day is more intuitive than it looks like at first, it inspires me to follow a structured routine and it has helped reduce my anxiety greatly, since now my day is all planned, easy to follow, and any gaps in my days are easy to know how much time exactly I'll have, which makes it easier for me to plan. I highly recommend this app if u want a routine but can never follow it",1
"Love this app, gives a great overview of my day and looks great on my watch too! Great motivator for creating routines too by mapping them out on a calendar! I do have some wishes for the app to add in the future. One features is to have the ability to hide event series and not just individual events as work calendars are not very customizable. Another one is for wearos to replace the battery indicator in the middle with a complication. But those are just extras.",1
"I've been wanting a visual calendar like this for some time, to the point that I considered making my own after I wrap up my current software project. However, this app has all the functionality you could ever want, and I'm absolutely delighted with it. I paid for the upgrade to pro so that I could customize the colors and it was 100% worth the $8. I'm so glad this exists, and I have no desire to make my own when this does everything I need. I can't recommend this product highly enough!",1
"Thank you so much for adding the ability to tap an event sector on my watch and see the event details. I noticed that I can not turn off the numbers on the face of the watch now. I see the setting on the app, but nothing happens on my watch when I change the setting. The numbers are always there.",1
"Literally the best scheduling format for me. It just makes so much more sense than anything else. I am surprised this format isn't more widely used. You guys have a gold idea in your hands. The design is very aesthetically pleasing, and the level of customizability is something that all other developers should follow. Also the fact that it has a watch face is the cherry on top. As a software engineer, I say very well done.",1
"This is exactly what I need to get work organized! I'm a freelancer who has a complicated calendar which I really just need to visualize! The only thing I wish is that I could make it bigger. It's the center of my page now, but it would be great to have it take up all the space. Also weather in the center would be cool (since it replaced my clock/weather widget) thanks folks!",1
Very clever app. It's clear a lot of thought went into this. Quite customizable and you can still have all the button actions go to your existing calendar app. Bought Pro the same day I downloaded the app... It would be so nice to be able to change the color scheme on the notification widget.,1
"I do like this app. I honestly have not fully used it to it's full potential yet but that's mainly because I have a very settled down, low key, schedule these days, but when I do have an event I can view it on my home screen which I love. I love the organization of my events and it does go great with Google calendar.",1
"Sectograph is probably my favorite phone app. I have a hard time with time management and the way that sectograph displays the time and all the ways I can customize it makes it fantastic. It always works, I never have any issues with it and the developer is very quick to help if needed. Highly recommend!",1
"Sectograph is so helpful for me to visualize my day and how I'm going to spend my time. It's almost like a pie chart of my time, perfect for this visual learner. What I would love is a companion app (watch face or widget) on Samsung Galaxy watches so I can see it on my wrist, too. I use the the widget on my phone's home screen all the time. I love it!",1
"Ok, I definitely need to edit my previous review. This is EXACTLY what I've been looking for in a watchface. Able to integrate my work and personal calendars into a fantastic integration of your watch and agenda. Easy to read, customizable, and honestly just perfect for those on a schedule. Can't believe i couldn't get the app to work on my watch when i first purchased the Pro version. Thanks for the quick response to my earlier review! Top notch developer!",1
"This app is fantastic! I work from home anyway, and with the disruption due to the Coronavirus, it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule. By the end of the day, I hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone. I downloaded Sectograph and it has made all the difference. I am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy. I even recommended it on Twitter yesterday.",1
"I originally doubted how this would help me. But decided to try it & see exactly it was meant to do For me, he most useful thing is it fits my daily schedule into a 4√ó4 size widget. Using a small % of my screen. + the way it's organized, just a quick glance & I see what's happening for the whole day. Way more efficient than digging thru my calendar app. I use a month calendar widget, but don't want to make a 2nd large agenda widget. This solved the problem perfectly!",1
"100% of my day is based on my agenda. Each calendar event is right on my Samsung Galaxy Watch4. Sectorgraph makes my Wear OS device worth so much more, meaning I would buy my watch just for this watch face. I love how my personal and work calendars with colors both are synced and how the past events up to 3 hours are visible. Plus Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries and all day events are also visible on the outer border of my watch face. Note: There are no third party ads in the free version.",1
"I quite enjoy playing with this sectograph. It's easy to set up with as many of you (google) calendars as you want.Once you've familiarize yourself with the settings, it's a quick visual reminder of all your tasks for the day. The adjustable widget size means i can have a giant, readable version on my home screen.",1
"Love the widget, took a minute to figure out all the buttons to sync the watch. Very customizable, which is great! It was my mistake. This is great for my ADD. It allows me to time block so I can get a little distracted and still be on task. So worth the money.",1
"This app is great for what it's for. I can easily manage my Google Calendar in an intuitive way. When I've tried to enter my daily routine using only my calendar, the amount of information was overwhelming. With Sectograph there's a natural flow to how I see the events of the day unfolding.",1
"This is a great app, and it's helped me stay organized in just these last few days. I'm currently working around Google's Reminder issue (it's not accessible per Google's restrictions) by adding a subset to my calendar and setting Events there as reminders. I'd really love for touchable zones on the watch to open applicable apps. And those outer rings could be linked to step goals or other targets!",1
"Such a great app! I have some requests! On the WearOS watch: 1) Have titles to scroll in place so we can read the whole event title 2) Have all day events take up a larger fraction of the watch perimeter, preferably as much as possible, shrinking to fit the available space if more than one all-day event is present 3) Make the start time and event length optional elements on the watch face so we can fit in more title space 4) change the sectors in ambient mode so the text is white with a thin opaque black shadow and the sector itself is the same grey, but uses a diagonal stripe pattern so the total OLED power consumption is substantially lower.",1
"Great idea. A clock dial is certainly how I like to visualize the day. But... the widget's ""Visualization of old events"" should have an ""All"" setting; I use the calendar to record what I have done, so I like to look backwards. 3 hours back is insufficient.",1
I struggle very badly with time management due to ADHD. I absolutely love this app and the way you can put a wiget on your screen. I'd say I'm still struggling but I've only had the app one week & I see improvement in my day planning. Syncs with google calander. I wish I had this app as a stationary screen or watch. Really helps you plan out your day and get an idea of how much time is left & passing. Takes a day or so to get use to it though. Just wish 'reminders' were able to show,1
"I got this app in hopes it would be more task/time management oriented. I wanted an app that helped me divide up and plan to do assignments and tasks by completion time. While this app is not what I was looking for, it's certainly very useful. I love being able to combine all of my calendars in one app that displays my calendar events in a neat, organized graphic",1
"Life-changing, if you use the app right it can very much help you like no other app I've found so far! I have to say a big thank you to the developers, you have no idea how much you've helped me and my family in a time of crisis by just something as simple as this although I do wish there was an option in the app so that the notifications worked like alarms because I have to use a separate app to do that because notifications are so timid. Actually truly life-changing thank you",1
"A brilliant idea, an entirely new way to look at the passage of time that strikes me as having advantages to this square-calendar-concept that is the default. I will admit I have used it in a while, but whenever I do I really enjoy this new way of seeing the time available to me and how it is filled. It gives a clearer perspective about how soon things are. If I had a smart watch and this was a function, I might just look at it all the time.",1
1st: Great concept. Except for the fact that nothing is showing up. It's just a blank clock no matter how much forward I skip. No matter how many times I close the app in hopes of refreshing. None of my events even show up on the widget. Deleting. 2nd: Deleted and redownloaded. It works now.,1
"It's by far the best time tracking app for me, helped me a lot with keeping track of my schedules and getting works done by the time, the only thing I can suggest is showing up the widget when the screen is locked so the user doesn't have to unlock the screen to take a glance at what's the next to-do in his/her daily schedule You've done a great job, thanks for this amazing app, keep it this way, neat and functional, ads will destroy the app, don't resort to the ads",1
"*Note to Samsung users: the app wouldn't update to my google calendar until I selected to ""always use"" google calendar on the pop up window asking what app to use.*üëç I have really struggled following the schedules I create and something about this visual and seeing how much time I have left to complete something or until the next scheduled item has already been beneficial! I put the widget on my home screen to try to help me not get screen-time distracted as well. Thank you developers!!!!!‚ù§",1
"Hands down one of the best apps I've used. The details are very well thought through and the options to tweak are immense. Someone had the patience, smartness and thought to add everything they can think the user will need. As a dev myself, I'd love to get in touch with the brain that built this.",1
"Totally useful and amazing!! Has definitely helped me with time management and stay on everything. I do wish that it would include my alarms, instead of just my calendar, but I make do and it still works out. I have recommended to many people and they've all gotten it too, they're very grateful. 9.75/10 recommend to all, especially students!",1
"I don't have an intuitive sense of time due to my ADD. Because of this, I always wear an analog wrist watch which provides a visual sense of time that can't be accomplished with digital watches. This app manages to do much the same thing in how it displays today's events. The free version is good, but the paid version is well worth the extra cost. Creating separate widgets for work and family makes it much easier to not forget my commitments. Sectograph has become the app I check most often.",1
I kinda just needed something to give me notifications on things I needed to accomplish throughout the day. I needed a nice way to visualise the time I'd be spending and this app is the best thing I've found for that so far.,1
Good....,1
A really great except i don't know how but the tutorial is harder than the actual app. Like it makes itlook really complicated.,1
Next lv..,1
Frickin amazing bro,1
"Spectrograph review. Great app that let me see how I use my time and how to balance things out. I only wish it was $2.99 not $7.99. I'm not sure if Google takes a bigger cut from developers or Apple, but I can see a lot of people buying this app at $2.99.",1
I enjoy having the segmented clock-face display coloured as selected. Great to have the widget on home screen for easy reference too. I recommended it to participants in an online course I'm doing.,1
By far the best calendar view on wearos. However would benefit from being able to have tiles for main calendar view and current event view with time remaining.,1
"almost perfect, I just with in the center of the graph there was a timer so you know how long till the next event or how long left in current event. also needs more color options",1
"Very useful and novel way to visualize your day. The widget is information dense, in a good way!",1
Great . Helped me stay organised through a busy schedule,1
"Love this but new widget please? I've been using this app for organisation for the past few months and it's remarkably good at organising your life but my only request is that you add a widget similar to Google Calendar Day View where I can easily see what I've got to do next throughout the day, the sectograph is too visually confusing for me especially because my day is often jam packed with things to do. Thank you and keep up the good work!!!",1
"I think this app is amazing, but I do wish there were a way to move the text for an event. If I have a work meeting in the middle of work, the text for the two events overlaps.",1
"I REALLY like the idea of this app, so much so, that I paid for the premium version. However, on my Samsung Watch, it did start off showing the different entries from my calendars, but has now stopped and it nothing more than a standard watch face. I've not changed any settings (have you?). Any advice on why this is the case please, coz I REALLY want to give you 6 stars (out of 5!!).",1
I love this app helps me to keep track on my timeblock schedule. I do wish that you could use complications. I purchased a complication that can show your notification Icons and it helps me a ton when doing laundry so I don't forget the washer lol. Sadly I cant use it with this watchface,1
Cool,1
I wish there was a feature where it automatically deletes the previous day to do list. That would be great.,1
usefull even in the free version. you gotta have it!,1
It took me 3 days to figure that my outlook work calendar not syncing was not the app's fault but a company IT policy issue. I don't understand why you don't point users in the right direction in your FAQ? You're probably loosing quite a few potential clients who probably just give up where they could just chat to their IT administrator to sort it out. Also I cant access the detail view pressing on an event on the watch? Wherever I press it just keep switching between 12h and 24h view,1
"I think it's an excellent app, I bought the pro version asap. Cause I knew how good the app would be as a tool to improve my schedule and how I visualize it. BUT I DO HOPE THE DEV DOES add better visual features to sectors and transparency with regard to home screen widget. ‚ù§Ô∏è Edit : bad update, notification seems to have disappeared :( Edit2 : YES UPDATING HAS FIXED THE ISSUE THANKS DEV but I want more colorschemes for the sectograph as features ! Edit3 :updated again ! But add colorschemes to",1
‚úåÔ∏èüëå,1
"It was struggle to get the right resize dat I wanted. but what this app did best was ""a unique scheduling set up I could not pass away. I had to invest."" I look forward to more apps and more innovative ways than to do the str8 path. We all need the str8 path but the way life comes at us sum of what we want never really comes win we desire them to. So if we don't persist around uniquely. Such time will be lost.",1
"Would love a setting to enable notifications for the end of an event, for example i want to know when my break ends :)",1
"Seems to only support Google and Microsoft for calendars, and only Android's stock alarm clock, I use Skiff for calendar and the Early bird alarm clock (that's what the app's called), please add support for them, thanks.",1
Nice,1
"I'mAlways procrastinating, thinking I have more time than I do, ya know, thinking that you can do it in 15 minutes when it actually takes 2 hours, anyways, this app has been very helpful in helping me to visualize my time and manage my day, also it helps me to be accountable, like I'll give myself 45 min to clean my room, 5 min to dick around for a sec, then half an hour to do the dishes etc etc, wouldLoveToWritemore, but cant:( 10/10 wouldRecommend, increase my quality of life 10 fold!",1
Solid app so far,1
This Is what I needed. Thank you!!,1
I absolutely love this visualisation for my watch and phone home screen - I'm ADHD and struggle with keeping track of time but this is super helpful to make sense of how long things are. The only thing I dislike is that it's almost TOO customisable. I would love to be able to just select from a small list of pre-set themes. Trying to change every single colour for every single item so that it looks nice and coherent is a bit of a pain. I still love it and I regularly recommend it to people!,1
Looks smart,1
"Need help. Bought the Pro version but my phone got hacked recently. Reset my phone to factory defaults, sent an email to get pro version back (bought in 2/2023), got no response. I don't want to purchase app twice. Please fix. Your app is very useful",1
"On my Watch 4 the outer layer isnt visible, as if zoomed in towards the middle layer. Then randomly it'll reappear and vice versa versa.",1
Wish a companion app was available for Huawei watches,1
"This app is awesome, I love the wear os compatibility. I have a couple feature requests. It would be great if you could filter which calendars you can see on the greyscale mode. Also it would be nice to have an option in the settings for making the watch 24 hours always, currently if I restart my watch it switches back to 12 hours, so I have to turn on the tap to toggle feature, tap my watch, then turn off the tap to toggle feature since I don't want to accidentally switch it back.",1
"This is one of my favorite apps. With so many thoughtful features, there's a bit of a learning curve so it's important to experiment. Def. capable of replacing your calendar but its true value is the home screen widget. It offers a pro version, which is well worth it, but the free version is every bit of 5 stars itself. One request. can you add a sunrise/sunset event based on location? This feature would integrate perfectly. While you're at it, let's see the moon's phases too!! üôèüèªüåûüåñüåôüåùüëè",1
"It looks very slick, and is, so far, my favorite watch face. It really does help me visualize time until my next meeting and how much time I'm able to work outside of meetings. One possible improvement would be the ability to color all of the events coming from a certain calendar together in addition to being able to color them individually. Edit to add: there is already an option for this... awesome! So...maybe the ability to add some tap-able areas on the watch face?",1
"I first found Sectograph shortly after becoming an Android user for the first time and loved it! Then I started getting into theming, especially very minimalistic theming, and the widget didn't fit well on many of my home screen layouts (my preference, not any issue with the app). But now with the notification bar option, it's back in regular use!! I'm entertaining the idea of getting a smart watch, so it's exciting to see that would be an option as well! Thanks for an awesome app!",1
"I really like this app and it is definitely a very nice visual way to keep track of time. The one MAJOR issue I keep encountering though is that it does not seem to easily sync with my Google calendar, which is where I have all my daily tasks stored. Edit: after trying a few troubleshooting options (including the FAQ suggestions), I was finally able to get Sectograph to begin syncing again by uninstalling and reinstalling Google calendar. It seems like it was a one-time glitch. Love this app!",1
"Out of box, I really am liking it! Usually I don't review things, but it's pretty awesome. Definitely interested to see if it has integrations. Time boxing built in - easier day view migration of tasks that sync to google calendar. I think it would be awesome to create a time box for list of similar grouped tasks that's communicated to google calendar, able to move them to and from groups. Overall, the app has a lot of customizations. It feels more like a Tasker or Nova for your to-do list.",1
"It is a lovely interface for your calendar. I think it would be fantastic with a smart watch. I use it as a widget on my phone, and I like the way it maps out my day. I wish I could code the color of the events to specific calendars to reflect how my google calendars are set up, and I would love if it worked with other calendar apps or todo list apps, since google 'reminders' aren't compatible with anything - not even with other google apps.",1
"I have ADHD and medication can only do so much; planning and organizing are on me to improve. I've tried a variety of apps. The best part for me is that it visually changes throughout the day with upcoming plans, and with plenty of time in advance to still feel in control. All other apps I've used are repetitive, or I don't open them and forget, the same buzz/tone for reminders gets ignored after a few weeks, this one gently reminds right on my home screen and stays visually interesting Perfect",1
"Fantastic time interface. I have ADHD, and being able to remedy time blindness with clear information about how much time there is between events and when I need to be ready for things is just perfect. No idea how good the event creation interface is, I've just tied it to my personal and work calendar apps and left it at that. One request, I'd love to be able to further customize the interior of the center ring, I don't like the preset options and would like to just enter a date format string.",1
"Love this app! I always want to visualize my schedule, but seeing everything in list or crammed schedule somehow stress me out a lot. But seems like this clock-like visualization works well for me! I use todoist and google calendar to sync up with this, and add some emoji to the event title, make the viz even more clear! Also, the update is one-time payment, which is amazing, also I don't even feel limited in free mode. Hurray to the dev!",1
"This is one of those potential game-changer apps; thoughtfully designed, programmed well, and dare I say revolutionary. I found myself ignoring the normal calendar ""Schedule"" widget for lack of accessibility. The presentation of the Sectograph app and widget are both intuitive and attractive. It's a sure sign that a product is good when you start to rethink planning and scheduling from the ground up. I also applaud the developer for taking a more nuanced approach by offering a robust and functional app (without tacky ads) with optional and significant add-on purchases. After using it for a week I'm ready to fully support the creators with a purchase--probably the highly customizable pallete chooser but I'm also curious about the 24 hour display function. This is development done right. This is one of those apps that is so good you want to see what else has been made by the same people. Cheers.",1
"I hope dev keeps going with it. This is the most original and useful productivity app out there. Time is cyclical, sunrise then sunset ad. Infinitum. Never made sense to me to think about time during the day as a chronological line moving downward, like on a traditional planner. Sectograph only gets better the more you use it. It's really special. Install and play around. The initial learning curve is how you know it's so good, you'll see.",1
Happened to come actress this App while looking for a widget that would give me the hours remaining for alarm time. This does that and a whole lot more. A really great visualization of calendar reminders with a quick view of how long to the next event. It took awhile to configure to my liking but now working great. I'm not sure how to save the widget confirguarsion beyond the current saved version but maybe I'm missing that. . App seems very stable and highly functional. Very impressed.,1
EDIT: I can see the events now. This app is very functional for me so far. . . . previous review: I just installed the app today and thought it was super cool. The issue that I have is that not all of my events from my gmail calendar are showing up on sectograph. I even tried adding an event through sectograph and it wouldn't show up. I doublechecked which calendars were marked to show up and it doesn't make sense why only some events are showing up from the gmail calendar and not all of them.,1
"This is the literal best app I have ever used in my entire life. Awesome features: -Syncs with Smartwatch seamlessly -Syncs with Google Calendar -Look amazing, makes sense. -Has widget option for homescreen Needs Work: -Changing clock appearance is a little clunky. User Interface could be improved. -Changing clock appearance doesn't look ver aesthetic, but it is operational. -App has a little bit of a learning curve to it, but once you learn, it's not difficult and looks amazing.",1
"I'm testing this app for a disabled person. I am loving it within 15 minutes of using it! One thing I think would really benefit him and myself would be to have a button or link within the task details page to open the alternate calander that is selected, such as Google Calendar. The Sectograph Calendar does not allow attachments. This way, an attachment such as a picture can be added to the task. Great app!!",1
"Great app. I have a couple of feature requests. 1. Let me create a template, where I can have an event set up with a particular duration (45 mins) and reminder alarms turned off, so that I don't have to keep customizing those details many times per day for many events. 2. You already have a setting for the default duration of an event, but there are only a few options. There should be a numeric dial where I can set any value from 1 to 1000.",1
"SO nice to see my day on a clock face! This makes it way easier to keep it straight in my head and I love the versatility with being able to add just a line for a start of an event, block out the time, hide events, or have the flags if it's several hours long (my husband's work schedule doesn't take up the entire space anymore üòÑ) I know there's more features because my husband keeps showing me the next cool thing he just figured out it can do- tons of thought and effort into this!! Thank you!!",1
"Great app and it is free. Well structured. All the necessary information at one glance. Gives a good idea visually how much time certain tasks occupy of a day. Great if you want to simplify managing your time. No bugs, no glitches, no annoying ads. I feel almost bad for using this app for free. I am going to get the premium version for the visuals and to support this. Thanks for this amazing app. I love it. It's excellent. Very happy with this. Yes.",1
I really like the visual aspect of this scheduler. I have ADHD and I'm on the spectrum and establishing a routine is really hard for me but to visually be able to see what's coming up and not too far ahead to start worrying about things unnecessarily really helps me to focus in on right now. And it's the visual nudge I need to Make the move from one activity to another which is difficult for me. This app is neurodivergent-friendly.,1
"Sectograph, an innovative app, transforms my daily tasks into an intuitive visual pie chart, enhancing time management. Its seamless integration with calendars and color-coded segments aid in efficient scheduling. This app not only boosts productivity but also adds an aesthetic appeal to planning. Highly recommended for optimizing daily routines, Sectograph is a must-have for efficient and effective time management.",1
OK this app is seriously game changing for the neurodivergent mind!!! I have add and I've always really struggled with time management because it just doesn't compute for my brain and I often overestimate what I'm able to accomplish in a day. With this app I'm able to visually SEE how my day fits together and where there are gaps between scheduled events/tasks that I can fit something in. I honestly can't recommend this enough if you have add too! I just wish I had more colors to choose from.,1
Great so far. Upgraded to pro so I can tap the watch face to bring up description of event. Keeps a visual reminder of my upcoming meeting and appointments right there. Areas for improvement: 1. A very few items have not uploaded to the app or watch for some reason. 2. The app when new always seems to default to not updating the watch. 3. Let me dial the watch forward like the app so I can see events on future days,1
"As someone with ADHD, I love this app! It takes some getting used to, but it's wonderful once you do! It took me so long to find an app/widget that provides a nice, clean visual. I love that you can use a 24-hour mode, which is what really sold me on this app. I have weak planning/time management skills, so having that full visual really helps me, ESPECIALLY being able to see how much time there is until the next event!",1
üëç,1
How to add widget on my home screen I'm using mi phone,1
"Im a visual person, so this helps me so much throughout my day. A feature request I have is to please allow the ability to use complications. This enables me to use my notifications directly on the face of my watch and it would be great to have the middle area show me when my washer/dryer is done lol",1
Great idea. Really it's 4 1/2 stars. If this app would partner with an app like Business Calendar and become a fluid interaction / view to use with the regular calendar it would be phenomenal. The circular view and general functionality of the app are wonderful. Excellent work!!!,1
Good you will come to get where you are weasting time where you can improve.,1
Sukak aja pokonya tp ga aku kasi btng 5 krn takut jadi ga grts lagi fiturnya hehehe,1
As a forget and visual person... (I'm not paid to review) I absolutely love this app. I struggle with visualizing the amount of time I have between tasks and events. Usually always late. It's so convenient to have it as a widget on my main screen to keep me in check throughout the day! This is such a beautiful app. I've used it for about a month and it's also helped with keep with a routine which is so important to my mental health. Highly recommend to those who has difficulties monitoring time.,1
_Great qpp. Does what it claims almost perfectly. _Its a bit expensive for what it provides but atleast it is not a sucscription based app which would not be on my phone if it was Few features that could improve my workflow significantly: 1-A light windows PC version that allows me to manage everything from my computer. I'd fully move to Sectograph for scheduling my meetings across my accounts. 2- ability to let the watch face assign event sections colors per the calendar the belong to,1
"This is the best app. Very intuitive and customizable, lots of support for different things like wear os. I've had it over 10 years & 4 phones - edit** I just got a galaxy watch so I can fulfill the dream I had when I first searched for this circular schedule app in 2013ish. Seriously amazing, thank you üòä üôè",1
"Wow. That was a quick fix! The button toggle did the trick. (For context: The 24-h display just vanished. All the setting say it should be there, but the widget displays the 12-h dial instead.)",1
Why it can't automatically refreshed? I should push sync button (include widget in the notification). My phone is ROG Phone 2,1
"Has been very helpful for keeping my routine, and the widget has been a great help, along with the notifications. Best looking and working routine calendar app I've used.",1
Awesome App!!!!!!!!!,1
It is easy to use and definitely schedule my time,1
I found this very useful for a heads-up on my home screen of stuff coming up graphically where I wouldn't ordinarily open my calendar to see it. I like it. Good work.,1
Best app i ever use,1
Excellent app,1
24 hours clock OP,1
"Super smart and convenient, just add the widget to your android desktop and you can glance at your scheduel without having to open your app",1
"Love this app, it's very helpful.",1
GOOD MORNING AMERICA üá∫üá∏,1
Excellant,1
The Best!!!!!,1
The one which I searched for it a lot. Solve all the needs I want. Thanks,1
"It's a good app, I only use the notification bar widget and I really like how it changes shape based on the notification size.",1
Useful,1
Hi Team. Please add weather with animations and alaram with animations features in this.,1
The app helps me very well so I don't forget things. It's nice to see what's coming on the watch.,1
For the visual people.,1
Helpful,1
"An essential time orientation tool on the phone, the watchface increases its utility by an order of magnitude.",1

"I can now edit individual days even when something repeats, perfect :3",1
Best app,1
"Best app for event schedule planning and visualizations. My favorite schedule app. I have been use it for years. It uses calendar data, and shows events in very conviniant way - with cool sectors! This app has very flexible design options, full control with widget buttons. It has it's own nice calendar. Widget is not lagging, even has special button to refresh widget. These small details shows quality. And support is also very nice and friendly, really want to help, using video instructions",1
"Wow. That was a quick fix! The button toggle did the trick. (For context: The 24-h display just vanished. All the setting say it should be there, but the widget displays the 12-h dial instead.)",1
"The latest update disabled syncing between phone and watch :( No events shown on the watch :(. Edit: Thanks, it works now.",1
"Literal lifesaver. I'm severely timeblind, so I have the widget on my homepage, linked to my calendar so I can always see. Don't know what I would do without it. Thank you for this. Worth the set up, and worth purchasing Pro ‚ú®",1
"Very useful, especially on your watch.",1
Very nice app,1
"Even the free version is just great, it provides just enough. I love it. The only watch face that's complicated enough to look good, but in a way that it's not just design, but actually improves productivity.",1
This has been an amazing app to help me visualize and understand my full day at a glance. I can't recommend it enough for folks who want to be on to of everything they do.,1
I love ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç üíñ this app very much. It is very easy to use.. hats üëí üé© off to makers..... It is very good app because as a student I can make my sectograph of a day üòä üòÄ Thank u ‚ù§Ô∏è üòä,1
"Well I like having an agenda where, if needed, I can be reminded of what I need to do. However, I am not liking how after 3-5 days of reminders, it just stops doing it and I have to go in in order to refresh. At this point a normal calendar app preinstalled would be better, since I can set it to remind me every day. Could this be fixed?",1
"Great for time management as long as you have a repeating routine. Blocks and programmer tab not intuitive/useful. Would LOVE to be able to share my routine with another user (read only) so we can adjust our routines to better coordinate free time, work outs, meals, etc. Would also LOVE to see (maybe instead of blocks tab) an ""Appointments"" tab where you could input a single occurance event that would then show up on your schedule. User can choose which is done, effecting weekly hour count.",1
"I just started using this. One thing I would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event. For example I have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm. I would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that I need to do dishes, vaccume, and dust in that time frame, and be able to mark off each task as it is complete.",1
This app is amazing! You can tell the developer really thought through alot of the functionality of what's in the app. I lobe the layout of the time slots for your tasks and I highly recommend using this app. My only reservation on 5 starts is a small detail in the widget but even the widget is near perfect. It shows you a whole week which you can easily scroll through!,1
I like and use this app the most out of the other apps I've tried but this app doesn't have two key features that would help anyone be more productive. 1. There is no way to drag timeblocks to move them to different times in the day for easy schedule changes. 2. A feature that lets me tap any time in the day and place in previously made time blocks. (i.e. have a place to store more permanent timeblocks) Both are Big deal breakers (I almost Didn't use the app) PS. Please add custom themes .,1
"I'm not sure if this does what I want. The premium version may, but not enough description. I want to make a daily goal to do something for 1 hour every day (5 minutes here, 20 minutes there, Keeping time with a stopwatch rather than hard scheduled) and see how well I do over time. I like the look, but I'm going to scout around for something to try before I buy. I appreciate that you don't collect/share data, so that's the reason for the extra star.",1
"I love this app so so much, but the biggest drawback is that I have no desktop software or web app to go with it. I get easily distracted by my phone while working, and have to set it aside when I'm trying to be productive. I like the routines and visual time blocking, and I want to be able to access them from my desktop computer as well. If such a thing exists and I'm unaware, I'd be happy to install and change my rating! I read requested fts page, willing for cheap sub cost to access web app",1
"This app has a ton of potential, but it needs some basic features. 1. It would be nice to have the option to see the block view with all the times in one hour chunks even if something isn't scheduled there so you can see what free time you have in a day at a glance. 2. You can choose a color for your time block, but it doesn't fill the whole card. It would be nice if you could turn on color blocking so the entire block turns the color you choose. 3. Desktop version is a must. These are the three major features that need to be added. Otherwise it seems to be a great app and worth paying for.",1
"It is useful for setting time to work on something. I wish at the same time it also had an option not to use a block. Also, a timer to finishing an assignment would be useful. Additionally, being able to repeat templates, but not at the exact same times of the day would be useful. Also, putting a tasks in between a block such as a break. As for paying, I would consider it for a one time payment or definite number of payments",1
So far really enjoying how I can create blocks and the ease of adding the tag its makes for quick planning. I would like to see an option to easily adjust the blocks. For example say I block in work and I have to stay a half an hour late...now I have to manually adjust the start and stop times of the activities that followed. It would be nice to press + hold over a block and move it up if needed!,1
"Seems like a very well made app. Very good for if you want a rigid schedule that has plenty of options for repeating patterns. One thing I would maybe look into adding would be a feature where you could set an assumed cost of an activity such as your daily lunch or dinner, or maybe your commute so that you could plan your budget along with the schedule.",1
"extremely helpful app! allows me to organize and alot my time in a way that perfectly fits the way i think about time, with many tools and customization options to help! my only complaint really is that there is no middle ground between paying a subscription or just using the free version... its a very useful app and i would like to support the developers without having to commit money forever. please consider adding a form of one time payment for no ads or a few extra features or something!",1
"This is the best time blocking app I've found, but it still has some significant pain points. I wish there was a desktop version, since creating/updating blocks would be 5x faster with a keyboard, mouse, and large screen. Editing would be faster too if blocks could temporarily overlap, and if routines were per day instead of per week.",1
"I really like this app! I ended up getting a paid subscription because I like the data it lets you access. Being able to see how I spend my time has been so helpful. However!! I'd really like to track my sleep. The problem is that if a block covers two days, for example, sleeping from 10pm to 8am, it'll count all those hours on the first day. Please fix this!",1
Great so far. Upgraded to pro so I can tap the watch face to bring up description of event. Keeps a visual reminder of my upcoming meeting and appointments right there. Areas for improvement: 1. A very few items have not uploaded to the app or watch for some reason. 2. The app when new always seems to default to not updating the watch. 3. Let me dial the watch forward like the app so I can see events on future days,1
"so far so good! relatively easy to use. I was really hoping to be able to check off routine items when completed. trying to build up on habits. so it would be great to be able to track completed progress. calendar sync in pro verson went seamless! however when i go to change a routine item because it conflicts with a calendar appointment,there is not option to just edit that one Tuesday. its either all Tuesdays or no Tuesdays. It would be great to see date options & completed progress tracking",1
"Exactly what I needed! Working from home is tough, and having stretches of unstructured time can be daunting. I like set different productivity times and meal times to look forward to. And reminders to do my skincare ofc. The widget needs some changes... I'd like it if the tags were able to sit side by side instead of stacking vertically, so the block looks like one item and less like a confusing list of words and tags. Maybe display symbols of tags only and adding divisions?",1
"Downloaded this app back in high school and got the premium version, I love it! It's very well put together and exactly what I need for focusing on important tasks for the day -- not just for work but at home as well! Four stars because more recently (since moving to Android 11), I've been having a bug where notifications just stop. May be as much an issue with Android 11 as TimeTune, but I really need this issue fixed before giving 5 stars. Notifications are central to this app's function.",1
"I love how many options you have for setting notifications. My Fasting routine notifies me at the start, 30 mins before it ends, and when it ends. Very cool. The app is missing two pretty big features though. 1. The ability to see how your routines overlap. Right now it's completely unintuitive. You basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2. An indication for what the current time is. Again, math in your head. A schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time",1
"I'm liking it so far. It's a very customizable experience, and I can really get into the details without the interface being too complex. I would like to see more widget options for the ap on the home screen. I like to see my schedule and routine the moment I open my phone. While there is a widget, it's rather lack luster. Synced with the programming, I think it would be cool if they had a calendar widget available.",1
"This app is helping me get my (totally ADHD) life in order! The only thing I wish this had was a slightly more elegant visual layout as far as hour by hour goes. If it were able to be adjusted so that the blocks were larger to represent longer amounts of time I would give it 5 out of 5! Also if it was easier to adjust individual blocks without having to remember to go back to the original block first. Okay, that's all!!",1
"This app is great, and they're super quick to respond if you have an issue/question. This is the only app of it's kind I could find that you can plan intervals w/ start/finish alerts (w/ more options too). The only drawback I have that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the lack of desktop access. I also wish there was a way for blocks to overlap in more of a visual way, and that the length of time for the blocks was more visually represented as well. But overall, this app is super helpful!",1
"Great for maintaining and keeping a routine. This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right. It is a bit tedious for some people, (that's why the 4 stars) but they can keep it simple and high-level if they like. But, if you really want to tame that beast called your work week, school agenda, or personal days like me, this will take care of it.",1
"I love this app. The customizability in the reminders and tasks is perfect for helping me with my ADHD, and having the reminder overlays make it difficult to ignore - so helpful! The ONLY thing I wish was available is a way to track completed items so that I can hold myself accountable. No need for fancy statistics or analyses, just a simple streak or chain count would do. A lot of other apps have this, but they just aren't nearly as customizable, or easy to use. Thanks for all your help!",1
"This app is great. The reminders work and the customization is great. As someone with ADHD, this is super helpful in my daily routine. The only thing that would make this app better is if each entry was treated as a task, with a ""Mark as Complete"" button in the notification, allowing you to mark it as done. For people that rely on the satisfaction of marking something as done, this would be extremely helpful and satisfying. Dopamine on tap.",1
"It's exactly suited to my time management needs. I only have 2 real gripes: 1.) I need to have my notification sound on in order to get notifications sound. That means, not just timetune, but every text, push notification, etc, would have my phone yelling at me, which is annoying. I tried Alarm volume channel, but that didn't create any sound either. 2.) It'd be great to have a widget that displayed JUST the current time block, not the continuous schedule into the distant future.",1
"With a small learning curve, it is a beautiful, intuitive way of scheduling the day.",1
It is on my must have top five list!,1
"This app clock is great! I really like it. I've been using it for years now‚Äîstill using it!‚Äîand it just keeps on getting better. A suggestion tho, it would also be great if there's a desktop version of it and free syncing between computer and phone. Anyway, thanks for this!",1
Good,1
"New to the app, but it looks very useful based on what I've seen thus far. I'm looking for an option we're saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule, but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added (e.g., impromptu select ""laundry"" and it's automatically integrated/layered onto present schedule w/ a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine). If it had/has that, then it's five stars for me.",1
I have been using this for a few years now without ever running into an issue. It's a great widget to have on my home screen to show upcoming work meetings and personal events. It's the beat I have found that show time allocation as if viewing them on a clock face. Highly recommend as it does not push hard on buying the upgrade. You can use the widget effectively without.,1
Literally the best planning graph out there! Like I get to see everything planned out with their particular time frame attched to it. App like no otherüòäüëçüëç,1
"Love this app, gives a great overview of my day and looks great on my watch too! Great motivator for creating routines too by mapping them out on a calendar! I do have some wishes for the app to add in the future. One features is to have the ability to hide event series and not just individual events as work calendars are not very customizable. Another one is for wearos to replace the battery indicator in the middle with a complication. But those are just extras.",1
"""Event not found"" with all day events when using the Google Calendar app. Everything works fine when using Sectograph as the editor. Even reinstalling the app doesn't help. I really hope this can be fixed but I'm increasing my rating because I'm not 100% sure this is Sectograph's fault. If you are having issues with Google Calendar, Business Calendar 2 is a good alternative. Thank you for still developing this awesome app and please hurry up with the web version! LOL",1
I love how it lets me know exactly what I need to be doing at a glance,1
Intuitive and informative diagram.,1
An indispensable tool for neurodivergent ppl like me in day-to-day time management,1
"OMG. Where have been in my life!!! Here are some suggestions :) 1. Can we have web/windows version that can sync with the android/IOS? 2. Can we have a button where we can set a day to ""Holiday"" which will automatically remove schedule that is preset to that paritcular date? Or have a ""select"" option to remove event in bulk. TQTQTQ!",1
Best in the game!,1
Good one you must try,1
It's a great app with amazing features and also easy to handle.,1
I am loving this ! Would love more color options for events,1
One of my favourite apps.,1
"It's a good app, we can set a schedule for our day from morning till we take a rest",1
"wow, just wow",1
Thank you,1
Great,1
Very nice layout...,1
Goodüëç,1
Great app. Clear view of calendar and integrates well!,1
My time on home screen not working it's only working when i get in the app but in widgets it not works it shows time when i entered the app I request to solve it My model is lenovo Tablet M8,1
Works fine.,1
"The app is good .i think you should include the to do list ,task list for users.its easy when you know what you gonna do today so accordingly to it we will invest our time .i think because of 'to do list ' task ' people might skip this app even though it's really good and effective",1
"For the first time I was found Sectograph many years ago. For now, I still in love with it. Thank you for your creation <3",1
"I can say it's good as for my requirements, but i like to ask to add a feature also, that is, can the winget on mobile have""press on event to show details"" option. Like it has on app and watch face.",1
"It's almost perfect. I have bought the premium version. I'd like one feature to be added on the smartwatch face (which I use often). I would like the events names from Google Calendar to be written at least on 2 lines (or even 3), not just one on the watch face, so I can get more context.",1
"Love it! So much that I bought the pro license twice. One for my private phone and one for the work phone! That said, I am missing support for Proton. I am sure that many Proton users would love a sectograph calendar integration üòä",1
the best for time management.,1
I have adhd. My kids do too. This is the best free app for scheduling out your day . You get reminders exactly when you need them. It does for free better than other apps you have to pay for. Amazing. It's a life saver for me,1

"Literal lifesaver. I'm severely timeblind, so I have the widget on my homepage, linked to my calendar so I can always see. Don't know what I would do without it. Thank you for this. Worth the set up, and worth purchasing Pro ‚ú®",1
"Few bugs, but overall great app. Even though I paid for the upgrade to be able to have 24-hour display, my homescreen widget and watch apps seem to refuse to show the 24-hour clock/display. Hopefully gets fixed soon.",1
Install this amazing app and and ecperience some incridlbe performence.,1
"Great app! I use TimeTune to time block my entire day into short segments. A few fixes: [ when scheduling a day in advance, the time auto-sets to 24 hours (ending next day). If I scheduled breakfast from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, it automatically sets to 830 AM the next day. Very tedious to change.] [difficult to see overlapping tasks] [no easy way to push an entire schedule back, if you are late on one item, and need to push everything by 10 min for example. You have to change each manually.]",1
_Great qpp. Does what it claims almost perfectly. _Its a bit expensive for what it provides but atleast it is not a sucscription based app which would not be on my phone if it was Few features that could improve my workflow significantly: 1-A light windows PC version that allows me to manage everything from my computer. I'd fully move to Sectograph for scheduling my meetings across my accounts. 2- ability to let the watch face assign event sections colors per the calendar the belong to,1
Best,1
Very good üëçüòä forever,1
It's a really useful app for arranging tasks üíõ,1
This app is fabulous,1
"I needed to set up a schedule to keep track of time nd start making everyday routine andso far ever since I downloaded this app it been helping me keep my chores done eat 3meals a day .nd start working ,working out , shower, sleep wakeup nd again repeat this routine gracias !",1
"As someone with ADHD, I love this app! It takes some getting used to, but it's wonderful once you do! It took me so long to find an app/widget that provides a nice, clean visual. I love that you can use a 24-hour mode, which is what really sold me on this app. I have weak planning/time management skills, so having that full visual really helps me, ESPECIALLY being able to see how much time there is until the next event!",1
"Great app, with a unique style. I can see my tasks mapped out on a clock which is very helpful for keeping to time. Even the free version enables one to use the app properly. Thank you üëç",1
"Exactly like I imagined an app like this should be. The visualization of my day is more intuitive than it looks like at first, it inspires me to follow a structured routine and it has helped reduce my anxiety greatly, since now my day is all planned, easy to follow, and any gaps in my days are easy to know how much time exactly I'll have, which makes it easier for me to plan. I highly recommend this app if u want a routine but can never follow it",1
Overall I have enjoyed this app. I did encounter an issue very recently but this got solved very speedily and very efficiently by their support. Do not regret having gone pro.,1
"Hands down one of the best apps I've used. The details are very well thought through and the options to tweak are immense. Someone had the patience, smartness and thought to add everything they can think the user will need. As a dev myself, I'd love to get in touch with the brain that built this.",1
üëç,1
I love it,1
"Few bugs, but overall great app. Even though I paid for the upgrade to be able to have 24-hour display, my homescreen widget and watch apps seem to refuse to show the 24-hour clock/display. Hopefully gets fixed soon.",1
Great way for me to keep the entire day in focus instead of just the next task,1
Helped me organise my day better with its visual representation,1
"i love it everyway, it was a good idear to put in the list and the clock at the same time and the colours beautyfull i use it for trading i love that there are no ads if you put them in after this i'm deleting this app. but over all it great planing on buy it too and don't change the price too. just don't change anything........ there is an problam about notifications",1
"This is the best app. Very intuitive and customizable, lots of support for different things like wear os. I've had it over 10 years & 4 phones - edit** I just got a galaxy watch so I can fulfill the dream I had when I first searched for this circular schedule app in 2013ish. Seriously amazing, thank you üòä üôè",1
The best app to get organized,1
It's a different way seeing your calendar appointments.,1
"Sectrograph is an excellent app, and as a pro user, I'm particularly impressed by the color scheme, graph representation, and event display system. However, I would like to suggest an additional feature: the ability to integrate daily Google tasks into the app. This would be a valuable addition for users who want to track both their time and their tasks in one place. If this feature is already available, I would appreciate it if you could provide instructions on how to use it.",1
Best most functional face by far.,1
This app is so much usefull to manage time than the other apps and I think it'll be more effective if there're sound effects for reminder and if there's a reminder after finishing a session,1
Love this app. Very good display for time management. Would like to have photos as background of the watch.,1
"I can't describe how much this is helpful! I've been looking for something like this for so long, I am so glad I discovered it. absolutely 5 stars!",1
"Epic app , excellent so far and perfect for timeblocking.",1
Excellent way to visualise schedules. Widget on the phone is very convenient. Nicely fits on Smart watch face too. Thank you developers.üåπ,1
I love this design and style,1
Best,1
Amazing,1
Superb,1
I have adhd. My kids do too. This is the best free app for scheduling out your day . You get reminders exactly when you need them. It does for free better than other apps you have to pay for. Amazing. It's a life saver for me,1
"I like it alot, and im thinking to buy the full version, but if only there would be a search bar in the Calender, so if i would create on Calender an even for the future and you forgot the date, i would love to look it up, i would know on which dates these events are. For Calender this wouls be really handy So i can look up when someone has birthday by only searching his name",1
It's a good experience,1
"The app is getting better all the time. It would be ideal if the Add To-Do pop-up was just a tad larger (taller) so that all option buttons could be displayed, rather than having to swipe left or right to access them. Swiping causes you to sometimes close the pop-up, losing the data that you just entered - particularly with larger fingers. üòÅ",1
"The app is working very nicely. Like the way it picks up flagged emails from outlook. One functionality I would like to see is an in progress status. Helping me organize my work. Would also be nice to have category priorities. A,B,C etc. Also it would be nice to be able to assign tasks to a specific day. Setting priorities for tomorrow arranging my list.",1
Just started using.... Too new to really know but so far I like it,1
Helpful,1
"I love this app, pretty simple and to the point. Although choosing rewards for myself is hard. Make sure when you purchase premium you make sure you select the right plan, I ended up getting charged $17 but they have started a refund.",1
This app is great! My only complaint is how complicated it is to initiate each task.. how do I know if it increase 50% discipline or 100%?,1
"Does what it says on the tin, and doesn't shove premium in your face. (Premium is worth it, in my opinion.) All I wish it had was a way to group skills separately from characteristics; after a certain number of them, they become quite difficult to view in the graph, and searching through the list would be greatly eased by foldable groups.",1
Really an awesome app for doing tasks. Helps keep track of tasks and also keep procrastination at bay. One small issue is that I don't get any reminder even I set one. Still a great app. Hope they fix the issue,1
"The app is great and I sure would love to have more perks such as having to pick a photo from the rewards section so I could gain more motivation such as a doll of a certain series I love, kinda like buying something that is thrilling.",1
"Like the app but why doesnt it transfer my information between devices???? same account, and nothing at all. subscription is active but the setup is in its base form and not the form i put it in.",1
"I admire the idea, but I'm not very active. üòÜ",1

"It's pretty good for game-ifying my tasks and keeping me on track. The only thing that would bring it to the next level is if it was formatted more like a DND character sheet, but maybe I'm just a nerd",1
Pretty great for self improvement.,1
"Amazing app, almost feels like a cheat leveling system but irl, the only thing that holds me back from giving it 5 stars, is the lack of customization, like let us import images for our icons or allow us to disable it, the colour options for the app are kinda low and the UI overall just feels old and cluncky, I would like to see a UI overhaul and make it look more cleaner and more modernized.",1
"Love the app, would give 5 stars but it's lacking one important feature: The ability to reset all tasks to their next scheduled entry, when I have a busy week at work, orna vacation I have to MANUALLY reset like 50 tasks to their next scheduled date, quite painful.",1
Would pay for any kind of basic text based rpg you could actually play with your character. Otherwise feels a little hollow. Love the idea though.,1
"Very good routine app. Perfec to create task lists, it has an alarm system to remind you in time for every task, but sometimes it didn't work as well, so I prefer the stock android watch app to do this.",1
"Love the app a lot! It could use some improvements, but the dev already works a lot on it. Because of my ADHD I always have trouble with being productive, this app however, by far is the only app that actually helps me deal with that! The only productivity app that's stayed with me for a long time!",1
"It's a bit hard to set everything up, but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style. Nice work dev team. Thanks for your time and effort.",1
"Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.",1
"The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work",1
"It's a lot of fun, good personalization. I have to make time to explore the app called more fully, I think a tutorial would be amazing, and pre-developed lists that could be tweaked.",1
Used for years. helps a ditz like me stay on top of things that I need to do and work towards short term to long term goals. Down side I found was steep learning curve to get the most out of this app but one of the best. Note: I made the one time purchase for premium futures which was worth it.,1
"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars. A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!",1
"The app is amazing so far, however, the only concern I must express is the unavailability of decreasing the exp less than 1 for skill. Everytime I try using a decimal point, the app crashes, if you could fix this 5 stars is on it's way : )",1
"It would also be really nice to see the automatic refresh actually work (google acc) between 2 connected devices. If not possible, a manual refresh button would be sufficient, but proper refreshing would be required in my opinion! Again, love the app!",1
"Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat.",1
"This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure.",1
"It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.",1
"I really like this app, it reminds me of an older app called LifeRPG, however this one gets updated. If I could make a suggestion, please unlock more of the icons or give us a way to add custom icons. I understand you need to monetize it but I think this is a bit too restrictive. Other than that I love the app.",1

"Very good UI and app in general. It's disappointing when you find features that are paid exclusive, but it doesn't distract from the basic function of the app.",1
Perfect for task reminders. I appreciate the flexibility when it comes to scheduling tasks and also the frequency of reminders. I want to like the habit generator but it so quickly fails and restarts. I am not quite understanding how to best implement it yet.,1
"Can I make task templates in this app? I can't find such option and if there's ain't such I would really like if there was, so I don't have to create every task from scratch and to be able to create my plan more easily. Nonetheless, if there is, I can't find it, so please help and consider making it more intuitive. After all my demands are fulfilled I will happily give this app 5 stars. :) Cheers.",1

It's a great app but $50 is outrageous.,1
Got sick and lost everything I worked for because I failed tasks.,1
It would be really nice if you could add subtasks that reset every day,1
"this apps helped me get better on track with my self care, i didn't spend too much time on the free version but the premium is definetly worth it at this point with a very low cost yearly payment. I love how customisable everything is, I think there could be more themes but i appreciate what's there now - there's a good selection. I do wish that there was a quick fail button in app and in the widget, though. thanks do it now team!! edit: the notification reminders ALWAYS show up as well!",1
There's no AM PM indicator when setting up time for new goals/Tasks. Everything else SMACKS!,1
"Love the app, it's fun and easy to use. I've used it on and off for a long time, and it's the most encouraging without any pressure. And i do feel committed when I set levels and achievements that reflect who I hope to be. The only thing I wish could be different is having the option of purchasing themes seperately like before.",1
Really nice but it could be decined to make it look even more better it'll surely make more people buy it I'm also gonna subscribe it permanently Please connect it with other Google apps.,1
"So far I'm enjoying the app, but it does have some glitches. ""Parent"" tasks show up as single tasks, setting dates and times can be finicky if you aren't careful, etc, but nothing too difficult to get past. It's definitely fun and motivating, I like the simple design, and I could see myself paying for the full version especially if those small issues get fixed.",1
Very nicely done. But I'm missing the floating part of the task reward amount.,1
Very good little hidden üíé,1
Amazing app but not have deadline options add it if possible.,1
"Really good app, sadly the calendar, wich is one of the most important features, is only in the premium version. I would remove more stars but the price for premium with the current discount is quite reasonable",1
"It's a great app I just with it was a little easier to use, it's pretty straight forward though.",1
"Interesting concept! Still getting used to the functionality, but this app is an effective way to gamify your to-do and task lists. Before Do it Now -RPG, I had a list of chores; Now I have a quest-list, instead. Time to go unlock some achievements!",1
"The app is great, but the constant ads and interruptions (such as offers to buy the full app) can get a bit tiring",1
"I can see how this app would be very useful, but I couldn't get myself to focus on it, and therefore it felt like an additional chore rather than a help. That's just a possible outcome when you're neurodivergent.",1
It's a cool idea but I downloaded it hoping that it would have pre-generated tasks that you could just pick and add to your list instead of having to decide the value of everything yourself.,1
lovely :),1
This app is perfect. You can discipline your activities and apply them then you will get rewards. It's perfect!!! And i think it will be good to have the ability to displace the levels in levels info....,1
The Characteristic graph is only of 1 day. It should show whole progress.,1
"Overall an amazing app.Just have one little complaint.It seems we can't customize the amount of xp required to level up skills & characteristics.Skills & characteristics level up way too fast compared to the hero's level.For example,my hero level is only 7,but my charisma level is 41! That looks a tad bit ridiculous don't you think?",1
Good and well thought out. REALLY REALLY needs a way to reorder/rearrange hero levels that you've created without having to delete or go through each one to edit it and have them in correct order if you wanted to add more levels later on.,1
"Would recommend if you like fiddling with numbers. The app works quite well, I found the task options to be quite flexible, but I ended up procrastinating actually setting up and doing tasks -so I don't think it's the right app for my brain üòÖ",1
"Fantastic app, practically flawless in practicality and design, once you get the hang of it. It has helped me establish and maintain habits and goals. It's like I'm hacking my brain with a reward system too. I get to track how my accomplished tasks influence my skills and characteristics. Only con being that the tasks duplicate after I check it off. Sometimes 2 or 3 times. I end up having to 'skip' the duplicate ones. Please fix it's seems to only be getting worse.",1
I'm loving the app itself tried to add my wife and it wouldn't send the requested to either of us that I could find. If that was fixed I would absolutely rate at 5 stars!,1
"Really cool app, the possibility to personalize almost every aspect of the planner is really nice. The only problem is that on my android phone the notifications seems to non working. Do you know why?",1
"The app helps me keep on track, but I really wish there was a way to repeat subtasks daily without having to make them again",1
I like the options though I wish there was a pause/start button when setting up so it doesn't count until you have everything entered. Also have tasks that can be daily but bonus if done multiple times. Or the option for infinite repeat tasks to show up in daily list.,1
"I enjoy using the app, but I would suggest there be LESS ads and more options for customization without buying premium.",1
"Awesome app, Can you add context for tasks",1
"Very good app, but, is there a way to have a web app?",1
"Hello! Your app is amazing! My GF and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other. But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this? Sry for my English, btw:) UPDATE: And i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed. Thank you and your team again for this great app!",1
"Really good app so far. Only problem I've experienced is when a task fails, it will take the remainder of xp from a skill or level, and then when reverted will give it back plus more.",1
"A bit underrated. It's a fun way to get things done, kind of like having a video game character. It does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money, but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding. Good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores, homework, etc, done. :-)",1
"I absolutely love the app, I've had it for a short time but I know I'll love it. This app helps me keep my day organised and be productive in a fun way! The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is simple.. So much more room for work and improvement in all directions! Keep up the great work! My personal request is a bit of work on the inventory system, as it would be great to keep track of that too. (The need for quest rewards for items is a bit wonky, but my only complaint so far)",1
"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",1
"So far I'm enjoying the app, but it does have some glitches. ""Parent"" tasks show up as single tasks, setting dates and times can be finicky if you aren't careful, etc, but nothing too difficult to get past. It's definitely fun and motivating, I like the simple design, and I could see myself paying for the full version especially if those small issues get fixed.",1
"Great app that motivates me to do stuff. I really like that I can set the penalty to 0 (punishment is not an incentive for me), although I wish there was a permanent disable option. The only big cons for me - and the reason I also keep Blitz as to-do app - is the widget, I find it quite ugly and I would have preferred round corners, a transparency option (with % choosing), task category on the right on the same line as the name, & maybe also a more subtle/material design icon for the coins.",1
"this apps helped me get better on track with my self care, i didn't spend too much time on the free version but the premium is definetly worth it at this point with a very low cost yearly payment. I love how customisable everything is, I think there could be more themes but i appreciate what's there now - there's a good selection. I do wish that there was a quick fail button in app and in the widget, though. thanks do it now team!! edit: the notification reminders ALWAYS show up as well!",1
This app is great if like me you are forgetful or just need a small reminder to do certain things. It's super cute and has a lot of customisation (in and outside of premium payments). My only complaint is that the UI is a little difficult to get your head around at first and it could do with more of a tutorial/instruction page to explain all the settings and options you have. But other than that I highly recommend this app. And for once the premium payment isn't extortionate!,1
Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,1
"It really helps with getting things done! Receiving XP, gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do. I like that - on the contrary to other apps - it is actually useful without having to get the premium version. Though the premium version is a nice addition. Suggestion: some rewards could already be existent so you don't have to come up with them yourself. I personally don't have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don't know what gold price would be appropriate.",1
"Great, but it is missing a feature that honestly has me looking elsewhere. This app would be perfect for me, except that it seems that the app only provides a ""Successful executions"" graph for a given event with a time interval of _one_ week. I'm interested in the tracking of my successful executions of an event over a long period of time, and so not having an option for a graph over a longer timeline is a bit of a bummer.",1
"I have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far, definitely worth a subscription for the full experience. Shared it with friends but unfortunately it's only available on Android. One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it. Also, wish it had a web page version like Habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their OS.",1
"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.",1
"It's great mostly. A bit buggy, but great. I have a feature request though: ability to create achievements based on execution in a row, like, clean something 10 days in a row - bam, new achievement! Right now we can create achievements based on number of task execution in general, which is cool, but not enough. Both options should be available :) Habit generation doesn't cut it. What if the activity is negative?",1
"Great app for doing everyday to-dos without fail, just to protect the virtual hero which is an extension of your real self. Fantastic gamification of everyday to-dos with plenty of features which are highly customisable. Few things I noticed are: (1) The letters on the HERO Tab are haphazardly placed and looking unprofessional. This space needs a complete redesign for a professional look. (2) The graphs on statistics page are not so appealing. Graphs should be designed in a better way.",1
"I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?",1
"It's pretty good for game-ifying my tasks and keeping me on track. The only thing that would bring it to the next level is if it was formatted more like a DND character sheet, but maybe I'm just a nerd",1
"Love the app, would give 5 stars but it's lacking one important feature: The ability to reset all tasks to their next scheduled entry, when I have a busy week at work, orna vacation I have to MANUALLY reset like 50 tasks to their next scheduled date, quite painful.",1
"The app is great and I sure would love to have more perks such as having to pick a photo from the rewards section so I could gain more motivation such as a doll of a certain series I love, kinda like buying something that is thrilling.",1
Really an awesome app for doing tasks. Helps keep track of tasks and also keep procrastination at bay. One small issue is that I don't get any reminder even I set one. Still a great app. Hope they fix the issue,1
"Amazing app, almost feels like a cheat leveling system but irl, the only thing that holds me back from giving it 5 stars, is the lack of customization, like let us import images for our icons or allow us to disable it, the colour options for the app are kinda low and the UI overall just feels old and cluncky, I would like to see a UI overhaul and make it look more cleaner and more modernized.",1
"Excellent design and features. Really fun to use. One issue is that having any kind of reminder set will permanently leave the alarm icon in my notification bar, which is confusing and annoying. That icon should only be for alarms, not app reminders.",1
"Hmm, so far it's seeming promising, I have alot of brain stuff going on and alot of my executive dysfunction comes from making decisions so its awesome you start out with default tasks to just remove unnecessary ones. The subtasks thing is something I've desperately wanted in an app for years so yesss, it might help more if there were more presets like cleaning specific rooms and what it might entail and what skills it increases. Idk if that's already a premium feature but ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
"Big fan. Went ahead and did the one time payment, because I can see me using this app for a long, long time. That said, there is room for improvement. My #1 suggestion would be custom currency. Let me make my own currency systems so I can have different tasks allowing access to different rewards. Instant 5 star right there. Custom icons would also be great, since while the built-in icons are expansive and varied, they don't always have what I'm looking for. Gameify your life, and then win it.",1
"Good app, needs more purchase options. I want to show my support for the project- but . . . I dont want all the features that come with premium, i literally just want to upload custom sounds. I dont want the scheduling or themes or any of that other stuff. Could there be more options to purchase by themselves? I want to buy features permanently since i see myself using this app for a long time, I'd be willing to spend a couple or so bucks, not the full 45$",1
"Just staryed using it. There's a pretty massive learning curve, especially when it comes to the complete customization of your character, characteristics, skills and in general ""finding the flow"" that works for you but so far it's been really helpful and an enjoyable experience.",1
So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!,1
"Was amazing until the most recent update, which took away the duration feature for the free version. Now it's only available on premium. I can still use the app as a task list without due dates (and it still works great, hence 4 stars), but I'd really like to use it for my school tasks, which I'll now have to use a different app to implement due dates on. Still a great app, I'll just have to use it differently now that the feature is gone",1
Perfect for task reminders. I appreciate the flexibility when it comes to scheduling tasks and also the frequency of reminders. I want to like the habit generator but it so quickly fails and restarts. I am not quite understanding how to best implement it yet.,1
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,1
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps",1
I like this app but I wish it could also help me moderate my food intake better ect. That seems really hard to work through. I bought the full version but there are a few things that could be improved but actually a not bad app. I asked myself if I think purchasing a yr would be a good choice for me and I have enjoyed it so far. (I also thought $12 for a yr subscription was a decent price for a organization app that can hold my attention for at least a week),1
"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks.",1
"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",1
"Very good UI and app in general. It's disappointing when you find features that are paid exclusive, but it doesn't distract from the basic function of the app.",1
"Can I make task templates in this app? I can't find such option and if there's ain't such I would really like if there was, so I don't have to create every task from scratch and to be able to create my plan more easily. Nonetheless, if there is, I can't find it, so please help and consider making it more intuitive. After all my demands are fulfilled I will happily give this app 5 stars. :) Cheers.",1
"Does the calendar in pro integrate into Google Calendar? Depending on this I'm considering buying pro. This is my ideal feature, an app that tracks my Google Calendar progress. If not I will probably drop this app, because of the work required to maintain two task apps. 5 stars if this feature comes/exists.",1
I like the options though I wish there was a pause/start button when setting up so it doesn't count until you have everything entered. Also have tasks that can be daily but bonus if done multiple times. Or the option for infinite repeat tasks to show up in daily list.,1
"i think this is great, but i dont like the fail system, failing is just as important for learning as suceeding is. the fail multiplier for EXP should be positive, (default: 30~50%) losing gold is still fine, but losing EXP doesn't make sense at all. besides is anyone setting it past 2 or 3 times?",1
"I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task. I really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app I've ever used.",1
"I love this app, pretty simple and to the point. Although choosing rewards for myself is hard. Make sure when you purchase premium you make sure you select the right plan, I ended up getting charged $17 but they have started a refund.",1
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,1
"I love this app. It turns doing tasks to a entire level up game for fun. Just one thing I want more than anything. I wish they can add where you can set it to add a random item to the rewards. Then I can randomly get items, instead of getting a certain amount of items each time. Wish they could add more. Still love it though....",1
I like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience. Skill tree. I would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills. Linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge. Some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable. It really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app.,1
This app is great! My only complaint is how complicated it is to initiate each task.. how do I know if it increase 50% discipline or 100%?,1
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks,1
"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""üìöüìóüìòüìôüììüìîicon, or ""pen""üñãüñä icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. üëç",1
"You add execution note but when I check in history it just one word that appeared, and the next is ........, I confuse how to check the details. Hope the next update, there is detail preview when tap a mission that's done in history. And also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history. Thank you for great app.",1
"Fun app to use, very customisable with the skills, just like any RPG game. I would use it a lot more if we could actually countdown the time as we are performing a task, but the app is already packed with things to do. Support team is very quick in responding too!",1
"I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more. I wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once.",1
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,1
"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks.",1
This has made so many boring little everyday tasks feel a lot more fun and rewarding. Would really like to be able to edit skill levels though. Took me a while to get the hang of making custom skills and how they synergise with base stats and tasks. And now some of them have values that don't correspond properly to actual real-life skill level compared to others.,1
"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.",1
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!,1
"Nice app with lot of options. Like the reward system. Developper look active as i read the reviews and take comment into consideration. What is fear doing in the task don t really understand. ? Ui could get some work. Not possible to have reminder on ad vitam eternam task. Don t know if possible to have multiple reminder for the same task but would be usefull Maybe a better tutorial, don t like wall of text for tutorial, something more interactive would be nice. Would love to have reward separated per group, for example i am eating healty all week long i can have a burger. I am stopping smoking + do sport i can have a new phone What would motivated me is a picture of my reward that get slowly fullfilled as I get closer to my goal Very expensive app.",1
"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list. (-)Cons: first time setup are quite challenging; literally create your own system. Icons & themes are limited (minor inconvenience). I was using LifeRPG (which seems abandoned now) so it helps with the learning curve. I see devs made lots improvement here. Recommended!",1
"I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!",1
"Really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have. Recommendation : you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills I made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures, maybe like dice roll mechanics. Would be fun to see your skill in use, cos just building them up isn't enough. Good job, add this quest system and its a complete app. Also app generated loot too...",1
"So far this app is amazing. It's exciting me to continue to work towards my goals. As a person who loves video games and anime, I set goals thinking of myself as a main character. Everytime I lose, I lose my points and all my experience. When I win, I gain experience and perform good habits, transforming me to new heights.",1
"Great app for setting up to do list and setting skills, very similar to LifeRPG, differing only in UI and the addition of achievements in my opinion. Stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app. Would prefer one off payment to unlock features.",1
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.",1
"Love the app, it's fun and easy to use. I've used it on and off for a long time, and it's the most encouraging without any pressure. And i do feel committed when I set levels and achievements that reflect who I hope to be. The only thing I wish could be different is having the option of purchasing themes seperately like before.",1
"It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",1
"Overall an amazing app.Just have one little complaint.It seems we can't customize the amount of xp required to level up skills & characteristics.Skills & characteristics level up way too fast compared to the hero's level.For example,my hero level is only 7,but my charisma level is 41! That looks a tad bit ridiculous don't you think?",1
"Perfect, the ""life rpg"" that actually gets updates as i always wanted. 2 things i would like to see: 1. Please, for the love of god, brand the app and learn a bit about branding, do you have any idea how hard it is to find content for an app called ""do it now""? 2. Quick capture: (a small one, maybe unnecessary) where you can capture a task in 10 seconds so you when you have the time you could set the reward and the states, also so you don't forget it and give you a headache trying to remember.",1
very good app I have a suggestion to add subskills because I'm a handyman and know how to use the drill the hammer etc and adding those its too much woulbe better handyman skill> drill,1
I like this app but I wish it could also help me moderate my food intake better ect. That seems really hard to work through. I bought the full version but there are a few things that could be improved but actually a not bad app. I asked myself if I think purchasing a yr would be a good choice for me and I have enjoyed it so far. (I also thought $12 for a yr subscription was a decent price for a organization app that can hold my attention for at least a week),1
"This is an awesome app! I initially thought the idea of ""gamifying"" my life was a little silly, but fun. After trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than I ever thought! üòÅ Thank you, this is finally getting me into habits I have been trying to develop. One thing I have difficulty with is the subtasks; once I complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task. However, the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5-stars! Edit: Issue Resolved :D",1
"This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you.",1
"I have ADHD and this app helps me break down tasks and motivate myself by setting up rewards. This is worth subscribing to because it receives ongoing updates and the creater responds to feedback and suggestions. This app makes getting things done more rewarding and fun, and is a great way to organize my to-do list. It also helps remind me to do things that have a due date.",1
"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists",1
"Perfectly what I enjoy about having a todo list is the reward of seeing progress stack up in skills and attributes (characteristics). The customization of everything is amazing. If you take the time to think and setup the rpg details of the todo list to reflect on a character you have in mind, it's fun to see the progress. I felt the extra desire to complete tasks I would otherwise procrastinate on without the app, and I find that really worth its value. I highly recommend this app. 5 stars.",1
"Awesome reminder app. This one actually motivates you to complete tasks because it shows you your progress and the ui is easy to use. It's very customizable, from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks. The free version also allows the use of almost all of its features and doesn't hinder you in any way. I'm considering getting a subscription, but mostly because I want to support the creators of the app that has improved my daily life.",1
"I'm loving this app for an extra motivation boost for my daily tasks. One feature I'd like to see would be a library of pre-filled tasks with the option to add without manually adding them myself but keeping the same ability to customize and perhaps having new tasks encouraged/offered at each level up. I do love the duplicate function though, time saver! Having weekly tasks not requiring a specific date would be nice too. Overall great app!",1
"The app is great, its free version is somewhat limiting, but it's more than usable. There are a few things that are a bit underdeveloped, but they don't break the purpose of the app. One thing that I dislike in particular is the inability to hide inventory items that are not in stock; it's quite misleading seeing an item in the inventory but not being able to use it. Other than that, the app is great and has a great deal of customization for a robust rpg tasker.",1
"I've been trying my hand at self improvement for over a year, and I really wish I had this app back then. It's been a real struggle for me to keep at it after so long, and this app makes things very exciting for me again. Also, I was thinking this game might be a little more fun if there was a daily boss challenge for when you finish all your tasks, and implement some kind of roll system with your stats giving it a boost.",1
"I have been using this app for about two years now. Very cool idea. I have seen other people complain about setup pain. I found that if you create templates, then duplicate them, you can make missons with ease. (Long press on task, get a check mark, tap three dots top right, duplicate... a new copy is created with a ""1"" at the end. Do a few tweeks on your new mission to fill your needs and save) The developer is actively involved with this App for which I am thankful.",1
"Fun, free, and heavily customizable. If you are a gamer, even in the casual sense, this is the app for you. 

*Edit* (2.1.2020) : One problem to note is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to renew overdue tasks. By which I mean in other apps I can usually refresh them all with one click so that the tasks are due today. Would love an option for that, since otherwise I have to go into each task and set it to be due today. TT^TT",1
"Great app! I would love if we could add a streak option, where you get more coins every day that you do something daily. So if you keep up a habit you get more rewarded. I'd also love to see more of a celebration when you hit a goal and your level changes, like a quick confetti shower or something. I love the reward feature of the app for spending your coin. Could the app come with some suggested rewards? A leader board might also be motivating! Great app, I love it. Just some suggestions!",1
"I just discovered you can change the time and date when you complete a task! If I didn't have time yesterday to log in I can still collect my tasks without having a weird double day on my trackers. Very customizable and easy to add tasks and skills. There are ways to adjust the XP you earn it and it could be overwhelming, but you don't have to change any settings if you don't want to.",1
"(EDIT: I DELETED AND REINSTALLED THE APP IT WORKS NOW YAY. Never mind what I wrote earlier.) I love this app but I can't give it 5 stars because the app crashes every single time I try to load my own notification sounds. One of the reasons why I bought a subscription was for changing all of the sounds to Breath of the Wild sound effects, but I can't do that now. It worked for 3 of the sounds, but now none of the sounds can be changed without the app crashing.",1
"This is a great application for forming habits and improving yourself and your life. It is extremely customizable and has a lot of tracking information. I've recommended this to all of my friends to take advantage of the friends features, even giving tasks to my friends! The paid version is affordable, but everything you need is available in the free version.",1
"Just on personal preference alone, this is by far my favorite of these kinds of apps! The options and ability to set your own skills and characteristics is done very well. So are the graphs and charts to visually represent them. My only critiques are that the calendar is a bit lacking (almost useless) and there is no supporting web/desktop app, and no integrations with other apps. If had all those things, this app would be top of its class!",1
"So cool. It's like having a Pipboy! Absolutely awesome, and the developer is a badass. : D Seeing that the developer takes suggestions, I wanted to add a couple of things that may improve user friendliness. Adjusting the time frames of the repetition of tasks can be a little confusing. After playing with things a bit, it became easier to identify how to make things repeat when you want them to, and identify what the terms mean and do. Another thing I noticed was: when you're altering the Importance/Gold Generated/Difficulty/Etc, it would be helpful if the bar snapped to different increments. I love the way you can customize it in extreme detail, but I think it would be easier use if you could not only enter a number into it, but also click the bar without hitting a completely random number. I think the initial set up would be slightly easier if there were more examples or explanations (like in the beginning when you're first getting acclimated) for how things COULD be set up. Nothing beats trial and error, but it does take some time. Lastly, I'm a huge fan of widgets on my phone, and I love the idea of having a widget for this that ends all widgets. I would absolutely LOVE if the free version's widget was a little more fun and informative. The list is great, and simple, but I would be INFINITELY more invested in this app if the Widget had some more details on it... A smaller icon of my Character image at my level, maybe some differences between the fonts (sizes, colors, or stylization), with stats displayed in a less linear way... I think a border around the outside of the widget would really make it pop. All of that being said, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app. I'm considering purchasing the full thing once I finish completely setting my character up. Of course, there's always room to improve anything, please keep up the great work!",1
"Love this app. It's fun and engaging, it makes creating a to do list enjoyable. I've been using it to help keep track of my progress quitting smoking, and while most of the rewards and feedback are for appearances sake, that visual guide has been helpful in gauging my progress. Definitely recommended, has helped me find that little bit of motivation I needed in a lot of areas.",1
"My favorite habit-gamification app so far, after trying a few. Definitely minimalistic compared to Habitica, but it makes up for it in just being more functional, and with a much better system for attaching relative value/importance to various habits/to-do tasks/etc. All habit apps face the fact that it's hard to put actual numbers to how much a good habit should be ""worth"", and that scoring points you set can feel a bit like digging up treasure you buried. Do It Now handles it all well, tho",1
Thank you for making this amazing app and thank you for having a free version. I love it so far. I've noticed others leaving ideas so here's one: add an option to make decay of skills contingent on whether or not certain tasks are done. Ex. If I don't study Spanish for 3 days (variable time frame) my Spanish skill loses exp. However if I do study then no decay ocures. Thanks again for the awesome app!,1
"This app is great! You get to personalize your skills and characteristics to fit your liking. And by finishing tasks, which you create, you will earn experience toward leveling up your overall character level and your skill levels. My only wish is that i could do more with my character. Like, it would be cool if i could level up my character doing irl acrivities and then use that character to fight monsters or something, but i guess that would defeat the purpose of the app, which is motivation.",1
"right off the bat I am amazed with this app. it appeals to something I didn't even know I needed, but now I see that having a quest style to-do list is really the best way to go. I only wish there could be a game attached just to take it that next level up. because having a character with levels and gold is fun and all, but past that there isn't really anything to do with it. it's all arbitrary. but playing a video game where you have to accomplish real world tasks to level up? would be genius.",1
"Not the most easy app, per say. But in a way, that is the biggest advantage of this app. You can customize so much and make it super simply or super complex. It creates an engaging experience, adds another layer to my motivation to keep up with my bigger goals while managing my daily, weekly, and monthly routinely tasks. After about 2 weeks I upgraded to premium - you can get by without it but I simply wanted to open all of the features available and support the team. My most useful app!",1
"What an amazing Application, the idea of this is just perfect for my lifestyle and personality, it really helps me organize my life in a fun way. I would really like to see consumables give you some sort of experience gain or loss. For example, consuming a beer decreases your health or fitness stats. It would be interesting for sure. There are so many things you guys can add, I'm excited to see more development. Edit: I thought about that as well, I have lots of ideas, I'll send an email",1
"Great app! With ADHD, work is hard and doesn't feel like progress... With Do It Now, it feels like a productive game! I can see my tasks dwindle down, hear the sound of success, and see my gold, experience, and skills go up. It could use some way to order your tasks (ex: dragging them up/down) but since I'm really using it to avoid slacking off academically, ""class"" repeated is fine. I urge you to try the app- it's pretty intuitive and took me 15 minutes or so to set up. I love it already, and it's made me nearly twice as productive!",1
"I am liking this app alot. I use so many do it lists, but none of their reminder features give me notifications on time as accurately as this one! One thing I would like though, is when its time for reminders, it gives me a big screen that tells me what I planned for that day. Since I have attention problems, it would be easy sometimes for me to miss things that are right in front of me, so having a big screen for reminders would be really helpful.",1
"Easy to use, LOTS of features and customization w/ premium. You mostly have to define your own levels, xp, rewards, etc., which is a little less motivating, but it's still pretty useful. I like that you can define your own skills/characteristics and select which ones and by how much they improve with completion of each tasks. The widget is also super helpful. One thing I wish they'd add is the option of uploading your own emojis for to-dos. Also, the custom color picker needs a bit of work.",1
"Great app, very customizable. Little bit of learning curve understanding how everything works, but it isn't hard & totally worth the effort. Top things I would love to see in furture update: ability to change icon colors; ability to add achievments based on hero level; ability to add XP multiplier to achievements; ability to edit default achievements; ability to sort invetory alphabetically & by number available/have",1
"Gamifying my life is actually helping me get on track with tasks that I've up until now been unsuccessfully trying to incorporate into my life. I usually don't like the concept of gamification but in this case, since you set up the tasks, levels, skills, and achievements yourself, it doesn't feel like manipulation. Highly recommend this app.",1
"Fantastic app! If you're someone who loves video games, and loves having access to stats and whatnot this app is for you. Being able to create and track nearly any and all data is so satisfying. I have a list of tasks for work, one for home, one for doing things for my son, one for my fitness goals, one for learning languages. Just so many different ways you can create tasks, challenges, and stay on track with your life. You are able to control so much! Thank you for this app!",1
"I love using this app for myself to help me prioritize/organize my time for school, homework, and playing. One thing I would love to see in here is an option where you can have multiple characters so a parent can get the app on their phone and make a character for each child so that they can keep track of what their child has done and what rewards they can have, ex: playing games, extra dessert, screen time, etc.",1
"This is the best, most customizable, app around. I appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such. The app has grown over the years, and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes. It's actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because I can just make everything to my taste all in one app. It really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore, and for a gamer like me, that's golden. Real life questing is fun!",1
"Best app by far. This app looks great, it helps me try new things and stick to a plan. Cause we know its hard to make a plan in your head and keep it. Anyway this app as lots of great features, my fav is you can make any task you want. I was going to give it four stars but then i saw how they respond to alot of the reviews and try to fix whats wrong. Their are a few bugs but thats it. The bugs inculde, crashing every now and then, when i made a task once it wouldnt show up, i had to close app",1
"As someone who struggles with the negative effects of ADHD and motivation, this helps massivley to ensure I do tasks, thank you. For everyone who likes RPGs, it takes some setup time to personalise, but it is worth it and I would reccomend it. Only feedback/request I could have is that it would be nice if 'skills' could be nested within other skills, e.i a piano skill nested under the music skill which feeds into a characteristic.",1
"I've only been using this app for a few days but it's been improving my life already. I am so excited to see the progress in my life 90 days from now. You can gamify the daily tasks you need or want to get done, create rewards, and start leveling yourself up. I watched a great video on YouTube about the concepts of gamification before I got started editing my setup and I continue to add tasks and rewards as inspiration strikes. Good luck on your quest!",1
"This app is very customizable, which I definitely wanted in an RPG style To Do list. However, it does come at a cost, since getting everything set up how you'd like takes much longer than similar apps. Personally I think the trade is worth it (hence my rating), but be aware that if you're looking for something more simple, this probably isnt the app for you. If you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work, pick this one over the others!",1
"Easily the best task app I've ever used. It speaks to the nerd in me and I'm drawn to use it and customize it, as if it were an RPG...which I guess is the whole point. I would love if it offered the ability to set ongoing tasks ""twice a day"", ""three times a day"" etc, but otherwise it's perfect.",1
"Honestly, the only to do list that makes me happy to do my tasks. The simplicity of the point chart on the main page has a great aesthetic and it makes me happy to complete difficult tasks. I have to admit I haven't yet tried bribing myself through the items screen but it's an awesome task planner.",1
"Incredible app, Made a huge difference in working on my goals, routines and habbits. The only thing that I hope will be added is that there is a pc/online version. This would make structuring and creating tasks so much easier as this can be very difficult and time consuming to set up on the mobile app",1
"Awesome app for making small, mundane tasks far more satisfying! I highly recommend buddying up with a friend (or small group), setting up a system together, and comparing graphs and statistics regularly, either as motivation, or a competition! Amazing way to start new, good habits.",1
"This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free.",1
"This app is a GAME first (imo), then a planner & habit tracker. For a moderate gamer, this app is beyond EPIC. You can make the game play as easy or as complicated as you want. If you purchase the yearly [$15.99] the possibilies are nearly endless! There are reading instructions provided, for a more non gaming person. I have some ADHD issues, which cause me to have to adapt to the ""normal"" world. This definitely will hold my interest for a little while! Thank you, please don't ruin it [devs]!",1
"Honestly it helps encourage you quite a bit, kind of sucks I have to fail tasks and lose money and XP and then if you're honest about it instead of the auto failure that's always kind of a kick you'll be sitting there and all of a sudden something fails LOL it's definitely motivated me a lot Note to the developers Just wanted to say thanks for making this app. Honestly it's motivate me to get my mental health in check. Because I can literally track anything",1
"I've only had this app for a couple of days but it's already helped me so much! I've tried a LOT of planner-type apps but I never felt motivated to follow through with them. This app allows you to make schedules and tasks, and it has a reward system in place! I've had a hard time focusing with all this online school stuff, but my productivity has shot up due to this app :) definitely worth a try. Thank you devs!",1
"BEST APP EVER! You can customize your skills and tie skills to characteristics. Awesome number of options on tasks. Set up rewards for your progress (ex: create a ""Buy 1 [item you really want] once you reach a certain level of skill"" reward) That way you can motivate yourself with IRL rewards as well as reaching in-app levels.",1
"One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app.",1
"I love the idea of this app. The customizability and effectiveness of this app are it's strongest features. It does take a while to understand how to setup and figure out the ins and outs of the app, but once you do it's super easy. One feature I'd love to see included is having rewards and items image customizable like the hero level",1
"Great app for those who enjoy analyzing and quantifying and have trouble sticking to routines. Ive heard complaints that it takes a long time to program a task in, but i found analyzing the task to be fun! It really gets me to think about how important i think tasks are. There were times i had to rethink my priorities. Creating routines and habits are a challenge irl, but this app serves as the driving force to remind me how well i am doing or where i need to adjust to succeed.",1
"*request* (setting day start & end time, e.g. 3am not 12am) Extremely cool idea, and a phenomenal execution! This is like a gamification on being a healthy human. There are SO many little details that really make this app shine! I love that it is not on the head with the mental wellbeing that it is promoting, it just makes it seem like a fun game! To expand on the gamification of it, I think a secondary app with little mini games where your character and it's stats and skills affect the game!",1
"S‚óã far, s‚óã good... This app is useful for what it intends to do and is somewhat motivating to try to keep up with tasks. I really like the ""level up my character"" mentality to a task list. I'm still trying to figure it out, though, (as it isn't clear) how to set up the tasks well to accomplish what you want. If in a few months I am still using it, I will update this review.",1
Amazing app with excellent customer support! This has taken so much stress off my shoulders. Just being able to track the thousand things I'm constantly juggling in my head is a huge help! The system is easy to navigate and highly customizable. Reward system is awesome! Great job! Please continue to optimize this and I will continue to sub :),1
"I LOVE this app. I had tried Habit RPG and I liked the generalized idea behind it but wished it was more in depth & video game like, that you could not only lvl up but gain skill points, this is extremely detailed, even has characteristics you can lvl up as well as skills & allows for complete customization in everything. Being a nerd & someone who lacks discipline, I forsee this to be an extremely useful tool to help me stay on task, achieve my goals and feel like I am ACTUALLY lvling up IRL!!!",1
"I love this app. I use it for motivation with my writing. I custimized the skills, characteristics, achievements, and my hero levels to reflect my writerly ways and it's been so fun to use! Watching my skills and levels increase is a blast. I also appreciate the"" rewards""options, but wish I could create""in-app"" rewards for myself. Like potions or consumables that could increase a skill or boost XP earning for one day, etc. Even without that, though, this app is amazing! I highly recommend it.",1
"Good app... Relatively easy, with out being too simplistic... Rpg aspects are engaging but not excessively time consuming! Calendar is 'paid access', which is a little annoying, but certainly understandable... Popup ads are mostly brief (as should be), and far enough between, they are acceptable enough... All in all, best 'RPG ToDo list' I've tried...!",1
"Love it, incredibly useful and I feel like a superhero growing in a gamification style system that tracks my lifestyle and productivity... Great product. The only thing I need is an online opportunity, it is hard to use the interface exclusively on the phone because it is such an interactive interface, this would really expand on the product usage, I can't pull my phone out at work, but could open a website.",1
"Highly recommend. It's basically what you learn to do in cognitive behavioral therapy, but it's sneaky so it took me a while to figure out that's what it was doing. It's very flexible and customizable, and helps me to actually meet goals. Then I can use my gold for rewards (which you set up yourself - hello Amazon wishlist).",1
It's a really great app I love most that it reminds you about your tasks since I tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it's easy and fun to use especially with the reward system I think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly I love the app it's perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need,1
"Most amazing task organizer. Everything is customizable and easy to understand. Functions perfectly whether you use every detail of the app or just basic task lists. I'm Pavlov-ing myself with the task completion noise and my serotonin levels are through the roof. I've never wanted to give anyone money before but I 100% would buy every add-on, even though I don't need to, because I can do almost everything for free (HOORAY) THANK YOU SO MUCH",1
"This is the best app of its kind I've found. It does everything the others do, but I orefer this one's UI. Though I would recommend automatically saving changes when editing tasks or at least prompting the user to save because I often find myself pressing the back arrow instead of the ok button, causing me to have to redo the edits and press ok to save.",1
This is exactly what I was looking for on my tablet! Suggestion: be able to create multiple heroes for specific character goals for example switch from a body builder hero or dad hero and have an overall hero that combines all of your stats you have gained. Also I don't know if it's already implemented but have stats deteriorate over time the less you work on them. Thank you for this app!,1
"In the few days I've downloaded this app my habit consistency improved 10 fold! Other apps don't give any incentive to get what's on your to do list done beside your own will power; which isn't a bad thing but the extra kick from the stats, the coins and the rewards you can redeem with them, and the achievements help. I also love how customizable the app is, for me at least being able to create your own rewards and achievements makes the app fit me personally.",1
Personally I absolutely love this app and it is exactly mathematically what I have been looking for. The only true inconvenience is that once the day is over you cannot go back and add tasks to a day. Developers could you pretty pretty pretty please with sugar on top make it possible for us to go back and add tasks that we have completed on previous days!?! Maybe in the calendar area or something! Thank you kindly! üôè‚ù£Ô∏è Revision: 5 star! Thank you for responding and teaching me hot to edit task!,1
"The most affordable and customizable RPG To do list out there. Truly create yourself as a character and level up in life! The only thing it's missing is a better family/clan system so my family and I can share attributes and assign tasks, require multiple peoplw complete a task, or allow anyone to complete a task. All of those tasks could affect personal stats and/or the family/clan stats. That would be perfect.",1
"Absolutely love this app! Helps motivate and keep on track, while having plenty of features and customizable things to look through. Even so, I hope they find a more specific thing to spend coins on such as pets, clothes, or any kind of collectible. Besides that It's a very lovely, and fun game. Very recommendable!",1
Used for years. helps a ditz like me stay on top of things that I need to do and work towards short term to long term goals. Down side I found was steep learning curve to get the most out of this app but one of the best. Note: I made the one time purchase for premium futures which was worth it.,1
"ADHD hack life. You can set the difficulty level and the ""fear"" (aversion) level for each task (all tasks are made up by the user) and level up your ""character"" in specific exp like 'productivity' 'hygiene' 'communication' etc. Tasks can be repeated, or individual, or just reset after you complete it once. It's been awesome for me so far. I hate putting it that I ""failed"" a task, and watching my character lose points. And getting points and staying good gives me the dopamine I need.",1
"I like the concept, but the widget doesn't update from day to day. I tried both daily and continuous, and it just stays the way it was the day before, despite any repeating/ continuous tasks. I find myself having to remove the widget and replace it every day. Please fix. Thanks for the otherwise great app. (P.S. I'm on android 11 if that helps fix the issue btw.) Edit: Thanks for the response. It worked.",1
"The app is amazing so far, however, the only concern I must express is the unavailability of decreasing the exp less than 1 for skill. Everytime I try using a decimal point, the app crashes, if you could fix this 5 stars is on it's way : )",1
"Really good app so far. Only problem I've experienced is when a task fails, it will take the remainder of xp from a skill or level, and then when reverted will give it back plus more.",1
"Not very straight forward to edit/make your own goals and tasks. Other than that, lots of customization and a nice UI.",1
"For an app that's supposed to help organize your life, it isn't very organized. I absolutely live the idea, but how is a task for today actually one from 5 days ago? I can't brush my teeth 5 days ago right now bro. The task for the next day shows up and it confuses me all the time and makes me think, ""but didn't I do that this morning? Oh wait that's from 3 days ago. Then why is it still there?"" I have ADHD so this really messes with me. The app as a whole tho is really cool and I love it!",1
"Mr. Lozovyi, I hope you and your family are safe during this war crisis. We hope that this issue will be resolved soon. Good Wishes! #People of India stand with Ukrainians. üôè Weekly/monthly/yearly Comparison is highly needed to keep ourselves motivated. Time Based /expiring date for unlocking achievements should be introduced. #Crash on search",1
"I love this app. It turns doing tasks to a entire level up game for fun. Just one thing I want more than anything. I wish they can add where you can set it to add a random item to the rewards. Then I can randomly get items, instead of getting a certain amount of items each time. Wish they could add more. Still love it though....",1
"Please add a timer. It can be linked to certain tasks, so that one can create a termless, duration based tasks.",1
Pretty handy to have. Not sure if worth money yet. Check back in 3 months.,1
"Good,",1
"Great app, but I'd love to see streaks for tasks...",1
Really like it! But please make this for ios too! Recently bought an iphone and found out I cannot use this app anymore,1
"So far this app is amazing. It's exciting me to continue to work towards my goals. As a person who loves video games and anime, I set goals thinking of myself as a main character. Everytime I lose, I lose my points and all my experience. When I win, I gain experience and perform good habits, transforming me to new heights.",1
"I think this is a great app especially for those with ADHD. However there are some slight improvements I think could be made. 1. I would like to be able to change the times that a task can be done more easily, just because I'm only up during the night. 2. I wish I could change how much XP and Gold I lose for failing a task separately. 3. It would be nice to be able to set up a custom default setting for task. But besides those few things I do really love the app.",1
A bit too much,1
"I really like this app and the concept, but I feel that it should be possible to see your friends profile, and in general it would be good to add the ability to interact with your friends in some ways apart from assigning tasks",1
"Hmm, so far it's seeming promising, I have alot of brain stuff going on and alot of my executive dysfunction comes from making decisions so its awesome you start out with default tasks to just remove unnecessary ones. The subtasks thing is something I've desperately wanted in an app for years so yesss, it might help more if there were more presets like cleaning specific rooms and what it might entail and what skills it increases. Idk if that's already a premium feature but ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
"Very good routine app. Perfec to create task lists, it has an alarm system to remind you in time for every task, but sometimes it didn't work as well, so I prefer the stock android watch app to do this.",1
"Does the calendar in pro integrate into Google Calendar? Depending on this I'm considering buying pro. This is my ideal feature, an app that tracks my Google Calendar progress. If not I will probably drop this app, because of the work required to maintain two task apps. 5 stars if this feature comes/exists.",1
"It's nice. Constant reminder of what to do, cute. Wish they let you pick a woman / non man avatar but other than that it's ok",1
This app is great if like me you are forgetful or just need a small reminder to do certain things. It's super cute and has a lot of customisation (in and outside of premium payments). My only complaint is that the UI is a little difficult to get your head around at first and it could do with more of a tutorial/instruction page to explain all the settings and options you have. But other than that I highly recommend this app. And for once the premium payment isn't extortionate!,1
I am facing some problems:- ‚Ä¢How do I add Imventory Items that I created into rewards.. PLEASE üÜò HELP,1
Is possible to give buff toward exp of some skills after i done a task?,1
"UI is a bit clunky for changing a task from one-off to repeating; requires clicking several menus deep and isn't obvious at first glance. No support for nesting tasks into checklists. Gamification is nice, though.",1
"Perfect, the ""life rpg"" that actually gets updates as i always wanted. 2 things i would like to see: 1. Please, for the love of god, brand the app and learn a bit about branding, do you have any idea how hard it is to find content for an app called ""do it now""? 2. Quick capture: (a small one, maybe unnecessary) where you can capture a task in 10 seconds so you when you have the time you could set the reward and the states, also so you don't forget it and give you a headache trying to remember.",1
"Quality app, none of that character building BS. Just missing public leader board.",1
"I just installed the app, and so far, it looks really helpful! I'm excited to use it in my everyday life. However, the one thing that made me sad was that there isn't a hero icon that has a wheelchair. I'm disabled, and having an icon that reflects that about me would be really nice.",1
Hello can you please make it so that we can manually sort the subtasks? That would make it perfect and then I would give this 5üåü,1
"Great app for doing everyday to-dos without fail, just to protect the virtual hero which is an extension of your real self. Fantastic gamification of everyday to-dos with plenty of features which are highly customisable. Few things I noticed are: (1) The letters on the HERO Tab are haphazardly placed and looking unprofessional. This space needs a complete redesign for a professional look. (2) The graphs on statistics page are not so appealing. Graphs should be designed in a better way.",1
"I do not ""identify"" as a male. I am a woman. Where are your female avatars? God bless the Ukraine!",1
"This app has amazing potential. I found it looking for points maker for vacation trip scavenger hunt. Needs shared rewards, secret rewards for others. Getting many decaying skills when turned off. Needs XP requirements for rewards. A lot of potential",1
"PRO: I *love* the fact that it provides a framework for first deciding WHO you want to be (characteristics), then HOW to get there (skills & habits). CONS: - To use the app in that way is not intuitive, and there is a long learning curve to get there. - Ads are obtrusive. The inclusion of audio limits where I can use the app, which makes it less useful. - User guide is not always clear enough. - Reward system needs more robust explanation. - A few more free icons would be nice.",1
"S√≥ falta ter a op√ß√£o ""miss√£o pai"" que tem o LifeRPG que fica perfeito!",1
"Hello I love the app it's by far the best ""life RPG"" app I've used. But I have 1 problem that I would greatly appreciate if you could help me with How do I enable notifications for it? I want the app to tell me when an activity is to be proformed in the same why that google calander does it by showing a notification on the home screen If there is an option to eneble this then how do I do it? Please I would greatly appreciate a reply",1
"It really feels like I have a tabletop character sheet for myself, and I didn't even know I wanted it until now. The skill and stat customization is incredibly deep. The reward system is great. I highly recommend the premium, if you can afford it. These devs deserve it, and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions.",1
"A little grind to set it up but it keeps me motivated when I'm in my depressive ruts, because it gives me a sense of accomplishment which in turn motivates me.üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èIt's truly a smart algorithm, it gives you brain feel good chemicals for doing mundane things that you may have trouble doing even though its easy and quick. Its very detailed so its fully customizable, and you can just tell that this app is from pure passion I love this app, but I'd like to reiterate the slow setup will take awhile.",1
"I use this to keep track of habits and tasks that's sometimes get ingonred! Never had I made a list I felt so compelled to complete! This app can show how often I get things done or how often I've been ignoring things! Separating daily tasks with categories for Health, Mindfulness, Housekeeping, and work to keep separate tasks organized. The ability to organize based on importance. the only thing missing is integration with personal calendar instead of built-in calendar would be highly useful!",1
"I really love this app! When I use it I guarantee I'm accomplishing more than I would when I don't. My absolute favorite feature is the circle charts, thank you for keeping those around they're visually so helpful! The achievements I love for setting up things I really should do multiple times, like drinking 8oz. of water. I joined up with their subreddit too, and subscribed for the next 6 months because it's so awesome and they keep doing work on it so I love supporting the project! Keep it up team, can't wait to see what else you do.",1
"It would be nice to have the ability to set an xp/coins decay until a particular task is completed. Also, would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time (rather than editing its time and resetting it, or duplicating it). Also, maybe add search ability for filtering icons (as there are so many).",1
"It's the best!! You get money and XP every time you complete a task, and you can take the money and buy rewards that you can set up for yourself. You can also set achievements for yourself. It has tons of different themes for premium users that are so cool! But it's set up where even if you aren't a premium user you can still use the app fully, there are no restrictions on basic needed functions. It's absolutely awesome!!!",1
"Great app! I love how you can customize it to fit your own style. Want fantasy rpg quests? This app can do it. More of a business style? It can do that too. It can be streamlined and minimalist or it can be detailed -diving deep into skills and stats. I especially like how it starts you off with a few tasks that are well balanced, providing a great foundation to build into habit routines. This app is really encouraging and makes productivity and personal growth super fun and easy.",1
"I really love having my habits in this system. It's so easy to keep track of them now, and see how well I am doing, or not doing. It's clear when I need to adjust something to perform better. I am definitely habitualizing things much easier. The gamification part adds no fun for me, and I think the merge of productivity and gamification leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a start and hopefully they keep learning and improving. I do like the sound effects.",1
"Great app to gamify to do list and tasks. Very customizable in regards to icons, colors, and skills. I have not dived into the newest updates to see if there are new features. The downside could be an upside for some. When first organizing tasks it can be easy to get overwhelmed with options. No side game to slay dragons like one game to-do list manager I saw. It does a good job of being an annoying reminder to get tasks done (assuming you set deadlines).",1
"This is amazing and worthy of subscription, though I would very much rather pay one solid fee for the unlockables. (and I don't mean cheap - I would pay at LEAST $10 to own this and receive updates; It's THAT good!) This app has everything I need, and now my girlfriend is going to join in, too! It has so much limitless potential that you have complete control of. All it takes is a little bit of self-discipline, but there would be no actual pleasure in cheating at this sort of game anyway.",1
"I am starting with only some small daily tasks and keeping their xp and gold gain low to build the foundation. I like the ability to design our own rewards and hero growth. It allows me to go the slow burn route while I am sure others enjoy the quick leveling that is possible. I have not encountered any issues with it. The only thing I wish it had was the ability to have something repeat weekly or monthly without being on specific days or dates, but that is pretty minor.",1
"This app makes YOUR life an RPG. This is more useful than LifeRPG, in that it is task-oriented, completing tasks increases skills and gold, skills increase character stats, and gold can be used to buy things you've been wanting. It's almost a perfect cue-routine-reward system. Tasks can have subtasks, but I'd like to see Quests with subtasks that give a certain item for completing the quest--in addition to the current setup of gold. Then again, simplicity is really appreciated and I wouldn‚Äôt want the app to get more and more complicated due to unnecessary feature requests! This is pretty much the app I‚Äôd always dreamed of. Subscribed.",1
"I love the app and it's customizablity with some notes; repeats are confusing and not easy to work about (for instance repeat times during one day versus general repeats), moving tasks to different days (calendar drag?) , can set specific times on multiple reminders, making routines, changes easy to lose when pressing back, and unable to manually order tasks by preference in list form. Adding stars for great responsiveness and care of creator =D",1
"I have only spent a day with this app, but I know that I will spend a great deal of time with it in the future. Pros: Highly versatile and fast. This app can be designed to fit any goal and can be tuned to fit any RPG balancing you want. Nearly everything is customizable. It's also fast. From first tap of the app to checking off accomplished tasks it takes just a couple seconds. Cons: Perfecting the customization to the RPG experience you want can take a long time, but it's worth it.",1
"I LOVE this app!! It's a total game changer for my life. Unlike other habit tracker apps that motivate based on meeting goals (which doesn't really work for me), this one motivates me by tying task completion directly to leveling up my life - which is something I really care about! Plus earning gold to buy ""rewards"" helps me with discipline, so that I stop over-indulging. And the level of customization in this app is simply astounding. I can't recommend it enough!",1
"It is the best app available to gamify your life. It requires integrity, but everyone I cheat myself I reset it, which drives me to work even harder and do more. It suggested a good amount of stuff, but you can take the framework, and completely change every single thing which is what makes it incredible. The layout and format is also clean, while being unique. I think everyone should use this around the world.",1
A nice app for the game minded to track you tasks. Simple in display. I haven't explored the paid version yet.,1
"i think this is great, but i dont like the fail system, failing is just as important for learning as suceeding is. the fail multiplier for EXP should be positive, (default: 30~50%) losing gold is still fine, but losing EXP doesn't make sense at all. besides is anyone setting it past 2 or 3 times?",1
There are bugs but overall it is a good app.,1
Feels empowering when you check it off your list!,1
so far so good.,1
Dark screen widgets need brighter text,1
"It would be amazing if you let us have multiple profiles, apart from that, is an amazing appüòä",1
I would give it five stars but if you could not put in tasks. And just let the user put tasks in then that would be awsome,1
A bit complicated but stell good in General,1
"Of productivity apps I've tried this year, this and Fabulous are the ones I've found most useful. Conceptualize self as RPG char: tasks improve skills, which improve traits. See progress over time. Many customization options, but don't get too complicated too fast! (My big mistake early on.) You can set unfulfilled tasks to auto-skip but the mechanic's a bit unwieldy. My biggest complaint is how stingy the freebie version is with icons: e.g. out of 50+ clothes, 60+ animals, you get ONE EACH.",1
"Good application but lacks many features like Chronological order of tasks,tutorial video about all app features would be good",1
"Excellent design and features. Really fun to use. One issue is that having any kind of reminder set will permanently leave the alarm icon in my notification bar, which is confusing and annoying. That icon should only be for alarms, not app reminders.",1
Is Good and I'm thinking about getting premium but can you level up endlessly or is it only up to level 8?,1
"Excellent customization, calendar could use a little love. Loved the app for giving me that extra motivation to build good habits! I'd love to see a little more in terms of organization options. Currently the app puts your tasks in order of time due, then alphabetically, with no option to sort them differently. I'd like to be able to separate my daily tasks from other tasks, so they don't clog up my list and my calendar view. The ability to hide dailies from the calendar view would be great!",1
"I really enjoy and look forward to using this app. I create a new icon every 2 character levels & that's a big motivator for me. I do have 2 things I wish were incorporated, 1, I wish there was a way to manually reorder the individual tasks in the hero tab (if there is one, I haven't figured it out) & 2, I'd like to be able to manually dock individual Characteristics & Skills that are falsely inflated due to bad impact percentages (on my part) from when I was figuring it out. Worth every penny",1

"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",1
"I loved the widget feature, especially the screen animation pop up along with fun music when completing a task. However, I don't think it's as fun as habitify which has more RPG elements. It also didn't remove tasks after completion, so sometimes I would check ‚úÖ more than once because of forgetfulness, messing with my levels.",1
"Has really helped me track and build habbits. I have used it for a few months now, and I really enjoy the UI, the notifications are humorous (So I don't mind getting them). It's super flexible to input what you want to track and seeing your progress on the calendar is really motivational. having tried several apps like this, this is the one I reccomend.",1
"This habit tracking app is great. If there are certain habits you don't want to do every day, like running for instance, you simply select the days you do want to do it and your 'chain' doesn't get broken. You can set it to send you motivational reminders too. I'm finding it very powerful for getting on top of my habits, both good and bad. Highly recommended and more sophisticated than most other habit tracking apps.",1
"Life Changing!!! I've been using this app for 2 years and it has changed my lifestyle. I actually bought the premium and I didn't regret it at all. I love that it is intuitive, the streak motivates you to keep doing. I love that there are more rewards that comes with the streak. For example, if you reach 30-day marked, you should receive a badge or trophy just to keep us motivated.",1
"The #1 Best Habit Tracking app in my opinion. You can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week. When recording your activities, It shows your average amount of the activities done during the week . This app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient. This app is extremely easy to use and it is free! I honestly wouldnt be able to live without it. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"I purchased the premium version so I can use the home screen widgets. It motivates me to stick to my habbits once I see them all the time when I use my phone. I've been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I woke up early, went to the gym, read at least 20 pages and flossed in the evening EVERYDAY. Obviously, is not all thanks to the app, but it does help to track my progress and keep me accountable if I miss anything. Just start with easy to achieve habbits to make it work long term and build on that.",1
"I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself.",1
"Superb!! Possibly the best app i have ever installed!! There are a lot of things out there that claim to make a differnece, but this one really does. It has helped me develop powerful, life changing habits that i have been meaning to for a long time but struggled to make it stick. seeing the chain of successes builds a resolve to continue that is stronger motivation than I couldve ever expected. Cant recommend this highly enough - especially as there is a free version to get started with!!",1
"It's great so far. I can only set 5 goals on the free version, but to be honest, any more than that and I'd be doomed to fail anyway! love that you can see the chain of days you've achieved your goals - I hate breaking that streak! The charts and graphs down the bottom also offer a nice visualization of your success which I really like too. The ability to set reminders for each habit is also good as it can give you the extra kick you need.",1
"I love how simple this is! It's helped me focus on those important things that I want to accomplish. I just wish there was space for more than 5 free habits!!! This means, if you decide to track something else in that space, then you'll lose the data, unless of course you write it down before changing it. This is why it loses a star, in my opinion. It's the best FREE habit tracker I've found! A lot of other apps have free trials, which I don't even bother with.",1
"well, thanks for the app and the nice touches and effort that've been put in it. However, there are other simple things you can adjust: - adding colors options for every habit - making marking with color scheme and check marks at the same time - making an access on laptop - when I put measurable habit he ask me about the account twice!! Idw what is for? I know you want to keep the app with beautiful simplicity, which is great, but you should offer more options for those who wants more",1
Good app for tracking and changing you habits. I use it to keep score and help me commit to bet behavior,1
This isnt magical app that you'll change habits instantly. It'll require effort from your side. Then this app is worth it.,1
awesome! The tracker is pretty simple to use and has a clean layout. It gets the job done!,1
Great for keep track of any type of habit or behaviour. The app also graphs you success/fail ratio and you can customise the type of habit you choose to suit you needs. Excellent app.,1
"Quite stimulating! I recommend it. Now (OCT 2021), having used it for a couple of years, I still recommend it. It helped me going to sleep in time. It seems so childish: ""If I don't go now I cannot give me the OK and thus break the chain"". Haha, but it works for me... 2024-03-19: Same opinion, using it for other habits.",1
"Near perfect. Considering you only really need a piece of paper on the wall or a calendar to track habits. It does that and more with a clean UI. It also has nice features when you create a habit, download it to see what I mean. Discussion posts are a really nice bonus as well. Overall the app is gold.",1
"Well this app covers everything to which an individual could use to receive personal help. You are able to go as often as you desire and even read how others progress is going and give support. It record progress, you get support from others who are going thru what you are and regain strength when you are weak in what they offer to say. ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",1
I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks. A lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee. I paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment.,1
"The best app for a procrastinator who avoids doing things because they dont want to fail. Each consecutive day is another success, small bites and small goals made this procrastinator write every day for 78 days and read every day for 163! I hadn't done either for years. Small achievable goals help and this app helps you mark them down in a way that feels satisfying. The main goal? Don't break the chain! -note that I'm only using the free version. 8$ seems pricey for the premium benefits-",1
"Elegant design. This app is easy to use and only takes seconds. Unlike other apps that distract you with details, blog posts, etc (I'm looking at you, myfitnesspal), I can easily track my habits in seconds without going down the internet rabbit hole **edited to add that I'm still using it weeks later. Very simple. Although I started off ambitious and added many habits, I ended up following the developers suggestion and paring back to two key habits. I'll add more after these stick",1
"KISS! Easiest way to keep on track is to make tracking simple and encouraging. It's easy to set up. Features allow for various forms of success - yes/no, 5x/week (any days), number per day - and you get to decide. Worth a shot. You might even adopt that new habit!",1
"This app has helped me get back in track. I started out reading my Bible every three days, and ended reading it every single day. If you are struggling with a bad habit, this is the app for you. I have tried many different habit trackers before, but this has been the best thus far. It shows you your progress percentages too, which is a really cool feature. Highly recommended.",1
"I've tested dozens of habit and routine tracking apps. The clean layout, useful widgets, and versatility of this one puts it above the rest. Even without premium, it is highly functional. Furthermore, premium is a one-time purchase rather then a monthly/annual fee, which was a deciding factor for me.",1
"This app is a simple an elegant solution for tracking habits, it offers widgets as well as a nice simple interface for getting habits done. I guess if i had to complain I think i had an issue where if there was a task set to be complete x days a week it would not go away on the widget ever even if you had done the task the required amount of times a week, could have been my mistake however, otherwise great!",1
"To begin with I already loved this app because it's aesthetically pleasing very easy to use and all in all just keeps me in check with the things I want to keep up with in my life, I was having issues with my phone so I had to reset and when I try to log back in I didn't have any of the data and I had purchased premium and I didn't have that anymore and I reached out to the support team and they were able to completely help me and merge my account so that I had all my data again and my premium again with no issue within just a few hours they are amazing and I highly recommend this app!!!",1
"I have been using the free version for about a year. I am enjoying it keeping me accountable and becoming familiar with my patterns. It helps me know where to put my efforts into improving myself. Update, I've been using the free version for several years now. I downloaded a newer version recently since I accidentally deleted the original version. It no longer has my old stats. I was sad. It still does not change my opinion of this app. I love it. Helps keep me accountable.",1
"I purchased this app's premium after 3 days. The slim design makes it easy to navigate and doesn't distract from the goal. I have found myself being better about some of the tasks I out to myself, which I can attribute to this app's ease of use. Even the tasks I have not been able to develop a habit for, I like that I am forced now to decide not to do it. Where before, i would never remember that it needed done.",1
"10/10 Great app! Let's you keep track of goals and habits daily. It's highly customizable and will send you notifications to remind you of stuff, if you want. Also I really like the message boards, I find them really inspirational. Also, I've been using this app for several months, and it's never asked me to pay anything. And there aren't any ads either. I know that there's a premium version in one of the side menus, but I'm not sure what it does because it already gives you everything you want.",1
"It's helped me stay on track with habits I want to cultivate. I'm really data driven and thrive on external validation, so I like seeing graphs and the calendar fill up with my successful days. It works well for me. The app itself is good too. It hasn't crashed or done anything unexpected in the week I've used ii find logging mt. The only thing I wish I could do is go back and change what makes a day successful.",1
"It's done it's job very well for me so far. It prompts me to keep it up to date using notifications and accurately tracks my habits. Be aware that the actual improvement must take place within your mind, the app can't change you. It's job is to track your daily habits and present you with accurate visual data on your progress, it does that job very Well.",1
it is a nice convenient way to help build new habits and keep me on track.,1
Liked the color coded style of tracking. Green for good/success. Light red for bad/failure. What I'll love it's an hour by hour option for each day and then an option to view weekly/monthly with each marked/checked hours of each day showing in the week/month view. A long chain of greens all through. Big mental incentive to keep going on. Solid job. Keep it up!,1
"Really awesome app!!! Its definitely easier than other habit tracking apps I've tried, and better designed too. I get a lot of use out of it, so I purchased the full version. If you're trying to keep track of multiple things at once, especially with the goal of remembering to do things, this will help. I have horrible memory due to health issues so I sometimes forget to do basic things, and this keeps me on track.",1
"Great app for tracking whatever it is that you want to develop as a regular habit. Clean interface and very easy to set up new habits like exercising on set days, not smoking or taking medicine. The 'streaks' length & percentage success are good motivators and give you a nice visual reference for how well you're doing.",1
"Just overall a great app if you want to become more concious about your daily habits. And, of course it's very helpful to create new habits / erase unwanted ones ;-) The paid version is gonna be a necessary upgrade if you want to keep track of lots of things, but it's totally worth it!",1
This app really helps me keep my goals and tasks organized. I used to use sticky notes to plan out my goals but I find that using this app is more convenient because I usually have my phone with me. I can check my goals any time I want as opposed to having to bring sticky notes with me all the time. I highly recommend this app for people starting out on tracking their habits or people who are looking for a non-traditional way of tracking habits.,1
"Easy to use, clean design, perfect! Ok, almost :) I would want my number to show in week view, (instead of the three comment dots). And an option to choose an interval: A number no smaller than___ and no larger than___.""",1
"The best app I've ever used to track habits. Easy to use, great interface, flexible. The way all the circles connect together makes me really motivated to stay consistent. Honestly amazing.",1
"So far. This has been the best habit tracker I've found yet. I loooooovvveeee the customizability. You can set things you have to do a certain amount of times, or can only do so many times. You can add things you want to do just a couple times a week, or every day, it's so nice! The interface is just really simple and easy to use too.",1
"By far the best habit building and tracking app I have used and I have tried many. Have been using the paid version for 6 months or more and my routines ane habits are the best of my life. You need more than an app, but having a tool like this is KEY. LOVE the flexibility, simplicity and the streak-oriented design. Thank you HabitBull!",1
"I have a serious and long standing issue with procrastinating. Started using the app in yet another bid to get me to be productive. So far it's worked a treat. :) I think the streak keeping is a big part of it, for me. It's easy to keep a habit for a few days but the longer it goes on the more expensive it is to slack off, giving you an extra push to work harder.",1
HabitBull is what I was looking for in a habit tracking app. It has a lot of customization for what constitutes a goal streak and a simple overview and data entry screen. I was happy that premium is just a one-time fee. And it's cool to see the posts from other people working on their goals too.,1
"I just cant believe how a simple app like this can change someone's life this much. I'm using this app for bit longer than a week now. I started with 4 habits which I really wanted to integrate in to my life. continuously doing all 4 things without a single drawback throughout entire week. this app is providing an unbelievable encouragement and motivation to achive something you really want. thank you for helping me to change my life. Keep up the good work, and Im keeping up mine.",1
"It's so easy to use and very good in keeping me motivated. I love that it allows me and other users to create a discussion board about our journey. I also like that it shows you your progress and streaks. The colorful design also makes it fun to use. And best of all, it doesn't bother me with ads when i'm using it. I am using the free version and i feel bad that i'm not paying the developer back. I am unable to get the premium version right now but i will surely upgrade when i'm able to.",1
This has allowed me to organize my thoughts and get my life back on track. Theres nothing I hate more than seeing that little red dot indicating a missed or failed day. It really drove me to follow through and get greens across the board kind of like a competition against myself while at the same time building towards my self prescribed goals. Awesome App!,1
"Really simple and intuitive UI. It's really an easy time getting familiar with the app, and it has all the options that you want covered while keeping everything clear, uncomplicated and user friendly. Not to mention the design that stresses your habit chain/streak to fully induce that ever gratifying dopamine release ü§©üòçü§ó",1
With the short period of time I've used this app I have enjoyed it. The app has been a great tool to help my keep track of my 2018 goals and stay on top of new habits I am trying to create to better myself and future. it has a clean UI although i wish it had more theme options. This app has been great at motivation on days o have slacked off or days I messed up with its visual aid on my progress for 2019. I would recommend it to someone trying to create a better habits.,1
"Well, like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be.  BUT, if you are committed to either making or breaking (or both!) any habit you can think of, then this little jewel of an app can help you do that.  The idea of ""streaks"" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way.  When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face.  What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit.  I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up.  The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better.",1
"Very effective app for making or breaking bad habits. I have only had this app for a short period but it has been exactly as promised. A modification that could help would be when you read a post on the discuss board, going back to that post instead of back to the beginning. Overall I would definitely recommend this app",1
"Terrific little app. Have had it for 9 days, and it's already making a difference in my life. I've tried other habit trackers, but often find them bloated with features to the point where I'm spending more time in the app than in getting on with my goals. With this one, I'm in and out in a few moments. Well done, developers!",1
i read somewhere that the only way to know what you are achieving is to track it! i struggled a lot by making my own calendars and marking them ....also not being able to mark my progress when m away from home..! but this app.. its like you have your progress with you all the time... the percentage helps you know how much you are going to keep that resolution you made on 1st January üëç. I am using the basic version right now .. but i Guess i am going to upgrade to the premium version,1
"I have always had problems when it comes to structure in my life. This app was a beautiful addition to my transformation in life, if i ever got slack or forgot to do something, I will make up for it the next day or even do it on the same day. Seeing consistency visually has definitely helped me to maintain structure and positive repetition. Thank you to the creators of this amazing app üòä Goodluck to anyone who has attracted this app ‚úå",1
"My favorite habit tracking app! I am the author of multiple books on how to build better habits, and regularly speak at conferences on how to create behavioral change. This app is my secret tool for keeping myself accountable - and I recommend it to all my clients. Simple and easy to use. The one thing that would make it better would be if it had some ""reminders"" / notifications. Otherwise, it's close to perfect",1
"I downloaded several habit tracking apps earlier this year and settled on one I was using for a few months. Somehow I came across this app, and I knew almost immediately that this was the app I was searching for. If you don't have the discipline, a pop up notification won't change your life, but I find this app much more realistic in tracking habits and their frequency compared to competitors.",1
"Fantastic app, which works just as intended. It reminds me of the habits I'd like to track with funny messages (though you can also be notified by normal messages), is simple and motivating (when you reach milestones, etc). I prefer it to other apps simply as it's just habit tracking and not much else, unlike e.g. Habitica, which is just... too much (for me).",1
"Helps me grow in ADHD. I have such a hard time setting new goals, and staying committed to myself. Really this is the first app that made it clear, you can only have 1 or 2 Habbits that you're changing at a time. Otherwise you'll fail. And I agree. Stick to it, and this app is immensely helpful. Love it!",1
"Such a straightforward and easy to use app. You have the option to complete your tasks everyday, or specific days of the week. And then, you get an accuracy report on how effective you are with that specific task; as well as, generally how you've done for the week/ month. This app gives you a mental boost to accomplish your goals and to keep moving forward.",1
"Love this minimalistic app! I've been ""hunting"" for habit trackers all my life and this being free is just unbelievable. Its just a simple push of a button. However I feel that the theme could use a little extra more work. Overall, best habit tracker out there. I hope the people behind this app will continue on making more updates and resolve the issue with the premium ones crashing.",1
"I have used many habit trackers over the years, but this was the one that most suited me. It's simple and effective, and even the free version is really useful, the only drawback (for the free version) would be that you cannot track more than 5 habits, but I don't want to follow that many habits either way so it was a perfect match for me!",1
"Love this app. Its easy to use, and helps keep me motivated. Even if i miss a day, the streak may stop but the overall % of the habit is shown so ive found i dont lose that motivation to keep going. And the overall % is shown for all habits, so i can aim to keep that up in the high 80% or 90%. Love it. As a Counsellor ill be recommending this to clients too.",1
Inputting your accomplishment/non-accomplishment is really quick and easy- just click or double click on the particular day. Seeing the whole month with the colour indicators for achieved/didnt achieve for each day is helpful as it's easy to gauge how successful you were that month compared to other months. The motivating messages when you accomplish your goal consistently for a period is a really nice touch!,1
"I like how straightforward this app is. It's easy to use, very visual, and I like that you can set a habit up to need certain days of the month, not every single day. That way you can continue your streak across many days if your goal is only to do it four times a month. It's also really nice to see the percentage in the top right corner of how much you've met your goals. So it'll tell you in percentage how often you're meeting your goal.",1
"i found that, if i am reloading the app from recent apps it is again asking for the password. quit a nice feature . even some important apps are not having this feature. but say if i am switching to another app while seeing some habit chart. when i see in recent apps, i can clearly see the last viewed chart. it would be nice, if u guys can fix this issue",1
"Simple, easy. Love that there are no bells and whistles, just the basic tracker. Love that each goal is customizable, perfect app for someone looking to check boxes on a calendar rather than fill out a diary entry",1
"I'm confused as to why the app is called Habit Tracker in the play store, but when I download and run it on my phone it's called Habit Bull. Other than that, it's great. Simple, easy design. Good aesthetics. I actually like the notifications; I've tried other habit building apps and the notifications are usually intolerable for me. I like this app a lot and I'm happy I found it.",1
"I use it for keeping track of tasks after I complete them. I don't want a reminder of a task,I just need to keep track of it. This app allows me to disable reminders. Keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day. It has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks. The user experience is really easy. You can create multiple tasks (or habits to be), schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page. It shows you stats etc to see your progress. Those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress (i.e. workout reminders), this app is better than calendar scheduling.",1
Very helpful to be mindful of areas you want to change and feels rewarding as you see streaks of success. It is easy to use. It's design allows you to take baby steps towards more ambitious goals. Also setup manages your goals so they are realistically obtainable. Reminders setup is very flexible so notifications are useful and welcome. Great user friendly design which is highly customizable,1
"Very useful app, but with free version you get only five slots for your habbits",1
"Easy to use, so that tracking doesn't become one more thing on the to do list. It is quick!",1
It was really good app and it is but the trouble is now we can't refresh thought images etc. And aslo there is no discussion,1
"It's very nice application, helps to get out bad habits, reminders do help..",1
"The main reason I chose the premium version of this app is being able to easily upload media with your journal entry. Great to document hikes in my case. I've been having issues with their Coach feature and have reached out to them twice. Concerning being able to join 2 different programs for AM & PM journaling for instance. And not having the Coach prompts appear in their web version, only on mobile. Beyond the Coach feature, it has been great for me. Pretty simple to use.",1
Good app with lots of options.,1
"Love it. Simple. Yes/no answers asking if i did the thing. I can also include how many prompts i want, so if i missed it earlier, the app will remind me later that day again. Like ""hey, go do the thing"". I also appreciate how the calendar looks to show me which days i did the thing or DIDN'T do the thing if I'm trying to break a habit.",1
Just what I was looking for great app,1
Pretty good for tracking habits,1
"Its awesome to make a new habit Super, Currently I'm using this for many purposes. It's so useful",1
It's a nice app . Definately do try it,1
Lovely simple app,1
"Not able to login, otherwise this app is awesome",1
Easy to use but sometimes it doesn't send my notification reminder even though I have it set to 7 days a week.,1
This App ised to work well on my previous phone. But it doesn't on One Plus 6T. It didn't sync my account. And then it doesn't even send notifications.,1
"Good. But please check this app using Samsung s20 seems I have the app issues that it crashes a lot, hasn't affected me yet but thought you might need to know",1
"Simple , and helpful... thank u ‚ô°",1
Easy to track multiple habits,1
Using this to track exercise and it's great to ensure I do some at least once a week and others 3 times,1
Good,1
I should have given it 5 stars but i have to keep one for my self incase i need a star!,1
Simplistic and to the point :),1
Good one to keep track of actions and goals over period of time..If there is a way to sum up values provided in each goal it would be even more better,1
Easy simple and engaging,1
"I found this useful to help me incorporate an exercise regime, however can only record 5 habits without paying.",1
Simple. 5 goals with free version. Great for a busy person with an analytical personality or someone who likes a visual.,1
Nice and convenient app but I like to edit my review after 4+ year This app is good but not fully free... If you want to create habit more than 5 then you've to purchase their subscribtion otherwise you don't have more room to make more than that I request to developers Make it free for high school student and college student Thank you for making this app. Plz do look into this and take action asap,1
It's very organized how you can see monthly and weekly. But I'm not sure if I set up the reminders correctly because I'm not getting notifications.,1
Good app,1
The app syncs data across multiple devices which has been handy and the premium cost is relatively inexpensive. The only major disadvantage is a lack of a checklist feature for habits.,1
It would be great to also have an optional to do list.,1
Easy to use. Adaptable for a variety of things to track.,1
App doesn't give reminder though it is set on the app. Please improve and fix the bug,1
"I have not paid for the full version, but I love how I can have 5 different goals and I can set very specific reminders/notifications throughout the day for each one. It has helped me not only to remember my goal, but also to track how good I am at actually achieving consistency in each goal. I've learned about my habit patterns from using this app. This is a great app for me!",1
"Excellent app. Simple but extremely useful, has absolutely improved my life and held me accountable to keeping my habits--this app is the reason I was able to learn a foreign language, start reading consistently again, and cut social media out of my life. Something about it just works. Additionally, the free version is usable and doesn't overwhelm you with ads, a rare find these days. Definitely get this app if you are looking to change something in your life!",1
"This app has been great for me, especially to track daily goals I set for myself. it shows me the days I have succeeded, and the days Ive fallen short. I can see a history of my success and setup reminders to make sure I don't miss a daily goal. I've been using the app for a little over a month now and highly recommend it to anyone who has daily goals they want to rack and be successful with!",1
"I didn't think this app was much at first, but I soon started to get into the swing of things I've been trying to get myself into for the longest time after installing. There's just something about that feeling of satisfaction when you fill in a circle for completing something. It tracks your streaks and your average progress. It also encourages you with cute quotes about being yourself and being the best you! Forming (or breaking) a habit can be done easily with Habit Bull!",1
"I've only had this a week and so far I love it!! Easy to use, nice visually, and I really appreciate that you can set what days of the week the goal can be accomplished and that you can choose how the goal will be reached (y/n, certain number, etc). You only get 5 goals with the free version and no back-up on the cloud but for now that works for me. There is a way to reorder your goals (when looking at them on the menu bar under My Order, press and hold goal, then drag), or you can see by score",1
"I use this app to track various symptoms of my IBS. I also tried HabitHub and Loop, but only this app allowed me to track on a daily basis how many times a certain symptom occurred, and also set ""goals"" based on either ""no more than"" and ""no fewer than"" a given number of occurrences. I preferred the interface and graphs (I'd like to see a chart of raw numbers instead of just pass/fail) in some of the other apps, but from a purely functional standpoint this is the one to beat.",1
I downloaded a bunch of habit-tracking apps to test them out before New Year's. Habitbull seemed the most intuitive and straightforward. I really like the design (shows the streak on the calendar) and the fact that it nudges you if you don't check in during the day. There's even a community function where you can share the struggle with others doing the same thing. Great app.,1
"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!",1
"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend.",1
"Easy to set up and daily tracking is very simple. Visual display is great. If a habit is set for every other day, or with some other gap in between, the app shows a chain with open circles rather than solidly-colored circles. Likewise, if the goal is a specific number of minutes or repetitions, it color-codes the entry differently depending on whether you met or did fewer reps than the goal. Only using the free app for now but plan to upgrade.",1
"This app is perfect for tracking my habits. It allows an effective level of depth without being overwhelming. I have been using this for several months and I love it. The only thing I would like to see would be ""Milestones"" to increase/decrease a habit without retroactively turning past week successes into failures. For example, increasing a workout habit from 2x/wk to 3x/wk.",1
"Outstanding habit tracker app that is highly configurable to track daily, weekly, or any frequency of habits needed. Simple and clean user interface. Only thing I would change is adding the ability to change the order of habits. Right now, the habits appear on the screen in the order you entered them, and there does not appear to be a way to change the order",1
"HabitBull, also known as Habit Tracker, is a standout app for those aiming to develop new habits or break old ones. It offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies tracking daily habits and progress. With customizable reminders, it ensures you stay on track. The motivational quotes and vibrant community provide additional support and inspiration. Its analytics feature, which gives detailed insights into your behavior patterns, is particularly helpful for understanding and overcoming challen",1
"Excellent app for tracking your good/bad habits, the ""dont break the chain"" motivation technique is surprisingly effective at keeping you on point. UI/UX is simple/intuitive enough and gets the job done. One caveat is that there is no website, program, or windows app version that is available on a PC unless you use a clunky android emulator. It would be greatly appreciated to add this functionality for those of us who prefer doing most if not all our work/productivity related tasks at a computer rather than a smartphone. Adding this feature would change my 4 star rating to a 5.",1
"Very good for starting small. I remember downloading a similar app without a limit and I was very quickly overwhelmed by the number of goals I set for myself. I like only being able to track 5, it motivates me to reach those goals as soon as I can so I can set and work towards setting more. I also love the motivational quotes under the ""All Habits"" section.",1
Usefull but need more improvement in appearance,1
Great app!,1
This app is just a saviour. Trust me you will love it,1
Fairly effective tool to track habits and consistency.,1
Its good that a app like this exist thank you for creating it,1
"Would be better if the option to keep more than 5 habits, without the paid version would be provided.",1
I like the app and its cool. Easy to use and fluid.,1
I am very happy with the app! It has helped me to track habbits! Feedback: I would like to be able to see my progress in a bar like monthly or yearly.,1
Really good app! But i hope the charts of data analysis would be more detailed about the dates and scores,1
Overall but bad. Serves its purpose. However the motivation box is blank and you thumbs up/down/share doesn't work. Box is empty.,1
Pretty useful app. thanks,1
This one is actually working for me with the widgets. I say give it a chance and pay for a month.,1
Great app but can only put a limited number of habits in the free version,1
Great,1
Stared using this app recently. I would like more notifactions and reminders to do my daily good habits. Other then that its a pretty good app üëç,1
Easy to use this app.,1
"I'm not the kind of person who can stay loyal to an app regarding productivity for over a few days. But I've been using this app for over 2 months. And I love it! It's great to track habits. You can customize your habits and even add daily notes. Once you're on a streak, it feels harder and bad to break the streak. This is great!",1
I've developed my own habit formation program on Excel. The key is whatever motivates. It's amazing how certain things can do that. I believe this app has that potential. Easy to use once you figure it out. Would be nice if you could copy reminders to other days.,1
"Love the app, but I'd love to be able to set a success criteria in terms of number of ok misses. For example I'd like to set a goal that says I keep my habit everyday, but ok to miss once or twice a month. Currently I can only set a goal of 28 per month which isn't as helpful.",1
Muito bom,1
Easily tracks progress and encourages on achievements!,1
Best of class if you like features. I've used it for years.,1
easy to use and track habits,1
"The app works well on keeping track of several objectives that imply a day count. The interface is poor and could be improved, contact me if you need help with designing a better interface. I recommend this app!",1
It is the best app for me,1
Good,1
"Simple, but amazing.",1
It has surely helped me,1
Change my life good for me,1
Nice app,1
It's a good way to keep track of my fitness and other goals. I have a habit for: How many ounces of water I drink per day. How many push-ups / squats I do per day. How many minutes of meditation I do per day. How many minutes I bike / run per day. If I left weights 3 times per week. How many minutes I focus on my mental health. How many minutes I practice programming. How many minutes I spend improving my typing speed. How many pages I write per day. How many drawings / pixel Art I complete.,1
was a Great app for tracking something you are working and best of all had functional widgets. seems like it got bought and ignored though. deleted it,1
Very useful app!,1
Very nice app to make habit,1
It is awesome. They give the best features,1
This app doesn't seem to send push notification habit reminders anymore for me no matter what I do. Really makes me not use the app anymore unfortunately. Any solutions?,1
Just started but I think the premise is ingenious!,1
"Easy to navigate Simple and organized No fuss, just the way i like it üôÇüëç",1
Great app for tracking exercise routines. Love it!,1
It's really helpful program to do routine ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
I love this app and it has helped me make some serious gains in my daily productivity / life goals. I've been using it for about a year and have recommended it to others.,1
"Simple, useful.",1
Best habit app,1
It's pretty good and has a useful streak widget!,1
"This is a very amazing application, I searched a lot on Play Store and then found a good app, thanks a lot to the company that made this app.",1
Awesome and useful.,1
Helpful application.,1
Never thought that doing such a simple thing can help me to stay on track. This app is amazing and really helps.,1
I have ADHD and this app helps me keep my day on task,1
I've been using this app for a while now. I like being able to check off my goals and see the progress and the number of days I've kept it up. Very satisfying!,1
Nice app tho,1
Great at keeping me accountable for my drinking and helping me be mindful and feel I have control.,1
"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!",1
"This app is almost everything I want. I just wish there was more of an RPG element. I played Habitica and it didn't quite scratch that itch either. Maybe something like small quests that utilize text and dice-rolls that can be improved based on your level in different categories. I'd enjoy the hell out of that, and would happily pay for expansions, additional quests/stories, etc.",1
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",1
"Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars? It's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again.",1
"I think this is a great app especially for those with ADHD. However there are some slight improvements I think could be made. 1. I would like to be able to change the times that a task can be done more easily, just because I'm only up during the night. 2. I wish I could change how much XP and Gold I lose for failing a task separately. 3. It would be nice to be able to set up a custom default setting for task. But besides those few things I do really love the app.",1
"Excellent customization, calendar could use a little love. Loved the app for giving me that extra motivation to build good habits! I'd love to see a little more in terms of organization options. Currently the app puts your tasks in order of time due, then alphabetically, with no option to sort them differently. I'd like to be able to separate my daily tasks from other tasks, so they don't clog up my list and my calendar view. The ability to hide dailies from the calendar view would be great!",1
"Fantastic app, I am so relieved to have finally found an app that actually helps to remind me what I need to do as often and as many times as I need while also keeping track of how well I am progressing, I especially like how it has a widget so I don't necessarily have to open the app to complete a task (liable to get distracted otherwise). Yet, I think it would be even cooler if you guys added on a goal organizer or something, even if only on the side. Then it would be absolutely perfect üíØüí•",1
"Fantastic app, practically flawless in practicality and design, once you get the hang of it. It has helped me establish and maintain habits and goals. It's like I'm hacking my brain with a reward system too. I get to track how my accomplished tasks influence my skills and characteristics. Only con being that the tasks duplicate after I check it off. Sometimes 2 or 3 times. I end up having to 'skip' the duplicate ones. Please fix it's seems to only be getting worse.",1
"Personally, taking the time to translate my every task into RPG format is tedious. Pretty time consuming in terms of customization. It's more like an RPG Maker, but to-do style. It's not what I'm looking for but given the developers perspective it's excellent for what it's worth. Flexible, extremely customizable and full of possibilities. Suggestion: allowing to download other users formats they've already taken the time to create.",1
"PRO: I *love* the fact that it provides a framework for first deciding WHO you want to be (characteristics), then HOW to get there (skills & habits). CONS: - To use the app in that way is not intuitive, and there is a long learning curve to get there. - Ads are obtrusive. The inclusion of audio limits where I can use the app, which makes it less useful. - User guide is not always clear enough. - Reward system needs more robust explanation. - A few more free icons would be nice.",1
"I love the app specifically for the skills component. It allows me to actually quantify the intrinsic reward of completing each task, so it doesn't feel like I'm just checking off a to-do list. I really wish it was more visually appealing like some of its competitor apps. The interface is a little dated visually and feels a bit rigid; however the options for color themes and task icons somewhat makes up for it.",1
"A very good rip-off of LifeRPG‚Äîtaking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly. Seems to be monetizing the idea though, putting in ads and lots of in-app purchases and requiring a RECURRING payment subscription rather than one-time purchase to unlock features",1
"I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.",1
"app has improved a lot since initial launch and it's still my go-to for my daily tasks! still hoping for more social features in the future. also, there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use, i think it's still related to the amount of tasks i have (i have a very busy schedule), and it causes my phone to overheat. keep up the good work!",1
Almost in my 5th year. No app. problems at all,1
"Does what it says on the tin, and doesn't shove premium in your face. (Premium is worth it, in my opinion.) All I wish it had was a way to group skills separately from characteristics; after a certain number of them, they become quite difficult to view in the graph, and searching through the list would be greatly eased by foldable groups.",1
"I love this app, I struggle with daily habits and this app has so many options for tracking them. I love that you can track a habit for the week. For example writing in my journal twice a week, or stretching 4 times a week.",1
Simple & easy.,1
"Rachel zewdubvcvvcccbnbvbnm,llll",1
Very good app,1
Well laid out and super motivating. 10/10 would recommend.,1
Lost my in app purchase. Can't sign in again. App crashes.,1
really helpful!,1
"Beautiful, simple, encouraging. Way to set up, easy to use. Easy to edit if you miss TRACKING a day (but didn't miss DOING the day üòâ). Love, love, love! Highly recommend!",1
"Love this minimalistic app! I've been ""hunting"" for habit trackers all my life and this being free is just unbelievable. Its just a simple push of a button. However I feel that the theme could use a little extra more work. Overall, best habit tracker out there. I hope the people behind this app will continue on making more updates and resolve the issue with the premium ones crashing.",1
Great app!,1
Very Good App,1
"Easy to use, easy to keep track of.",1
"Dear Developers, When syncing will be fixed? Thanks",1
It is a simple and typically app for observing hapit. I like it üòÄ,1
Very good. Works well with what it does and doesn't try to be everything. I like it.,1
Very good app,1
Would you mind saying yes because this is wonderful software My habits are always good I must say good habits are the best to keep and this app is worth keeping if you want to keep an app and do good habits this is the this is the app to keep I must say it is beautiful beautiful and it tracks everything you need write down to the perfect detail I must say congratulations you guys are excellent developers this is a wonderful application I will keep it for the lifetime if I have it thank you üíñ,1
Excellent app and very helpful,1
Perfect,1
"Nice app, also supports Russian language, unfortunately no Russian style calendar",1
Awesome app!,1
Good application,1
This isnt magical app that you'll change habits instantly. It'll require effort from your side. Then this app is worth it.,1
Easy to use,1
awesome! The tracker is pretty simple to use and has a clean layout. It gets the job done!,1
"Quite stimulating! I recommend it. Now (OCT 2021), having used it for a couple of years, I still recommend it. It helped me going to sleep in time. It seems so childish: ""If I don't go now I cannot give me the OK and thus break the chain"". Haha, but it works for me... 2024-03-19: Same opinion, using it for other habits.",1
it is a nice convenient way to help build new habits and keep me on track.,1
Great for keep track of any type of habit or behaviour. The app also graphs you success/fail ratio and you can customise the type of habit you choose to suit you needs. Excellent app.,1
"HabitBull, also known as Habit Tracker, is a standout app for those aiming to develop new habits or break old ones.

Good app for tracking and changing you habits. I use it to keep score and help me commit to bet behavior,1
It's simple & efficient. I love it.,1
Really good app,1
Helps a lot to track my goals,1
"This app is fantastic; one of my favorites. i bought the full version and it helps me a lot. Clean interface, easy to use, helps me track progress in multiple areas. I have used multiple habit trackers in the past but this is by far the best!",1
The interface is very beginner friendly and the tutorial shows you how everything works. You can share your streaks with others to inspire and motivate them. It even reminds you everyday to use the app just in case you forgot to use it. This app is the best for quitting addictions.,1
This is a brilliant app for tracking habits. You only need to use the free version to begin with until you embed enough habits to pay and the paid app seems reasonable. I would like it if the numbered habits showed the number on the circles instead of having to click into it to see it. Other than that I love the app.,1
"Excellent app, excellent widgets. I use this with widget as my daily habit manager. Could do with an update and could have other features but what it does (help maintain habit streaks) it does better than any other app I've found. I bought premium one off to use the apps.its worth it for me. Don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it. Free to use though, only widgets are premium",1
"Easy to set up and track so i dont feel I'm wasting my time trying to track simple things. Other goal/habit tracking apps make it a bit of a chore to record, but Ive found i can do this quickly whenever i think of it. Highly recommend if you want a simple view of how you are doing.",1
"This app really helps me stay mindful of my daily goals. Being able to visualize my progress helps me to decide where to put more focus and what to prioritize each day. It's highly motivating for me personally to be able to tick off the goals I've met, and creates a great sense of satisfaction when I've achieved them. I highly recommend this app to anyone who could use a little help staying on top of daily tasks and accomplishing daily or weekly goals.",1
Very helpful. Simple and effective app design. Support from others and discussion helps a lot to form a habit as well as get rid of bad ones. Password lock ensures safety. the developers have definitely put lots of work into this app. Free version and premium works great. I ordered premium and it's worth the money.,1
"The things that is different with app is that you get a notification with the specific habit and you can say you did it from the notifications bar so you don't need to open the app every time. It's really fast and efficient, which makes me more productive as well.",1
"Great simple Interface. Perfect for tracking a habit, good or bad. I use it to track my push/pull/leg days in the gym. Have been using it for the past 3 (+/-?) years and have yet to find an app that even comes close to this one in terms of ease of use.",1
"Super awesome! I have a tendency to run away and stop using any app or anything else that makes me feel bad when it notices I haven't done whatever it is at all, even for a few days. This just gives me a ""you can do it, let's keep going"" rather than, ""you haven't done x for 3 days in a row"". Although I know the 2nd messages is not meant to make me feel bad, it does. I love this app!",1
"The best! I tried 10 habit trackers. Wish it had Edge screen implemented like Habitsooz tracker (it's an app but also has Edge Screen so you can view all habits & check/uncheck them off quickly rather than having to leave current screen, find the app, open it & search for habits. It's there on my screen at all times, just gotta swipe the edge screen handle to see). Edge Screen is on Samsung phones, I'm sure all devs kno it. I can send u screenshots what Habitsooz edge screen looks like jst ask",1
"Helped me make a streak! I am a person who starts an activity with excitement but loses interest eventually, most likely before a week. But this app made me continue because i had to punch everyday. When i crossed 4 days it felt like I should not let it go to waste,let me continue. And then activity like drinking 3L of water everyday was easy to achieve. So when i made a one-week streak of that, the app congratulated me and built more excitement. Rest is history! üíõ",1
"Simple, no B.S. habit tracking. Forming a habit is hard, and it makes sense to track your progress for multiple reasons. Some apps and methods are almost as hard to use as the habit you are trying to create is to make. Not HabitBull. I've only been using the app for about a week now and it has been painlessly helping me work towards my goals and forge a better self.",1
"Amazing app! I love how if you are tracking something in quantity you can enter in and track different quantities for each day. The positive vibes from the texts and reminders make it fun and helps keep me relaxed when I'm really stretching for a goal. In addition, it counts the number of days I have been consistent unlike other apps I have tried. Sure do appreciate everything Habit Bull provides! Thank you for the work and thought put into this!",1
"Simple intuitive interface, convenient options to set your habits, marking daily goals is easy too. I tried a bunch of these apps, and usually they are either too complicated, or not having enough flexibility. But this one is just right",1
"I like how habits can be customized and how the habits are connected together by days. It's a thoughtful design. It's so simple to press a dot for a completed habit - perfectly easy to record. After one week, I'm accomplishing more than I expected using the simple tools from this app.",1
"Hi, very good app. just It has only one chart for characteristics. which also shows for the period of one day. Please add more charts with monthly and weekly timeframes for characteristics. This makes the program much more attractive. In this case, the program will be complete and without defects. üî•üî•üî• I am waiting for the new version üî•üî•üî•",1
"Very encouraging! This app keeps me motivated, when I feel like giving up.",1
Very good app,1
"Easy to use, clean design, perfect! Ok, almost :) I would want my number to show in week view, (instead of the three comment dots). And an option to choose an interval: A number no smaller than___ and no larger than___.""",1
Nice app,1
Easy and flexible. Helps me keep myself accountable.,1
Really easy to use and super helpful,1
Very helpful,1
Easy to use and very handy,1

A big thank you guys. I really appreciate your labours. Just super,1
"i use this app for years, fixed many habits!",1

great,1
"Simple and effective, great app for tracking habits",1
"Very very nice experience with this app I love this app so much bcz it manage my time , study and professional work and I can't say in words that this app is so helpful also it motivates me and I use it for daily basis wish I knew this app before but thank you very much :) .",1
good i like,1
Best,1
It is easy and doesn't require a lot of details. I like the yes/no option.,1
First gave 5stars in 2017 and still going strong. Love this app and so much for free. Thanks for keeping me on an even keel!,1
"The best app I've ever used to track habits. Easy to use, great interface, flexible. The way all the circles connect together makes me really motivated to stay consistent. Honestly amazing.",1
"Helps me grow in ADHD. I have such a hard time setting new goals, and staying committed to myself. Really this is the first app that made it clear, you can only have 1 or 2 Habbits that you're changing at a time. Otherwise you'll fail. And I agree. Stick to it, and this app is immensely helpful. Love it!",1
"Simple, easy, straightforward, helps your crush it, turn habits into disciplines",1
Great app!! Monitoring my new habits and starting the new year right üí™,1
"Simple, easy. Love that there are no bells and whistles, just the basic tracker. Love that each goal is customizable, perfect app for someone looking to check boxes on a calendar rather than fill out a diary entry",1
No BS. This app is very customizable and just does that it says on the tin - tracks habits. No invasive ads.,1
That's awesome. I've chosen 2 or 3 habits to keep (eg training and bible reading) for six months at least. And it's working fine! Haven't miss a day.,1
"Simple layout, no unneeded notifications",1
"Helpful for me remembering things i need to do, build & stick to a routine.",1
Bought the premium version right away as its just what I was after. Great app. Would it be possible to have the flexibility to start your week on whatever day you choose (rather than only Sunday or Monday).,1
"I'm gonna sound like an advertisement from how much i love this app. It DOES ITS JOB in the sense that it makes productivity a game. I have ADHD and this makes impossible tasks fun, the rewards feature helps the most. I also love the fact that it doesn't try to look clean and polished and ~aesthetic~, rather it feels more natural in its layout. The only downside is that it takes a while to get used to how the different features work, but that's only minor. Love this app immensely.",1
"This is a great, powerful and wonderful app. The ability to make a task subtask of multiple parents is wonderful and unique. It allows for specifying a task as predecessor for multiple tasks. The skills and characteristics stats allows us to instantly find out which areas we are yet to focus more on and immensely helps in planning. First of all ability to have infinite levels of subtasks itself is a great feature.",1
"I had another app similar to this, and chose this one because of the additional skills function that levels up our attributes. It feels more in depth and immersive having these options. The only thing that could make this app better is custom theme colors that I can pick myself. It'd also be preferable if the lifetime access price was around $10-20 instead of $30+ that it currently is.",1
"Amazing!!! That's all I can say about this app. A stylish, modern and beautiful design and easy to use 10/10 UI & UX. I have a suggestion that a section should be considered as a reward, so when a person achieves any goal or reaches a certain number of goals, the reward is displayed and they reward themselves. I hope your wonderful team will be more successful.",1
"This is an incredible app and it really helps you stay on top of tasks and mostly habits but the one thinking that I hate about this app is that you can't change the alarm tone on your tasks and habits, I tried all I can to change them but it just doesn't seem to happen, having a dedicated alarm tone for a particular task is very useful or at least to have a different tone than the default Adio, this is something small in an otherwise perfect app, I'd just love this to be there.",1
"Love it! It's been helping me keep track of my habits, and when setting new ones, putting an alarm as a reminder is great! I say that because even when you silence your notifications, the alarms still go off with sound so no matter what you do to try and blow it off, it makes you focus and keep at it. It won't let you quit. It's something I struggle to do. I set things up to better myself but I always end up quitting half way through, and this app won't let me.",1
I've tried tons of different habit tracking apps and this one is by far my favorite. The different ways to track a habit provides in depth stats to see progress. Categories are a gamechanger and keep everything organized. I love that there's an option to add in tasks and the pomodoro timer is handy to stay focused. Few things I'd love to see added are tags or subcategories for further sorting and a way to group habits together to build routines across different categories. Love the design!,1
I've had it for a few months and I've enjoyed it. The notifications aren't annoying and they're actually good for reminding me to do my tasks and habits. And when I don't use it for a while it doesn't keep sending me notifications which is what I appreciated the most. Some apps just keep sending and it's gets annoying. It just starts back up when you start using the app again.,1
"Super clean, customizable, easy to use scheduling app. You can make it super simple or go in depth with pie charts and bar graphs. I love it, and its helping me start new habits. I love recording things but always give up because it takes too much effort long term. But the scheduled notifications remind me to log daily before I forget! No complaints from me, I highly recommend giving it a try.",1
"Absolutely awesome app. I paid the one time fee for premium within 30 minutes of downloading it. Habit tracker, tasks, and recurring tasks. Lots of customization. I have one small wish but I doubt they see these comments due to volume and it isn't enough to dock it any stars. (They have options on how to order your day. They offer a primary and secondary but I wish I could choose a third so I can order them by time, then priority, then category.)",1
"It's my 1st week using the app but love it so far! Don't see that changing. It's well organized, and I love the calendar option. Definitely a good app to help you stay on schedule and remind you of new habits you're try to create to better yourself. If you're trying to better yourself, or get organized this is a great free app to start with. Thanks guys. Might check out the paid version later. We'll see.",1
"Excellent and elegant app for tracking habits. It offers flexibility without being overly complicated. I tried a couple before this app, and once I used it for a day I upgraded to pro to unlock unlimited habits. Well worth the price. One feature request: it would be great for habits that are ""X per Y"", like "" 3 times per week"", to have an option to keep showing up after completion to tack overachieving (think run 3 times a week, but sometimes I run 4 or 5 times) Great app, thanks!",1
"So far so good. Just started using this app about a week ago. It's working well and is pretty clear cut as to adding or editing the habits. I like the option for reminders. If it continues to work well in the next few weeks, am thinking of buying premium at discounted "" launch"" price of $4.99 . That describes widgets as an extra and I am just wondering what that means.",1
"I've only been using the app for a few days but I'm really loving the accountability it gives me. Creating and tracking progress is very intuitive. Love the flexibility of being able to create habits and tasks with varying frequency and being able to choose how to track (yes/no, checklist, time measurement, etc.) is really helpful. I believe some of these features are accessible only with the paid version but the nominal fee for the premium version is well worth it.",1
"Excellent app that's easy to use and love that they don't have ads all over the place even on the free version. It actually makes me want to pay for the premium all the more. Edit 3/2/22: Not only a great app, but amazing customer service too! I switched phones and ran into an issue with transferring my premium license. This was completely my own fault and they were responsive and provided a complimentary premium membership on my new phone.",1
"I'm really enjoying this app, but I wish it had the following: more view, color, and size options, analytics on all habits done in the course of a week or month, and better widgets. The text is so small in the widget and the texts for the habits in the app doesn't stand out. Oh and setting rewards for completing habits would be really cool. A ""Rewards Earned"" section that you check off once you use the reward (like buy yourself an ice cream).",1
"Very aesthetically pleasing app, which matters to me a lot in a tracker - I want to enjoy looking at it!)) Excellent categorization and customization as well, very effective. Calendar view as well as statistics make it quite obvious how the process is going, as well as when and where it needs adjusting. Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to track their progress in anything, to see the real picture of their organization and actions, and who also care for an aesthetically enjoyable app.",1
"Best, most versatile free version habit tracker I've tried. I love the whole thing. Update: the free version is absolutely great as a basic habit tracker. After over a year I still loved it so much that I bought the paid version, because there were a few features I thought would really enhance my habit tracking on the paid one (i.e. more habits and checklists within habits, which are a game changer). Even if I didn't want those features I would've paid just to support a truly fantastic app.",1
"First day and it's SO easy/great to use. Small wish would be able to use a more user friendly calendar options to see future tasks/goals regularly w/o having to go into each day. Would love to use the app as my full time planner/calendar, it's really that good. Other than that very well organized/simple/easy to use! Love the many features/options/symbols. Highly recommend to anyone starting the new year/wanting more structure and organization or want to main better habits their lifes! Cheap too!",1
"Amazing app! I like to procasinste a lot, and this really helped! Now my life isn't as stressful because of last minute projects, personal hygiene, etc. Other apps were good as well, but the alarm feature really just knocked me out of watching random cat videos for 5 hours straight, and actually doing something! Only complaint is that dark mode should be free, and free users should be able to have 10 free habits, but it is all but mild inconveniences. I'm going to buy premium soon, keep it up!",1
"Habit now is really helping me get into a routine to drink water, take medication, reminder to call people, I even use it to record my weight & blood pressure measurements and see my results on a chart! It would be great if the reminder alarm could display the reason for the alarm much bigger. I have to stop and find my glasses so I can read what it is telling me before I can turn off the alarm. I have made all tasks & habits in caps to help with this, but it's still hard to see sometimes.",1
"Very easy app to use. I also use a hardcopy calendar. This app saves me from having to transfer tasks to next day automatically until completed. I would love to view just the tasks or just the habits in addition to current view. I just got this app & liked it so much that I bought it. It helps me ""chunk down"" my tasks so they don't overwhelm me. Also loves that it includes habits. A nice combo. I love the way it looks. Great job!",1
"Really really great! I only have a few suggestions. 1) Add the option to show 'Habits' page on app open instead of 'Today' page. 2) Swiping gestures to move between the 'Today' & 'Habits' page. And swiping gestures to move between 'Calendar' & 'Statistics'. 3) The ability to add tabs or sub-pages to the habits page. Meaning you could declutter habits if you have a lot. For example you can have a ""Work"", ""School"", ""Fun"", etc tabs that you can setup to move specific habits to. 4) Yearly heatmaps.",1
"The Premium version is SO worth it. I have ADHD and could never figure out how to remember to do all the things that need doing, or even usually that they needed to be done. Stuff like changing the air filter, giving monthly pet meds, paying yearly fees, weekly trash days. I can track them all with this app! Even better, it's helping me build great habits that are SO hard to build- I start and forget. Now I start and the app remembers for me!",1
"I really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. It's the only habit tracker I find myself using and looking forward to utilizing. Great features and interface. It has everything I expect from an app of its kind to help keep me accountable. Also, the app is well maintained with timely updates and improvements. SideNote: The Developer made good on adding that frequencies change feature. Thanks Developers. .üëçüèº",1
"EDIT: Updated to 5 stars thanks to excellent and timely response from developer. Thank you! What immediately attracted me to the app was the lovely design. It does what it says well, although I think it can be better in three ways: (1) edit: issue resolved by developer, thank you! (2) Give an option to skip the evaluate progress screen/settings. Most times I don't want to evaluate my tasks. (3) Allow the widget's text or opacity to be customized.",1
"New user but love it so far, upgraded to premium for lots of great features. Straightforward minimalistic interface with lots of customization options, great for daily habit/task tracking. Nice to have lots of checkable lists and reminders. Weekly view/repeating tasks without specific days assigned, and a way to track sporadic/variable progress on entries without them appearing on the daily ""to do"" would make it perfect for me, maybe I just haven't figured out all the nuances yet. Do recommend!",1
"I love this, definitely worth the purchase. I tried the free version for awhile, but the free version had limitations. I am not one to purchase apps, but I needed a personal assistant and this one is the way to go!! I love it sends reminders to my fitbit. I can pick certain days for reminders; ie: Monday trash and recycling. Thursday and Sunday I can set up my plan for my days off. Etc. I can make new habits or tasks. And now won't loose my lists, which uses to have lists lol",1
"This app has helped me be more mindful and consistent in how I spend my day, and in what I want to accomplish. I recently switched phones and had an issue with the backup, support didn't take longer than 24 hrs to respond...it was a weekend so that's fair. Definitely pleased with how I can keep track of things, whether by checkbox, list, number of times during the week etc. From daily bible reading, to house cleaning, this app is IT. It would be nice to share tasks but not a deal breaker. GET IT",1
"This is replacing a somewhat simpler habit tracker that I've been using for a couple years. The UI is intuitive and easy to set up and has a lot of options for habit frequency and targets. I like that you can set a full time period, including the start date, for the habit. My old tracker just had a target end date. Glad the option to sort the habits manually is coming (or at least that is alluded to on several previous responses to reviews). That would be a good improvement to the UI. I do wish there were a way to synch data across devices, however. The cloud backup option may work for that, but I think it could be simplified using the linked account data. There is also not a ""sync on start up/close"" or ""daily"" option for that, so I'd regularly be getting stale data on the second device upon upload of the backup.",1
"I've used a few habit-tracking apps, but switched to HabitNow a few years ago, and it is definitely the best i've seen. The UI is very well thought-out -- highly configurable, but not complicated to use. Getting a friendly chime as a cue is a crucial aspect, without being disruptive. I paid for the full app almost immediately -- always vote ""yes"" to excellent implementation and fair business practices.",1
Best Routine and Calendar app by far!!! I love that I can use it for bothh reoccurring routines and for my one time calendar tasks. I have been using my default samsung calendar and scavenging for a new app and for a while I found a routine app but it bugged the hell out of me and it wouldn't do normal calendar functionality until I found thiss. I now have everything on here that I need. 10/10 and can't wait for a new update to see what other cool features I can use in the future!,1
"I never rate apps but this is the best habit/task/tracker app I've ever used, and the only one I've ever stuck with. It's simple, powerful, extremely easy to customize, and intuitive to use. The one-time premium purchase is completely worth the price for the expanded features. I've eliminated every other paper planner, calendar, listpad, and app. Everything is in one place and I'm actually getting things done and feeling good about building habits! 11/10 stars.",1
"It's like someone else is watching your habits to keep you in check so you can create new habits, without someone telling you have to to where you don't want to do it. The set up is perfect abd easily customizable even without paying for the premium. Definitely would recommend. No annoying ads getting in the way of running the app for what you need.",1
"i like that this app is easy to use, without much of a learning curve. great and simple functionality! i can track all of my recurring tasks, one-time tasks, and habits, all in one place. awesome. my only complaint is that I can't mark a recurring task as complete until the day it's scheduled - so if, e.g., i have a bill due on Oct 25 and I pay it on Oct 15, i cannot yet mark it as completed. regardless, though, i paid for the premium version, and i almost never pay for apps. it's just great.",1
"I really like this app so far, it has a clean look and is simple to use, without the unnecessary frills that clutter up some similar apps. I also love that it's a one-time payment for premium rather than a subscription! The only thing I wish it had is an option to leave completed tasks/habits showing on the list, but have them faded or grayed out. I like being able to see what I've done today, but the little checkbox isn't enough for my brain to seperate them out from the tasks I have left to do",1
"I got this app to track my medication and it's perfect! I can set up how I want to take each medicine (yes/no or quantity), see the start date and adherence in the summary view, and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary. And the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database! Added bonus: I can track real to-dos as well. Overall, love this app!",1
"Helpful, but needs a way to quickly customize the order of the goals. Currently the choices are alphabetical, by priority, etc, but I would prefer a click and drag option to have them show up in the widget in the specific other I would like. I had to go into each goal and add a specific time to each one too get them in the order I want, even though I don't want to do them at a specific time.",1
If your looking for a good app for tasks/reminders with notifications and customizations this is totally for you! I absolutely love this app and it's super helpful for daily/weekly tasks and events! Its also super easy to use and totally free. I was really struggling finding a good app to remind me to do things but this is just perfect! It never feels like a burden to need to plan tasks/reminders anymore.,1
"For me, the app is intuitive. They recently changed from a number pad to a +/- system to record amounts. The problem for me is that it only shows whole numbers and 0 decimal places. The habits I have been tracking most need the decimals, so I do not like this change. The +/- entry would be ok if it allowed for the decimal place. I'm bumping this up to a 5 star from my original 4 star rating since it does allow for the decimal place--I just didn't know it at the time I wrote the original review",1
"I am not at all a disciplined man in any area of my life. Drinking, eating, sleeping, or literally anything. This app helps you keep track of tasks that need to be done as well as bad habits that you want to quit to help make a better strategy for quitting. It catagorizes tasks by daily, regular, or one time. For the daily ones (dishes) it tells you how long your streak is which is really rewarding. I haven't used it for long yet but I can already tell it will be an incredibly useful tool",1
"I use this to remember to do my usual chores and maintain my writing and workout habits. It's not a motivation thing so much as a forgetful thing. This app ensures I do it all. Haven't really noticed the ads on this app, so that probably means they did them very well. Ease of use for me would be if they removed one off tasks as the primary focus, I'm not going to write down every little thing I'm going to do for just one day. That's not really a critique though, just a personal preference.",1
"Clean interface, sleek design, and very motivating to see yourself build your streak. I've tried other apps that are too clunky to use, not visually appealing, or just not properly built enough that I wouldn't even bother to try and log in any habits...this however with the dark theme is beautiful and fulfilling to use. I got the pro version and didn't regret it! No subscription based pay is a huge plus too!! Great app and big thanks to the developers!",1
"If you want a completely free app use Loop Habit Tracker, however, this app honestly is worth it. Bought premium with Google rewards credit and it's honestly pretty nice, especially since you don't have to pay a stupid subscription. Built in timer is helpful, icons are nice, and everything's just useful without bloat, very nice. Edit: my only criticism is that if you change out of the app it will cancel the current habit being created, which can be annoying.",1
I never had to deal with ads cuz I paid for it right off but this app has been incredibly helpful for me. I like that it separates habits from one time tasks and appreciate how easy it is to add and remove them. The one thing I think this app could benefit from is a pause or postpone button for the habits. Most of my habits are centered on cleaning my home so if I'm on vacation I won't be able to complete them.,1
This is the only app that was simple and not confusing. I do homeschool and this is really helpful to organize my day with. I've gotten on a better schedule and become more healthy i love this app! If you looking for grocery list options this works for that as well as timers and such..I would recommend to start a alarm option as well for the people that dont have an alarm option it has a planner for everything!100% recommend!,1
This app is everything that I was looking for. There were so many good things that I wanted to keep motivated to do for my health but they always kept falling through the cracks. With this app I can keep track of everything and know how well I'm doing with each habit/task with the percentages they provide. I also love that there are reminders you can set. This has been super helpful to remind me to take my medication and I love that I can track if I missed a day! Overall super awesome app!,1
"Had it an hour before deciding to purchase the app. Great way to manage my specific workout schedule as well as other daily habits and tasks. Took me some time to figure out how to organize everything best for me because my workout plan changes. For example, I want to burn 1200 or more calories a day, sometimes more, so I set the habit at least 1200 and can enter actual burned calories. It calculates for the goal duration how many total I burned. Love this app!!",1
"It would be helpful if you could create habits with a numeric daily goal that could end once a total goal was reached. For example: a habit where you read 30 minutes a day could end once you read 10 hours. Edit: another suggestion is to add an auto-fail feature for habits/recurring tasks that don't get completed in the day. Currently, if a habit scheduled for the day goes uncompleted, the next day it won't show up as failed, it'll just show up as unchecked.",1
"Excellent app ! I had been using ""to do"" lists to keep track of or stay motivated with certain things. A normal day my list may say 1)grocery store 2)pay bill 3)don't smoke 4)at least walk if you're not going to gym etc etc ! Until this app I've never thought of separating them as ""goals-habits-tasks"" etc and this is SUPER HELPFULL as you can look at your progress is simple graphs and it spells it all out for you ! For me its indispensable!",1
"I like it, but I do really wish it gave more options for cumulative amounts for a week or month. For instance, I try to eat 30 different plant foods each week, though with no specific number each day as long as I hit the overall goal. All it would take is a drop down for the numerical value option where you can select week. I'd also like to add a certain number of minutes of exercise per week but run into the same issue.",1
"This app is exactly what I was looking for! You can have tasks repeat daily, weekly, monthly, every three days, every Tuesday and Thursday, etc. You can also add one-time tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it. This has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things. My one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order. Besides that, it is GREAT üëç",1
"A top-notch habit tracker. Slick, non-invasive, helped me develop a few routines to boost my productivity. The only issues so far is that ""Hide Completed"" is not really compatible with marking lapses. For the latter, you need to toggle twice, but the entry disappears on the first toggle. Some solutions might be introducing a timer before the entry disappears, so I can have time to mark a lapse, or having a different interaction to mark those - e.g. double-taps.",1
"I have ADHD and this app is the first that has actually helped me find a routine and remember self care. The UI is simple and very well designed. It shows you all the critical info you need and doesn't get bogged down by clutter. The app is fast and snappy and doesn't throw pop ups and ads in your face that could easily make me not want to use it, which is bad for an app designed to help you remember things! I highly recommend this app.",1
"While using a traditional planner, I often forget when to do things because I'm not constantly checking it throughout the day. This app helped solve that issue. My only complaint is that I can't snooze/turn off reoccurring tasks for specific days. For example, I have a reoccurring task set for when I need to leave for class. But if class is canceled, I dont want to change the setting (and forget to change it back) or delete the task.",1
"From day 1, which was 8 days ago, I've been loving this app. It's intuitive and SIMPLE. I immediately paid the $4.99 ONE-TIME fee to get Premium and no ads. Worth. It. I'm already challenging myself on about 8 habits I'm trying to develop. I like that I can add a note on a habit, for each day, if I want to keep track of slip-ups, and why, or if I have an ""Aha!"" moment. I also love the tasks list. I placed HabitNow app smack dab in the middle of my main screen, where I can't miss it.",1
"I rarely leave reviews on apps but I must have tried 10 apps for tasks and habit trackers and this one is by far the best. It has a very nice widget . It's simple user interface and very easy to add tasks day to day. I love the ""pending task"" option so if I can't get to a particular task that day it automatically adds it to the next day until completion. The ONLY thing I wish it had was a repeat option for tasks. It only has it for habits but it's not a deal breaker!",1
"Fantastic! This app is visually appealing, easy to use, and is exceptionally customizable with notifications and reminders. I love the ability to categorize desired habits and set their importance. The only limiting factor is that it seems to be a little more designed for people with a standard work schedule. I've suggested adding a feature that would help for those with a changing work schedule.",1
"I like what this app has to offer. However, there is one thing I would change. I have set up a few weekly and monthly goals as checklists and unfortunately, if I don't mark all items on the checklist by the end of a respective day, the habit is marked as failed/incomplete and the checklist resets. I would love an update that allows for checklist progress to carry over throughout a desired period (week, month, etc) so as to be reset/deemed as failed only when the week/month/etc has passed.",1
"This is the best app ever for someone who loves to track habits and tasks. The widget feature is amazing. The fact that you can set a habit to occur a certain amount of times in a certain period (3x/week, 4x/month, etc) is amazing. My only feedback is to be able to track the number of something without having a minimum of 1. E.g. I want to not drink alcohol most days, but when I do drink I want to track how much I drank. But don't want to set a minimum of 1 cus really it should be 0.",1
"I've used/tried several habit apps and have been frustrated by lack of features, poor UI design, other limitations. I decided to give it another go and I'm so glad I did. HabitNow is pretty much what I would build myself if I had the time. The big thing that's missing though, is visualization of the past week for all habits. A scrollable version of that going back at least a month would be nice as well.",1
"This app gets it all basically PERFECT, and you should not hesitate to try it out. It's very simple, straightforward, multi-functional, and well-designed to boot. My only critique is that the Tasks page should be presented as a tab on top of the screen just as the Today and Habits pages; there's no reason to hide your Tasks schedule while keeping Today and Habits easy to find. I'm also not sure if there is any way to integrate with my default calendar app. But overall, amazing!",1
"This app is so helpful. I reviewed a lot of different routine apps, schedule apps, and habit apps. Most of the other ones say you get a free 7-day trail and then asks for a yearly prescription that are way too expensive $30-$60. This app makes it very easy to understand, especially when you play around with all the different options, and you can personalize it the way you want.It lets you put at least 7 tasks or habits for free, but if you want unlimited, it's only $4.99! It's worth it great app",1
"I love how simple this app is. I've tried full GTD systems, which are too complicated for me. By keeping things simple, this app forces you to prioritize. I don't need hundreds of tasks organized in a hierarchy, just a simple app to keep my goals in sight. This app does it with a beautiful easy-to-read interface. Tip: You have to be creative with the sorting order to make it work for you. For example, I sort my today list by: 1. Priority; 2. Habits first. 3. Time. It works beautifully for me.",1
"This app is super easy to use, helps me stay on top of tasks, and offers a good selection of options. It would be nicer if they had more options for tasks. Unfortunately you have to pay for some of the extra things like having unlimited habit creations. It limits to about 8 for the free version. Overall, great app üëç even with the limited amount of tasks, this is the best one out there. Plus there's no ads üòÄ",1
"Good UX design. Quick and easy to add a task to my todo list. I like how the plus button and the option to select a new task are right by my thumb, I don't have to click all over the screen. I'd be interested to see more statistics and features in the settings. I like how minimal the app is, so if they add anything I hope they don't put it in a place that will bloat it, or require extra steps. I like the quick and easy UX. Happily purchased the pro version to support good app development.",1
"I downloaded habit now to get myself healthy again. I needed an easy way to keep track of how well I'm doing for certain goals like stretching every morning, drinking water ect. Being able to look and see if your if your improving or not is great. I paid for premium and love it. Keep up the good work! NEW PAID USER TIPS! Look closely at everything! Play around in your habit settings. You can customize a lot more than you think at first glance. Alarms, category/icon creation, widgets ect..",1
"I've been using this app for about two years now, whilst trying other habit tracking apps simultaneously. I am confident to say that this app almost lacks nothing, AND the developers have been doing a pretty good job with updates and development for the app has gotten better considerably since I've start using it. I said almost because this app doesn't have an online version that can be accessed via a browser or a desktop app. I'd love to see an online version soon.",1
"I think this app is fantastic. The free version lets you set up to 7 habits daily, which can cover a lot that you need to do in the day, I managed with the free version for months and it helped me keep a healthy routine. Each habit is easily customisable as well, you can set which days of the week you want to do that habit, you can set something to be a one time task, you can write descriptions, have individual daily goals for each habit, and also reminders and alarms.",1
"I struggle immensely with building habits, routines, and generally remembering things. The optional reminders, prioritization, and organization already make the free version amazing! Even if for the screen widget alone, the upgraded version is worth it. Lol, I actually feel capable of regular hygeine!",1
"Awesome app! What I think could be improved is to have the habits tracked with a graph. Also, instead of answering with a yes or no if the habit was made, maybe to answer with some sort of rating (if you are, or not satisfied with how much you completed, if it makes sense). If not, the app is great, works fantastic for me!",1
"It's a good app, if you have only one device. I installed it on my tablet only to find out that it only backs up to the cloud every other day, and there's no support for multiple devices so I can only use it on my phone. Other than that it's a great app.",1
"Since I always have my phone on or near me, this is a great way for me to keep my lists of things to do close by.",1
"I'm finding this app helpful for tracking my habits and giving me reminders when I need them. One minor complaint would be with checklist habits; they only seem to mark as ""failed"" if you've partially completed the list - empty checklists are always ""pending,"" even days later. I can't find an option to set the status manually, or e.g. options where I can customise what I want the app to do with empty checklist at the end of the day.",1
Hi guys. nice app you made here. I hope you made a streak counter in the widget version. thanks,1
"It's a good app, but the lack of documentation makes it really hard to figure out. I am sure this app will do way more than I am using it for, but it's trail and error to figure out how to use it.",1
Easy to keep track of productivity tasks üëç,1
Keeps me accountable,1
Using the app for sometime and I like it,1
Really helpful üëè,1
I wish there was a PC version,1
How to share application with others,1
"It's cool, but I wish the checklist was included.",1
Very good app always help me for good habits reminder,1
"Almost perfect: Please add a feature such that when I complete my daily habit, it shows my current streak. (Right now, it is hidden in the statistics section, which is not that motivational)",1
"I installed it yesterday only and I'm really loving it, so good features to track your habits. Except one thing i.e we can't login other devices and if we uninstalled the app for formatting the phone device can we get the backups of all data of habitnow again if I installed again? This is the reason I want to login in my laptop. Rather than this, it is so great app and helps so much in progress",1
I love this app.,1
Makes my schedule easy to use.,1
Nice one usefull,1
It's amazing! I love that it is a lifetime premium subscription but please make it available on iOS!!! I told my sister about it and she instantly asked where to find it but she couldn't cause she's on iOS... ü´§,1
Good. Only thing is it would be handy to have a calculation of time between dates and to be able to set long term goals where it can count down until goal achieved. Then perhaps within the long term goal be able to set the daily habits and 'To Dos' to achieve that goal.,1
üëçüèª,1
"Good app, but I want analysis of all habits and my performance i.e Complete Dashboard/Statistics of whole day/week/month/year performance of all habits But app limitation is only upto one habit i.e I can view statistics of only one habit and not all the habits.I'm a premium user.This is lacking feature.Please provide this feature if you can.Also a widget of Dashboard of day/week/mon/year and widget of weekly progress of particular habit.one more feature: provide a feature for sharing Statistics",1
Good app,1
First day using it ill change the review by years end if i make it ill give 5 stars. Lmao,1
Love this app the premium feature is soo good,1
Good,1
Best..... but need some free options,1
"Really good so far, it would be nice to be a ble to assign personal prizes",1
"Best habit tracker, very configurable. One improvement to request based on my experience - alarm button only has the option to snooze or dismiss, would prefer to also have the option on done.",1
Love the app overall but would loooove if there was a way to like copy or duplicate tasks. Sometimes I have a big checklist I want to copy because one factor is different and it's a pain you have to type it all out twice. Could be cool to be able to duplicate tasks then be able to edit them.,1
"The reason i am rating 4 stars, when I edit one of my habits, previous details remain the same. Please fix this bug.",1
Still learning to use this app but love the flexibility and non overwhelming non distracting structure.,1
"I love, love ,love this app ! I like that the daily view tracks single task, recurring tasks and habits (with stats). Amazing, best organizational and tracking app!   Suggestion: for the ""today"" view, it showing me the # of items completed w/ the total # of checklist items (which is fine if I needed ""all"" the items 2 be met) However, once I customize it to a specific # then I only want to see the # of items completed w/ the # of items that is needed to be successful for that day,week...etc",1
"This is a great app with a beautiful interface. It's so easy to track your habits with HabitNow, and helps make it so simple and easy to do. I paid for premium because it was incredibly cheap, and very worth it because it gives you full access to the app, and infinite habits. All the hater 1 star posts are ridiculous and embarrassing. Download it!",1
"This is exactly the functionality I needed for reminders to keep track of my daily, weekly, and monthly tasks and goals. I appreciate that there aren't ads, I am using the free version and would even consider upgrading because it is only for a one time fee! So that checks just about every feature I want in an app.",1
"I've only used the app for a couple days now, but so far I'm very impressed. It provides so much more flexibility in recording and tracking than other task lists. I've never seen an app that gives so many options for how or when to complete things. There's not enough space to share all the features I love, but it works with the way I work, and that's new and lovely!",1
"This app is definitely the best daily routine planner app out there! No ads, no commentary and it's still working great even without the premium version. I've tried many habit tracker apps and routine planner apps, but most of them only offers bad usage experience and there are limits without the premium version. However, this app is on the contrary it's really convenient to use and the system is easy to understand. I'll be using this great app for years after years.",1
This is a very useful app. Even the free version while it limits you for recurring things still gives you 7 of them that you can monitor and track. It also allows you to set as many single tasks as you would like to set reminders to do different things. So starting out with just 7 recurring let's you test it out to see if it helps and if it does its only a one time purchase of $5 to get everything. I would highly recommend this app.,1
"Purchased it. I am also reading ""Atomic Habits"" as well. I am wanting to cultivate better habits to improve multiple areas and this app lets me do that. I just have 4 habits (as of now). Since I am able to see them it really keeps me accountable when I can click on them as a sign of success. The app is easy to navigate, UI is nice. No major issues as of now.",1
"I love the app so far. You can make a list of all sorts of tasks and get notified/reminded when you need to do those tasks. And if you are like me often forgetting things then this will be perfect for you. You can set a reminder for only a specific day and, or you can set a reminder for a task to go off every day of the week, the options are various. It's free and that's what I like also. The app has more options then just task reminders. Five stars for sure. Worth installing.",1
"Excellent. Exactly what I wanted. Set up your habits and mark them as complete or not complete. Set a time for them so they're in order, and that time can also be a reminder notification or an alarm. You can look back at your progress, % complete, and its good. Had ti buy premium for more than 7(?) Habits I think but it's well worth the cost.",1
"Holy Flexibility, Batman!! I have never found another app as flexible or as easy to use ""right out of the box"" as this one. The free version is good to get you started, but the premium version is the way to go. More importantly, it won't break the bank to get it and its lifetime - not a subscription (as of this review). The goals and awards keep you motivated and the simplicity means that it isn't a chore to keep track of your chores. I highly recommend HabitNow! Thanks, Devs and great job!!",1
"I needed a basic habit tracker and have found this a ton more useful than the printouts and spreadsheets I've used before. Perfect for simple uses, habits, and tasks. It's not a project or whole life management system, and that's okay. The free plan gives everything you need, but the Premium plan gives some additional customization and added features to the widgets. Overall, I've been super happy with this app, and it has helped me actually stay on top of tracking habits. I highly recommend it.",1
"Quite good, been using for years for daily habits. Pros: the calendar to look back and see how I'm doing, the auto pending yellow status on days when you forgot to log, the ability to change past days' status, custom category names, options for habit freq - even allow you to log completions after reaching weekly goal, tacks that allows you to still see old history after switching habit freq, archived habits (not just delete) Cons: just calendar can't scroll yet",1
"Worth it. Premium also very worth it. I have downloaded so many apps to help me stay organized. I have ADHD and I just needed lots of options, flexibility, colors, etc. This is it. It's the whole package. The different types of tasks and categories and reminders you can customize are endlessly flexible. I love that I can set reminders for different days within one task; without having to make another task. Wow.",1
"I've been looking for a habit tracker that balances the nuisances of varying habit types with a simple, streamlined interface. AND THIS IS IT. I am thrilled!! My favorite feature is the option to add checklists within a habit and select how many need to be done to count as a ""success"" - as a person who struggles with perfectionism this helps me to still see progress without beating myself up that it wasn't all completed. A B- still passes!!",1
"I first reviewed this app 5/30/21 and hadn't looked at it again until now. I had given it 3 stars and didn't use it because you couldn't easily reorder lists and had to assign times. I'm looking at the app now, 2.5 years later,and WOW! They have improved those issues I had and went further! It looks awesome, and I can't wait to use it!",1
"Really helpful and motivational, once I figured it out. Give yourself an hour to set up properly, the rest is easy peasy. Now all I have to do is open the app to see my tasks for the day, and I can separate by category. I made custom filters ""self care"", ""chores"", and ""tasks"". They also have a way to track avoiding bad habits. If you need vacation mode, there's a ""skip"" option to complete the task for the day without affecting your stats.",1
"This has been by far the best schedule, habit builder, and task app I've come across. What makes it even better is that a majority of the features seem to available on the free version, there are no ads popping up all over the screen blocking your work, and if you do choose to get the premium version its a One-time purchase, not a subscription.",1
"The free version has incredible configuration and options available. I LOVE the fact that the premium version is a one time payment - extremely reasonable and I'm happy to support the developer as they've clearly worked hard on this app! I hate subscriptions for apps like this, the fact that it was a one time purchase sold me if the quality of the app hadn't already. I wish I could choose custom accent colors rather than additional preset ones with premium but that's not a deal breaker",1
Love this app with more features.,1
Useful. Recommended.,1
It's a great app..It would be greater if I could create havit and recurring tasks as much as I want in free plan..,1
"This is such a good app. It just makes me feel organized and lets me remember what I need to do throughout the day. I had downloaded this because I felt very unorganized, but now I've been using it and love itüëç",1
Helping me to keep track of habits I wish to build,1
Very useful,1
good üëç,1
Kamal ki app hai,1
Great!!,1
What a great app we've got here üôÇüëèüëè,1
"Excellent App. I bought the premium too, and has amazing options to track your habits ! There is a suggestion. I have a lot of habits and What happens is that for example in my 20 habits if I am trying to archive a habit number 17, then after archiving the Habit when I press the back button the home screen returns to the first habit it should not happen and should remember the position I was last in",1
Nice app,1
Great for adults with ADHD. Most of these apps say they are but alot of people with ADHD need very simple way of organizing. This is the ONLY app I have been able to sit and organize without feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. I love the simplicity and organization of this app. It's the only one I have stuck with for more then 2 days. Awesome app.,1
"I'm a SAHM wanting to establish a better daily routine, as well as fit in some bigger tasks each day if possible. This app is absolutely perfect for what I need. I love that the daily items don't get carried over to the next day if you don't complete them. And I love that the app doesn't constantly ask you if you want to go premium. But I went premium after one day, because I loved this app so much. Plus it's a one time fee, not a monthly fee, so I'm far more inclined to purchase. Thanks devs!",1
"Awesome app. So easy to use. Even the free version is extremely useful, but I upgraded to premium to get additional benefits. At only $4.99 (one time only), it seems to be a bargain. It's helping me to be much more productive and organized. Plus, I'm finally taking some weight off with my reminders to drink water and avoid processed carbs. When I don't get all my tasks done in a day, it just rolls it over to the next day. I can't find anything to complain about. Well designed and executed.",1
I love that this app takes actually feedback into account and is a one time purchase. It keeps getting better. However one thing that I do wish was implemented was a goal category. I wish I could make long term goals and have them in a separate tab to look at. For example the goal of in one year I want to lift 150 pounds or something.,1
Everything is perfect for me except it doesn't reflect system font and this app looks odd. What has to be done here. Pls support.,1

Really easy to setup and use.,1
"This app has helped me with lots of stuff, from spending less money, to lower my Xanax dose steadily to half of what I was taking.",1
"Always needed something which could keep stats and help me analyse my growth. Just bought the premium, thanks alot teamüíö",1
Loving it so far getting my life in order,1
Veru good! Free version is enough for basic use,1
Good shiiitttttt.... Helped me change a lot,1
Amazing app,1
"After trying 3 other apps for ADHD that take you through a ""special"" test, I found this one. The others make give email to continue, use verbage that makes you feel you cannot succeed without THEIR app, only to tell you to pay or quit, and it's a monthly subscription by the way! HabitNow plainly tells you what you get, offers premium features and plainly tell you what that gets you and it is a one time fee. The difference between caring is obvious here.",1
Incredible nothing short of just amazing app,1
I am a student and forget all tasks. So This app really helped me in reminding all of my daily work that needs to be done at right time.,1
"This is perfect for everyday use, helps you keep track of everything you need to do, and it's user friendly.",1
So far so good,1
"OG: Devs & app are stinking awesome!! The first time block app that doesn't force you to tether everything to a specific time. THANK YOU!!üòçüôèPro is totally worth it. ETA: 1. Noticed of notifications still go off, even when task rescheduled. 2. How would you recommend tracking a completion goal? Ex: updated total% daily. 3. Consider having a ""days/weeks left in the year"" widget? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•",1
Nice Useful App,1
"Good, good, good! The only thing I would like is a children's mode. Also, the premium version is not well priced. It's too expensive. Thank you!",1
Great experience! I love the way I can track my habits with the app. So happy that I purchased the premium version for lifetimeüòç,1
"UPDATE: After trying literally every goal/habit app on PS I reinstalled this and it works perfectly - OUTSTANDING app, gorgeous UI and LOADED with features and options not found on other apps. Absolutely the best available! 2021: I have reinstalled the app and am trying it again to see if I made some kind of mistake causing the problem I've had. The developers are wonderful about helping solve problems so it's worth trying again!",1

"The best! I'm usually not a fan of rating apps since I'm too lazy to give my opinion, but this app is just soooooo good. I love how everything is just so simple and organized. I really love this app. The best part is that there's only one time payment if you wanna have better experience(premium) I look forward for new and cool features in the future update‚ò∫Ô∏è",1
Omg it its the best thing that happened to me,1
Awesome üëç VERY helpful and knowledgeable ‚òÜ‚óã,1
Very good concept and app. It really helps to manage your daily tasks.,1
I love a list - and this simple app makes creating new daily/weekly habits simple,1
"I really like this app and the possibilities I have to personalize and structure my day. These apps are really ""personal"" but I suggest to anyone who needs help remembering and structuring the day to at least try this app.",1
"One of the best habit trackers I have ever used, it's simple but effective and gives you a lot of freedom (even if you decide not to buy the full version) I am currently a free member but I am definitely going to upgrade to premium.",1
Easy to use,1
"A must for productivity. I switched from LifeRPG to this app. Very good, 5/5",1
Amazing features,1
"This has been by far the best schedule, habit builder, and task app I've come across. What makes it even better is that a majority of the features seem to available on the free version, there are no ads popping up all over the screen blocking your work, and if you do choose to get the premium version its a One-time purchase, not a subscription.",1
"This could be the perfect Android app if it had just two more features. It would be nice to be able to either delete or uncheck all checked items. For example, with a long shopping list it would be nice to be able to delete everything at once that has been checked. And for a long packing list it would be nice to be able to uncheck everything once you have packed. Add these two features and it's the perfect notes app.",1
"Great todo app. The only thing I dislike is how recurring tasks are handled. When a recurring task is completed, it gets copied to a new task. This adds clutter and is annoying to undo when you accidentally complete a task. I'd rather it didn't create new a task, but instead just ""uncompleted"" the original task when it was time for it to recur (ie. each day/week/month). Currently I work around this by having separate lists for recurring tasks, and manually ""uncompleting"" them as needed.",1
"Update: auto suggestions feature is out of control. This app used to be Wunderlist and I loved it. After some initial wonkiness, Microsoft finally worked out the bugs. But now a new one continues to rear its head: every time you do an update, the auto suggestions turn back on even though you turned them off. This may only be an Android issue but it's super annoying because I hate the feature. I don't know of anyone who likes having their settings reset upon every update.",1
"When I heard Wunderlist was being replaced by this I was dismayed at first. It doesn't have all the same features as Wunderlist yet (Week View please!), but what it does have works really well, and sometimes MUCH better (synching for example). Now it's my most-used app each day. EDIT: Only problems I have right now is when using the website it causes some sub-tasks in recurring tasks to multiply or it might remove an item from your daily list after you mark it as complete!",1
"Perfect for 5 min quickies list. Not so good for projects and whole life organizer like the my effectiveness app. Frustrations list: Can't delete long, long list of completed items as a batch. It is one by one. Ouch! Tasks under an item can not be moved to arrange by priority or logical sequence of events. Delete the whole task list and remake it in the order you need it to be. Ouch! No text colors or font options or highlighting.",1
"UPDATE: Yesterday I finally got an email with instructions to fix the problem and everything is working again! APP DELEATED ALL OF MY LISTS AND I CAN'T GET HELP RESTORING THEM I've been using Microsoft's app for a few years and it was working well until suddenly all of my lists disappeared and I can't create new ones because I get an odd message that says ""initializing please wait"" then nothing happens. I opened a help request but haven't heard a thing!",1
"Some new features soon would be much-appreciated, like maybe some kind of reward system or statistics to see how far you've come, or more nuianced priority levels (versus important/not important), or natural language processing (""water plants tomorrow"" adds the task for tomorrow). Just because the app is free doesn't mean it has to be barebones.",1
"I tried out several to do apps to replace my sun-setting Wunderlist and liked this one the best. The only feature I'm missing at this point (and it is a big one, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) is a list of all tasks/to dos. One master list of everything from all other lists is a crucial feature and very much needed! For now I am marking all tasks as important so they are all captured there as a workaround. P.s. I am loving the tags feature, and the audio when you check a task off. So fulfilling!",1
"A good app for managing to-do items and simple lists. It needs a few enhancements to be a full GTD organizer, but is still the best free one I've found that gets pretty close. The online integration so that the same lists/tasks are accessible from various platforms/ locations is a valuable and necessary feature some miss. I use it for managing my home and business to-do lists as well as a grocery list, lists of books I want to read, movies I want to see, etc. and it works very well for these.",1
"This app works great. Very helpful for listmakers! Easy to add things, check off, make multiple lists and sublists. Only improvement I would make is in how you can organize the items on a list. You can do it by due date, alphabetically, etc, or all manually. I would like to sort some by due date, etc, and then have the option to order the others manually. Not an all or none option only. But that is a small thing. It is really quite helpful.",1
"If you like Wunderlist, you should try this instead. Seems more logically organized, and I don't need to confirm every deletion in this app! I'd like to have the option for location based reminders like I can do in Cortana. So, it can remind me to stop for groceries when I leave the office, for example. Then maybe allow using both spatial and temporal reminders together!",1
"Overall this is a great app for keeping track of what I need to do. Easy to use interface and clean layout. However, there is one big thing I wish they'd change. Pros: Clean layout Easy to use Good organization with different lists Cons: Can't change default alert options-- when you want an alert that's not one of the three default options, you have to change it manually every time you add a new task Would also like the ability to customize snooze durations",1
Great app but one small thing annoys me. Everytime the app is updated the settings default to 'Play completion sound' on. I don't want a sound when I check that a task has been completed. Therefore every time there is an update I have to go into settings and switch 'Play completion sound' to off. A small thing but annoying and it would presumably be very easy to leave this setting as whatever the user has chosen.,1
"I've been using this app for at least 4 or 5 years now (when it was Wunderlist and now as Microsoft To Do). I use it constantly for weekly lists, groceries, and it has been wonderful for keeping track of odds and ends over time like books I want to read, music to listen to, etc. I like that you can attach documents. Only downside is I wish I could customize it more with different color schemes. Overall, very user-friendly.",1
Nice app,1
"I love the app so far. I really like how user friendly it is. But this app has a very limited selection of themes. Please offer more themes to choose from. Also, offering the ability to choose our own images from our computer or the internet for our task background would be great. Even though I chose not to use the Trello Task app, they have the above features I mentioned, and I loved having those options.",1
Great overall look and feel to the app. One big thing I wish was available as a feature: Please provide an option on list settings to delete all completed tasks! I don't want to individually select many completed tasks in order to delete them when I still have tasks on a list. Even a select all completed tasks option would be useful in this scenario.,1
"A great app, and so close to being perfect! I just desperately wish it had a way to queue tasks so you know what to do next (perhaps being able to manually add tasks to Suggestions, or create your own queue). I like to plan out what I want to do the next day, in the given week, and in the month, and having different lists doesn't really cut it, since I also use lists for categorization of the kind of task, rather than the time frame in which I plan to do them. Otherwise, it's fantastic",1
"Mostly great, but unable to recover deleted items. If you accidentally delete a task or entire list, it's effectively irrecoverable. The standing advice from Microsoft is to go into your Outlook (???) and restore the items in your Deleted Items folder. However, only a subset of what I deleted was there and restoring had no effect in the To-Do app. Pretty silly data handling. The other features in the app are good and offer more organizational tools than other task lists at least.",1
"This is the best free task and project app that I found. used to use Wunderlist which this was based off of, but their first versions had few features. They really did a great job of rounding this out. I do wish that it had a tag or category feature. I was using Outlook for my email for a while but decided to go back to Gmail. That has made turning emails into tasks look more complicated. But this is much better than Google's task app, so I stayed with it.",1
"Great app, don't have any complains",1
Awesome,1
"It's really best app to use ,to make a habit and staying up consistent and the best part of app is it shows statistics rate of our work and maintains streak to stay consistent....",1
"Even after making payment for the premium version today on 26th March 2024, access to premium version is not provided. I hope you address the problem. Payment details are shared through customer care support email. Rating will be revised after the issue is addressed. Kindly do the needful.",1
I think this application has the best mechanism to help you keep your routine. You can analyze all that you do without get confused. I love it,1
"Very good experience, please make a desktop version",1
Cool easy-to-use app at an affordable premium price!,1
Perfect,1
Everything is just perfect. Thanks a million.,1
"Awesome I love this app, it is so comprehensive and versatile it its I use it for things I used to use multiple apps for! And it is truly helping me form the good habits I could only manage intermittently before, I highly recommend it",1
"Getting better! The UI is becoming more modern, and I've always enjoyed the My Day feature. Some things I would like to see change include: removing or making optional the background image on lists; would like to see the title of the list at the top of the UI instead of mandating that space to an image. Also, there needs to be more integrations with other apps and services, instead of wunderlist.",1
Awesome application.... I should have discovered this a long time ago....,1
Tried several apps before and this is where I'm stopping,1
I like this app it's very simple for what I need it for and it was only a six dollar purchase for life I would completely recommend it great work guys.,1
Excellent,1
üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,1
Love the app and brought premium version. One section can be added which is miscellaneous section for the tasks which are pending and can be done any day.,1
I rarely rate any app and I've never left a detailed review before but this app is fabulous. I've been using it for months now and it has truly helped me being more organized and goal oriented person. Thank you to the wonderful team for this app!,1
This app is very good for keeping track of things that you need to do.,1
Just perfect.,1
"HabitNow does what it says it's going to do, and it's emotionally friendly, meaning that I have been inspired instead of guilt ridden.",1
Useful,1

"Great app, beautiful to use",1
Very good application. Thank you very much. LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è NAMASTE üôè VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE.,1
Wow nice app it helps me a lot!!,1
"Great app! Intuitive, looks good, customisable, no adds so far, the free version is very comprehensive/ functional, and I haven't had the notification problems that someone else has mentioned. Thanks so much!",1
Totally helpfull,1
Easy to use and very helful,1
This app is just perfect üòçüòç,1
A masterclass of app design. This is the only app I have ever given money to since its designed so well and premium is a lump sum instead of subscription. My one suggestion would be a day planner notepad so we can write down schedules / ideas / plans / day reflections. Otherwise PERFECTION!,1
It helps me keep track even in my busy day to day,1
It is the best app for planning and creating new habits.,1
"Pay model is reasonable, currently on sale at 5 dollars. Even without paying, the limited number of habits/tasks are useful and worth the downloading. The statistics page is a nice addition. I have to add that the organization system leaves a lot to be desired, but if you carefully set the ""priorities"" and names of your habits/tasks you can get the desired order. It's a bit more of a hassle than I would like and If the app was more expensive I'd take a larger issue with it. Overall a nice app.",1
"When you have ADHD, you need simplicity. Too many apps geared toward ADHD have way too many things going on which can be overwhelming. We need simple, opposed to being bombarded with a hundred tips, tricks, and to do list stuff. Slow, steady, simple.",1
Simply awesome! I used to be a big fan of a differet app but stopped using it after a major UI change and I'd been searching for a way to establish and track good habits. This app is actually what I needed all along! The timeline view is the best part of the app and the ui is clear and uncluttered. I'm a big fan.,1
"Incredible and very helpful! It has no ads and none of that paywall nonsense. Free version comes with a lot of good features and the premium is an inexpensive one-time purchase. I have memory issues and been trying to introduce heathier habits into my life, getting this app has been a good choice for remembering to do things on the daily. Would recommend!",1
"Truly one of the BEST performing productivity apps around! As someone with an insatiable urge to try out every routine app in existence, the differences between a solid app and a poor one are hard to miss. The developers seemed to have focused on a design that revolves around it's powerfully utilized tools, making HabitNow like a Swiss army knife of productivity.",1
"This app is the best habit-building tool I've ever used. It's incredibly flexible in terms of what measures you use, how often you want to track, when notifications happen, and what your goals look like. I use it for everything from flossing to giving my dog her monthly meds. I bought the premium version and it was worth every penny. The customer service is also great. I sent an email about a feature I wanted and they got back to me right away telling me how to access the feature. I love it.",1
"I have found this app to be very helpful! I have tried several habbit and task trackers, and this one is by far the best. I love that I can categorize, set reminders, see a history of the progress I've made, set up checklists, and all for a reasonable price. All in one app. Bonus that the creator is open and responsive to suggestions!",1
"I paid right from the start for this app as I felt it would really help me as my memory tends to wonder and not stay on track. It's an awesome app. Each night I can plan out everything for the next day. Since I'm still new to it, I would like to be able to arrange the order for tasks, habits etc. For the day. Great app, Love it. Paid version is worth it.",1
"I adore this app. It does exactly what it needs to do and works perfectly for the casual user yet allows for advanced configurations for the power user. The only features it's current lacking that I would like to see are: - Browser Interface: Allow users to update habits/tasks in a browser. - Google/Outlook Calendar Integration: Create, Import and Update details across popular calendars. - Better Import/Export: Provide and easy to understand CSV export method and output file for bulk updates.",1
"Phenomenal! Easy to use, improves productivity and the premium price is worth 10x that at least. Well done. Thank you! UPDATE: An issue I experienced yesterday... I had a task set for 11pm that I completed during the day and marked complete, yet the reminder still went off at 11pm. Is that a setting, or something you might consider changing? Thanks so much!",1
"I wanted a habit app that can do two things: 1. Nicely supports weekly and daily habits 2. Shows me everyday what habits I have for the day. As simple as those sound, I didn't find any app that supported that in an easy way apart from HabitNow. My 1 request is to make swiping right/left in the Today's tab to switch between other dates. Simple change but much easier to do vs tapping the small date bubbles",1
Just Love this app....I tried many apps but they showed error some doesn't match my taste others useless or full of ads but this app is just amazing it didn't disappoint me it's a perfect fit for a fit freak like me üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,1
"Great app, can you please also add persistent notifications? That'd be really good to have.",1
Cool App,1
"I absolutely love this app!! Definitely worth the purchase, I find it incredibly helpful keeping me on track in my day to day life üòÅ",1
Amazing app. Does exactly what I need it to.,1
This has been super helpful for me in keeping my goals in focus and improving my healthy habits. 10/10 would recommend üëå,1
Great application!,1
App that changes life,1
I can definitely say best productivity app I've ever used!,1
Great üëç,1
Way better than lots of other apps I've tried. Shame they don't do a version for apple as my wife loves what I can do in the app.,1
Best app for habit tracking not need to buy premium you get almost all the things in free version then you can able to achive good results from them then try to purchase,1
"So many productivity things like to-do list, habit tracker, pomodoro or stopwatch and time in one app! Awesome!!",1
I love this app,1
Podr√≠an sacar una versi√≥n para Windows o web? Como Todoist? Gracias.,1
"This is one of the very few apps I paid for, and it was worth it. It helps my ADHD brain so much, and I'm able to keep my teeth healthy because of it! Love how customizable it is. The lists are a great addition. Love it!",1
Awesome and fun,1
Until now i love it,1
"This app has been awesome. I haven't had a single issue since install, many months ago. It's really helped me to stay organised and keep myself on track. The UI is nice as well. Everything overall is designed quite well.",1
Very useful. Creating daily checklists is very simple and user friendly.,1
User friendly,1
"I don't usually rate apps...But here it is my thanks to this app which is really helpful in several ways like user interface, simple handling, categories, reminder etc. It's amazing !!üáÆüá≥",1
This is exactly that I want,1
Amazing app! Excellent customer service too!,1
The premium version is beyond amazing. What is missing is statistical representation of the achieved habits.,1
I found this app useful and helps me in building good habits. I hit the premium button soon as I saw the discounted price to half. Hope they add more features and cross device sync henceforward.,1
"thank you so much for offering the lifetime purchase! im still on day 1 of trying this, but so far it seems to do what i need!",1
"Fantastic App. Great layout, great features.",1
THE BEEEESSSTT,1
Great app! Very user friendly.,1
Top,1
Easy to use,1
It good for the price.,1
easy to use,1
This app just keeps getting better!!!,1
"It's very user friendly. My only complaint with the app is that the information can't be sent or downloaded to your calendar. The app would be so much better if the information were sent straight to your calendar, or if it were an option. Just like a day planner, remember Franklin Covey? I couldn't survive without mine? Well actually I still can't, just in a digital world now! Thanks for the app. Maybe make it calendar compatible, just think about it, please?",1
nyc aap,1
Very usefull,1
"Amazing app, motivated me to start building new habits and organize my day. And it also have an unique way to track stats and gain coins which you can spend on your own rewards. Very customizable, but simple at the same time.",1
Very impressed,1
Encouraging accountability. A positive experience. Helps you improve incrementally or quickly if you take a whole 3 minutes out of your day to inventory your day,1
Top top top,1
I've used so many task organisation apps and this is hands down the best one out there! It pretty much has everything I could want in a task app. Props to the developer(s) for creating this.,1
Great UI. Super customizable. By far my favorite to do list app.,1
I've actually improved my life overall using this thing,1
"The best ""gamified"" app for people in a shared household - you can easily track tasks in a group in such a way that there are no duplicates - once the dishwasher is loaded by one person, it's done, and the doer gets credit. It's also been great for adding shared on-off jobs that one of us doesn't want to do very much - in addition to ""difficulty"" and ""importance"" sliders, there is a built in ""fear"" slider to measure your dread - get extra credit for doing something your spouse hates!",1
Don't know if this app is inspired by persona 4 but anyway this app is sick props to whoever made it,1
A fun way to stay motivated,1
I love RPGs so having a to do list with an RPG overlay is great fun. The interface can be a bit confusing to start with but once you find what you need the rest can just be back ground stuff. I'd love if I could get tasks as widgets for my lock screen so I don't always have to go into the app and just get that satisfying completion sound from the lock or home screen.,1
Me falta comprender algunas tareas pero es pr√°ctico y motiva,1
This has helped me in life so much at first it was overwhelming but once you put in a little effort every day to set it up it honestly helps SOO much with discipline and even motivation. I want to complete the challanges and reach the expectations I put on not just others but myself and surpass them. (NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART),1
"I quite like it, only drawback is when Ads pop up without warning. I'd appreciate an alert for ads when I have the app open",1
Easy to learn and gamifys life! Takes a minute to set up to do list and rewards and such. But just work on it a bit at a time as you go. Super helpful!!!,1
Great app! My motivation have risen a lot!,1
Me encanta,1
Game changing app. Now my life will never be the same. Leveling up my skills every single day,1
"This is a great app for someone like me. Due to my autism and ADHD I have issues with executive dysfunction. So doing daily tasks that are easy for most people can be hard for someone like me. The only way around this is chasing dopamine, which this app provides. There is only one suggestion I would like to give, the ability to reduce skills upon failure. So if I complete a task a skill will go up by 30%, but if I fail it will go down by 30%.",1
Amazing idea! I'm so glad someone made it happen. The xp system along with having not only skills but characteristics that are improved via the skills is amazing. Really makes life feel like a video game and sure it's still cope to an extent but it's cope that's getting stuff done. Thank y'all for making it!,1
Productivity goes üìà,1
I love it haveing game like stats for you irl is very fun to me,1
"I just discovered you can change the time and date when you complete a task! If I didn't have time yesterday to log in I can still collect my tasks without having a weird double day on my trackers. Very customizable and easy to add tasks and skills. There are ways to adjust the XP you earn it and it could be overwhelming, but you don't have to change any settings if you don't want to.",1
Very useful and fun to track your habits,1
"Super amazing app, i feel like kratos in my own greek mythology",1
"I really enjoy how easy this app is and how it helps keep you on track. I wrestle with motivation and so far, this app has helped. It's presently day two and I'm on track to get all my tasks done!",1
Noice,1
"this has features that might seem overwhelming at first, but with time gets easier. Right for one looking for utilities without compromising simplicity too much",1
This app has really helped me form better habits. I get a little dopamine boost whenever I mark something off and see my progress! I use it every day.,1
the one and only best app to gamify your life trust me download it right now ! I absolutely love it,1
Awesome concept amazing execution,1
Great to do list,1
"Really useful. I always procrastinate, but with this app i finally feel like what i do matters.",1
"An excellent app for tracking habits efficiently and easily! All this app needs now is for a Skip not to break a streak. Only a Fail should break a streak. I do wish the statistics page would list a handful (say, three to five) of the user's best streaks for a given habit, yielding an increased sense of satisfaction for improving. Currently, it shows the single best streak only. Can we also have percentages on the pie charts? This app is close to perfection!",1
"There's one bug that's unfortunate. The stopwatch is highly inaccurate when outside the app/sleeping screen, so it's hard to keep track of how much time you're actually putting into the goals. I tested if the watch was inaccurate, and after about 2~ minutes outside the app, I think the timer stops counting, since the stopwatch time only changed 2 minutes after I externally timed ~30 minutes. Other than that, it's wonderful! Bought premium as well.",1
"Been using this for a couple weeks, it really is helpful & rewarding to interact with! However, sometimes we plan to do something on specific days of the month, but miss one day and end up actually making up for it on an unscheduled day. There seems to be no way to add this into your existing track/statistic. The only thing you can do is make an entirely new track that includes your modified date. It's very demotivating to need a new track every time I mess up, and also dullens stat utility.",1
"The paid version with unlimited habits is pretty good. A nitpick is for things where the goal is to do ""less than"" some amount per day, it checks the box as soon as you start counting. It would be really useful to have a setting where it would only mark as complete when the day is finished, and just show the tally for that day until then. For example, I'm trying to quit smoking, but if I've smoked 4 cigarettes out of 6, it shows the habit as complete. It only shows the count in tiny letters",1
"Good, clean UI and design. The habit organization is nice, though a bit tedious if you have multiple habits that you want to see stats for. I'd like to see a calendar view with all the habits and tasks listed out, as well as historic completion rates. The tasks seem like they aren't fully fleshed out. I'd like to see persistent reminders for recurring tasks until they're completed.",1
"I just downloaded the app and enjoy it so far. I do have a suggestion for developers regarding breaking bad habits: it would be nice if there was an option for a counter, to track the number of times per day you perform the action/habit you want to stop and set a goal for it. Success is if you count the action equal or less times per day to your goal. It could be set up like the check list feature, touching the day for that habit opens a box with the counter. The goal can be reduced over time.",1
"Ive tried a lot off habit apps and like it better than others (paid). I like: -the options for icons, which also show in notifications -robust notification options -works offline. I've changed how I use the app, I use it for my tasks mostly. But it's great for that simple enough, I don't get overwhelmed. But the biggest problem with it is the icon in the notification tray is too generic. If I'm distracted, I don't instinctively know which app it is.",1
"Have been using this for a few weeks now I like it fairly well, but the lack of more detailed scheduling options (ie: 4 times every 60 days, not bound by actual months) is a little disappointing, as I have a habit to track that needs that kind of specificity. I've had to set it to four times per month instead, and then made creative use of the skip feature.",1
"App is really great, and premium is a one-time purchase instead of a subscription. However, one thing that's missing is a way to make the home screen to-do list more transparent. I'd really love to be able to see my background through the to-do list, and would gladly change my review to a 5-star if they added this functionality.",1
"Love it - would give it 5+ stars BUT after many, many, many hours of entering tasks, making custom icons, organizing checklists and priorities all my data suddenly disappeared. Everything is gone. I couldn't even enter new tasks. I had to uninstall the app in order to reinstall it. It seems to be working again now but all my data is gone. All my customization, settings, everything. I did not have it backed up on cloud. I recommend turning on backup.",1
"I like the app, but I wish it had two features: 1. A web interface - it would be a lot easier to use a computer to set up all my habits and it would also be nice to use it on my work computer for work tasks not strictly on my phone. 2. Google Calendar interface - again, it's OK to have a calendar in the app, but it's stuck in my little phone. Allowing it to be shown in my Google Calendar would help me see how it all fits together. Thanks guys!",1
"I've tried a few different steak trackers and this is the best one I've found so far. There is still room for improvement though. My biggest complaint is that when you've completed an x days/week habit for the week, it stops showing up on the daily list. I'd like an option to still see those there so that I can more easily log if I do that activity more than those x number of days. Maybe a setting on the habit itself so you can choose which ones show every day?",1
"Just downloaded this app and giving my first impressions. Was easy to get started. Created a list of 6 habits right away with ease. Very intuitive controls and nice interface. I like that I can have multiple reminders and they can be notifications or alarms. Update: I've uninstalled this app because if I dismiss an alarm while the phone is locked, the vibrate keeps going until I restart my phone. I haven't found a fix for this yet. Haven't reached out to company yet.",1
Great App and Experience. Glad I've got the Premium version Recommendation 1: An Official PC version. Those wanting to use this app on a PC must use an emulator (third-party app). Recommendation 2: Facilitate syncing across devices instead of backs-up that erase previous versions. This is a essential feature of an app that promotes productivity and self-improvement.,1
Awesome app for boosting productivity. You are your character!!,1
"Great app! Two suggestions though: for weekly tasks, it should tell you how many more you have to do that week to complete your goal. 2nd, the UI for tasks with Daily Goals is pretty bad. Instead of it opening a window for you to enter a number, it should use the check box circle to tell you how many more you have. If you have a daily goal of 3, clicking on the circle once should fill up the ring by 1/3. Clicking it again brings it to 2/3 full. And then the last time, it should do the checkmark.",1
Exactly what I needed!!!,1
Good for everyday maintenance,1
"Great app! Been looking for a customizable rpg-themed tasks app since forever and found it! Suggestion: some overdue tasks should automatically count as fail, especially the ones that repeat daily.",1
"So fun, I genuinely love this app",1
I have ADHD and I can't tell how thankful I am for thos app. It's really helping me in ways I couldn't imagine. The gamification helps me keep focused while the gadget makes me see what I have to do as soon as I turn my phone on. Really helpful. Thanks for the app. Keep the nice work.,1
Love this app. Helps me focus on my tasks and get them accomplished.,1
Looks great so far. Can't wait to use it on the daily!! Also I'm very interested on what areas this app will help me balance out.,1
Fun little app worth a few bucks a month. I'll see how it goes. So far I'm liking the interface and looking for a book to read on day one and two was interesting. Hmm. Wish there was more preset tasks just the same though.,1
I'm really enjoying using this app. I have tasks that both increase and decrease skills and it's helping me to see patterns that I need to change.,1
EXELLENCE FOR THIS APP,1
this app has really helped me stay motivated to get things done! and it makes it super fun! highly recommendüëç,1
Just a really nice motivational app :),1
Definitely one of the few very best self-improvement Android apps. The main positive trait of the DIN app is the insanely high level of customization.,1
Love how you can modify everything.,1
"I love the app!! I wish I could skip tasks/habits for upcoming days, skip an entire day and/or multiple habits/tasks at once, check off a checklist at once, have the ability to skip item(s) on a checklist, for tasks/habits to go in chronological order once created, and reminder/alarm to not go off if task/habit already checked/skipped/failed. One issue I'm having is adjusting the alarm volume. It won't let me. It's super loud, but it won't change when I adjust it. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Almost perfect. In love. This has unironically had a major help in changing my life. I'm serious, this has helped my scheduling, chores, and weightloss. I was motivated to do food prep but I always forgot, so I got this app and set a reminder for every 4 days and boom, the habit is easily part of my life now. I bought the premium which may I say, thank GOD it's a one time purchase. The only critique is I wish the notifications would be more personalized. Maybe with the personalized icons.",1
"It's an app for nerds, to be sure., I LOVE how customizable it is and how you can use or ignore whatever features you want. This is my favorite to-do list app",1
I found it very intuitive and easy to use. It does what it is meant to do without being annoying or invasive like some other scheduling apps.,1
"I really enjoy and look forward to using this app. I create a new icon every 2 character levels & that's a big motivator for me. I do have 2 things I wish were incorporated, 1, I wish there was a way to manually reorder the individual tasks in the hero tab (if there is one, I haven't figured it out) & 2, I'd like to be able to manually dock individual Characteristics & Skills that are falsely inflated due to bad impact percentages (on my part) from when I was figuring it out. Worth every penny",1
Incredible app. Helps keep track of my day. Thanks dev!,1
Cool,1
"This app is simple and straight to the point. Quick and easy to use and tinker with and a lot of fun to have overall. If had any suggestions it would be to have the ability to have multiple accounts but other than that I completely recommend this app. There's a lot of features although, yes a lot of them are premium they balance out quite well and it's not that irritating as other apps to use the non-premium version.",1
I have Adult ADD and this app has been incredible at helping me set tasks and start new productive habits.,1
"This is a great, powerful and wonderful app. The ability to make a task subtask of multiple parents is wonderful and unique. It allows for specifying a task as predecessor for multiple tasks. The skills and characteristics stats allows us to instantly find out which areas we are yet to focus more on and immensely helps in planning. First of all ability to have infinite levels of subtasks itself is a great feature.",1
"Met all my expectations, lots of options available (level status, skill modifiers such as difficulty, decay etc. statistics and many icons and colors). Best app I found so far to gamify my life and reach my goals.",1
The best,1
"It's good, you just hafta do it. Hella customization options. You can cheat... if you want. Multiplayer parties would be fun. big stuff stylized as boss fights could be fun. 'learned lessons' you find important to keep in mind could be remembered as artifacts.",1
"I like Rpg video games and i realised that life is a Rpg game too so i will only play it.This app is amazing,it will make my life look like even more Rpg game.",1
"Tried 3 top rated (at time)... as once a 'pen & paper' Dungeon Master, I found this app to be a nice blend of functionality and fantasy... The interface is user friendly, and sub-screens are nicely inter-connected, easy to navigate. A great app, even the ads are done well...!",1
"It is the best app available to gamify your life. It requires integrity, but everyone I cheat myself I reset it, which drives me to work even harder and do more. It suggested a good amount of stuff, but you can take the framework, and completely change every single thing which is what makes it incredible. The layout and format is also clean, while being unique. I think everyone should use this around the world.",1
"As someone who struggles with the negative effects of ADHD and motivation, this helps massivley to ensure I do tasks, thank you. For everyone who likes RPGs, it takes some setup time to personalise, but it is worth it and I would reccomend it. Only feedback/request I could have is that it would be nice if 'skills' could be nested within other skills, e.i a piano skill nested under the music skill which feeds into a characteristic.",1
Fun to use once you get the hang of it. I been using it over 2 years now.,1
So far so good,1
"Helpfull app. I made a lot of progress in my life...i mean game with it :p I like easy and clear interface, but pls fix this issue with displaying uneven number of tasks in calendar-main page. I skipped a lot of tasks without knowing :(",1
"Great app! It really helps me to get things done. I have a few recommendations to make. It would be great if we could edit the stats of our hero. For example I want to lose/gain weight. I'd be nice if I can change the weight of my hero and have achievements for that. Also, it'd be nice to toggle the ""success level"" of each task. Let's say I have to do my homework. If it turns out that I did them with no mistakes I can get more XP and/or reward.",1
"Hello, I really enjoyed using this app. Last time I used, it wasn't have much these features. But now it's doing great, though I feel like it lacks something. I'd like to make a suggestion. * I think it's a great addition if we can categorize skills, just like how skill trees work, as if they belong ""in the same element"". * Character relationship feature would be very useful if the hero aims to improve relationship. Just like how Stardew Valley friendship works.",1
"This app is simple and straight to the point. Quick and easy to use and tinker with and a lot of fun to have overall. If had any suggestions it would be to have the ability to have multiple accounts but other than that I completely recommend this app. There's a lot of features although, yes a lot of them are premium they balance out quite well and it's not that irritating as other apps to use the non-premium version.",1
"This app is the best. I remember a while back I made a review criticizing the lack of widget details as well.

I love it and it's been a huge source of motivation in my life for a couple years now! Thank you so much!",1
"Needed something to track and push me to do tasks. So far I'm finding it useful. Love the idea of gameifing tasks, and spending gold for rewards. No gold no reward, unless you cheat, but then your picky cheating yourself. Will be considering purchasing this if continues to be useful.",1
"I am autistic, have adhd and musculoskeletal issues. Recently I have neglected myself in favour of my family.

I will recommend to the mental health team to suggest to other clients. Thank you so much for creating an app that is improving my life. I will buy premium when I can afford it to support your ongoing work.",1
"So helpful! I've tried a ton of other apps that gamify tasks, and this is the first one that has done the trick to make me more productive. I really love the skills system and the custom rewards. I can't believe I'm having fun doing chores.",1
"Great app. Personally, I could take or leave the RPG elements. They're neat, but I was primarily looking for something with fully editable tasks in a list form, plus notifications, and wasn't geared toward families. And this does the trick!",1
"Met all my expectations, lots of options available (level status, skill modifiers such as difficulty, decay etc. statistics and many icons and colors). Best app I found so far to gamify my life and reach my goals.",1
"I like the app. I'm just someone who wants to be as productive as possible, and this app can make it more enjoyable to do so. I also admire the creativity of the app and have already purchased a subscription, which is very well priced. Unfortunately, there are bad reviews, but ultimately, this is meant to make your life like a game, and most games need to make revenue so keep that in mind before a negative review.",1
"Helpfull app. I made a lot of progress in my life...i mean game with it :p I like easy and clear interface, but pls fix this issue with displaying uneven number of tasks in calendar-main page. I skipped a lot of tasks without knowing :(",1
"Tried 3 top rated (at time)... as once a 'pen & paper' Dungeon Master, I found this app to be a nice blend of functionality and fantasy... The interface is user friendly, and sub-screens are nicely inter-connected, easy to navigate. A great app, even the ads are done well...!",1
"I love the app. Got premium and fell in love with it even more however a suggestion I have is for task input to be easier like adding templates where skills can be preset as there's too many unnecessary steps when it comes to adding tasks which can make the process draining. To set the duration of tasks it takes you to a new scree where you have to uncheck ""whole day"" then go to another screen for the duration...this gets taxing after many tasks..........",1

The only app I know of that makes chores fun!,1
This is definitely the best app I've ever used. I totally enjoy it and this is the reason of my improvement.,1
"I do enjoy the app, but like other guys I too believe that it need some animation and a happier atmosphere, but it's very practical",1
My first impressions are all great. I hope this app helps to fight procrastination,1
Do what rhymes why duck my stick (Nice app),1
Can you make the sub tasks optional. Like an extra side quest wich dousnt need to be done .,1
"A great, fun little app for productivity and learning new habits! It does take a small amount of set up but it's worth it. I also love that you can outright buy the premium version for a one time fee rather than having to fork over a subscription forever, although the subscriptions aren't super expensive either. All in all, definitely my favourite productivity app!",1
"-I have never seen an app that had such a great impact on my life, thank you for creating thisüôè‚ô•Ô∏è -I have few notes I hope that can help making this app better and better : 1 -please create a smart watch version of the app (watch face) that can show user level and status and status picture, etc, I'm willing to pay for it 2-sometimes adding subtasks in the subtasks view, after confirming, the tasks are not added and I have to do it again 3-when I turn on auto sync the app becomes very laggy ‚ô•Ô∏èüî•",1
Literally the Best app out there. Absolutely life changing,1
Fun way to get and keep you motivated to accomplish your daily tasks. I would highly recommend.,1
This is great for my ADHD,1
Awesome,1
"I'm gonna sound like an advertisement from how much i love this app. It DOES ITS JOB in the sense that it makes productivity a game. I have ADHD and this makes impossible tasks fun, the rewards feature helps the most. I also love the fact that it doesn't try to look clean and polished and ~aesthetic~, rather it feels more natural in its layout. The only downside is that it takes a while to get used to how the different features work, but that's only minor. Love this app immensely.",1
"I had another app similar to this, and chose this one because of the additional skills function that levels up our attributes. It feels more in depth and immersive having these options. The only thing that could make this app better is custom theme colors that I can pick myself. It'd also be preferable if the lifetime access price was around $10-20 instead of $30+ that it currently is.",1

thank you its everything I have ever wanted,1
Perfect,1
It has helped me greatly to organize my tasks and not confuse. 100% recommended,1
This app is fun when it comes to helping with my ADHD. It want to complete tasks so I can watch my character grow.,1

Makes working towards your goals more satisfying,1

Perfect for what I need. I have a hard time keeping track of things so thank you!,1
"Hello, I really enjoyed using this app. Last time I used, it wasn't have much these features. But now it's doing great, though I feel like it lacks something. I'd like to make a suggestion. * I think it's a great addition if we can categorize skills, just like how skill trees work, as if they belong ""in the same element"". * Character relationship feature would be very useful if the hero aims to improve relationship. Just like how Stardew Valley friendship works.",1

Good for practicing volleyball,1
"Hi, very good app. just It has only one chart for characteristics. which also shows for the period of one day. Please add more charts with monthly and weekly timeframes for characteristics. This makes the program much more attractive. In this case, the program will be complete and without defects. üî•üî•üî• I am waiting for the new version üî•üî•üî•",1
Good,1
"Solid app, could use a few QOL improvements, two examples I can think of. 1) When viewing the calander layout, have indicators on the days that have tasks, habits, and such allowing the app to replace default calendar apps 2) allow recurring(tasks) to be switched in the editor menu. Would be nice to have the task be convertible from one type to another without having to remake the task. Maybe these are already in the app, but after messing around for some time, I have yet to find the option.",1
"Great app, very intuitive. I use it for work and really like the task portion of it. I paid for premium because it was cheap, worth it, and thankfully not a subscription. I am not able to edit a start date for a reoccurring task, but it is easy enough to just delete and make a new task. Requests: 1. I would love to be able to set up reoccurring tasks for times such as 2nd Tuesday, last Friday, etc. 2. I would also love to see last completed date for a reoccurring task.",1
"This is a great app! The ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome. There are just 2 things I'd really like to see that would make this a 5-star review for me: 1) Full editing options (currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items), and 2) A help/glossary feature. I'm not sure exactly what the link icon means, as it is 0 on items I've not done or done once, but 1 on items that I've done twice or three times.",1
"It is a nice app. But, if it is not the premium version you will get limited number of tasks.",1
I need hourly habits,1
Helpful app for creating tasks and healthy habits and runs smoothly,1
I like the app but I think there should be an option where u can set a task and select the days you need to do it so you can select every day or something,1
It's just the app. The real change is upon you.,1
"Pretty good app, but one thing that should be fixed ASAP, is that say you have a task entered in to do today, and you set an alarm reminder to go off at 1 pm. However you end up finishing the task early and complete it and check it off by 11am. The app registers that you've completed the task, but the reminder alarm still goes off at 1pm! Completing a task and checking it off should automatically turn off all the reminders for that task.",1
"Loving it so far. Gives me the motivation I need to get my tasks done and reach my goals. Could use more category spaces and icons, but thats the only downside I could find :]",1
"Really loving this app Statistics are good No ads In app Password protection is available We can create single or recurrent tasks, habbits with or without Statistics",1
Amazing,1
Very useful!,1
"Pretty awesome app. My biggest gripe: No smartwatch version! I forced it on my watch and the UI makes it impossible to use (and it constantly crashes.) Please for the love of the future, add smart watch support!!!!!!!!!!!",1
If you may add any sound when I click the completion of a habit. It would be great.,1
They ate,1
"Great App. Helps me so much tracking all my health data. One improvement that can be thought of is, your app only documents positive outcome in statistics (at least bar graph). If you could find bar graph for all possible values of a habit then it would be give so much insight. But otherwise GREAT work.",1
Till when the 100% transparent widget??,1
"I would give it 5 stars but I set my reminders for the afternoon and evening, only to have a 3:00 am notification wake me up to complete all my habits!",1
This may be the best looking app I've ever seen.,1
"The design has a tangible sleek feeling, it makes the notifications encouraging. The layout for the tables which show data & tasks are pretty organized, the data isn't as detailed as I expected though. A few common statistics, excluding time of completion & other details. Options for a task are detailed. The limit of 7 habits is far to low without premium. Some suggestions are, a way to copy tasks so we don't have to remake one time tasks, & being able to conduct multiple sessions for a habit.",1
"I've used a lot of habit tracking apps over the years, but have found HabitNow to be the best. The interface is clean and easy to use and was made even better with the recent update. Edititng days that you've forgotten to track is easy to do in the 'today view' and in the calendar view of each habit, and it clearly shows hard fails for everyday habits, and soft fails for habits that only need to be completed so many times a week. Plus, the statistics screen is a clear and informative overview of how you're doing with each habit. I'm leaving off a star purely for the fact that I think units could be implemented better. Currently you can set a number of units to be completed a number of times per week or month (which is great for glasses of water, or press-ups etc). But what I think would be useful is to also be able to track units cumulatively over a week or month. This would be useful for habits such as walking a set number of miles, making a number of phone calls, maybe even writing a number of words - over the course of a month or week.",1
"Been using it for a day now, the overall User Experience is pretty cool, though a pity that has got only 8 habits you can put in. Has other functionality which can also be used, and pretty much flexible",1
It's best app I ever found for tracking my habits. I am satisfied with this and also able to follow my routine in better way. Just it will be great if we can add task or event to my Google Calendar.,1
It's amazing! I love that it is a lifetime premium subscription but please make it available on iOS!!! I told my sister about it and she instantly asked where to find it but she couldn't cause she's on iOS... ü´§,1
Best app for productivity so far -but I wish rather than priority we had options to add points for certain tasks/habits and have an overall score for the week/month analysis Also it's a pity we can't have metrics for recurring tasks,1
"I've actually deleted and redownloaded this app bc of its planning features compared to other to do apps. Only criticism is I wish you could change the way you evaluate progress after you've made the task, but everything else makes up for it.",1
"Great app, purchased on day one. Need some improvementa though. Graph font is too small. Graph need to show average unit of measurable habit. Say e.g average time spend on meditation per week. Thanks.",1
I've only been using this app for one day. I like it more than similar apps I've tried. Seriously considering purchasing the Premium subscription. $5.99 for life is a very good price for customers!,1
"Loving it so far. Gives me the motivation I need to get my tasks done and reach my goals. Could use more category spaces and icons, but thats the only downside I could find :]",1
"really nice app Does what it¬¥s supposed too, paid for pro but im missing 1 very important feature. why make lists if i can¬¥t put things in list ? i wanna put recuring task in a morning routine list, but it doesnt seem to work / there doesnt seem to be a way to put task into a list which kinda sucks :( since i have multiple routines for different times of day.",1
"It's a good app, if you have only one device. I installed it on my tablet only to find out that it only backs up to the cloud every other day, and there's no support for multiple devices so I can only use it on my phone. Other than that it's a great app.",1
"Great App. Loved using it. Bought the premium version. Just wanted to add a feature that when the alarm rings. There should be an option to tick the task as ""done"" on the screen. The alarm rings and i have to dismiss it and then go open the app and tick it ""done"". I'd rather do it when the alarm screen itself.",1
A wonderful application. I hope the Arabic language will be added in the next update,1
Absolutely finest habit tracking app with great UI and visuals. Only cons is you can't add tasks directly. You have to go teough 2-3 steps for that.,1
"Great app thanks for the developers, I will give five stars if the Arabic language included in the coming updates.",1
The free version is very limited and only allows you to create up to 7 habits/reoccurring tasks.,1
Best app for productivity so far -but I wish rather than priority we had options to add points for certain tasks/habits and have an overall score for the week/month analysis Also it's a pity we can't have metrics for recurring tasks,1
Helpful,1
Helped me to start waking daily and has been tremendously useful,1
"Difficult to use some times, but alarms and notifications are what made me love this one.",1
It's a good app I really like it,1
"It's an fantastic app for building & maintaining daily habits effectively. In addition, it's user-friendly interface, customizable features & support make it an standout.",1
Great App and Experience. Glad I've got the Premium version Recommendation 1: An Official PC version. Those wanting to use this app on a PC must use an emulator (third-party app). Recommendation 2: Facilitate syncing across devices instead of backs-up that erase previous versions. This is a essential feature of an app that promotes productivity and self-improvement.,1
"I really like this app, however I dont know if I am not good or if it is not possible but I have one problem. For example, I have the version in which I paid, I can add subactivities to a bigger activity. But I'd like to have a function in which I can make these subactivities different days which is not possible. I need to do the subactivities the same day in order to reach my goal even if that's not what I want when I add subactivities. I dont know how to resolve that",1
Excellent app. Especially I like the add function for measurable habits. I need not calculate every time I make an entry. Suggestion : 1. Can we make this 'add' function permanent once selected. Because'replace' function becomes default for every new entry. I've to select 'add' every time now. 2. Categories option at the bottom menu seems redundant as the option is available already in the top left menu. So the bottom menu space can be used for something else,1
"Generally good, but please add a heatmap for the whole year to have a better view on progress and consistency.",1
I've only been using this app for one day. I like it more than similar apps I've tried. Seriously considering purchasing the Premium subscription. $5.99 for life is a very good price for customers!,1
"Great app, purchased on day one. Need some improvementa though. Graph font is too small. Graph need to show average unit of measurable habit. Say e.g average time spend on meditation per week. Thanks.",1
"Brilliant this app is fantastic - all but replaced Google Calendar. Habits are easy to track and progress reported visually through the statistics screens. Tasks are enhanced with the use checklists - great feature, allowing complex tasks to be split into smaller steps and progress reported. Only reason for 4 & not 5 stars is the alerts are clumsy to set up and it would be a huge improvement to the app if when the habit/task is completed early it also cancelled the alert.",1
Absolutely finest habit tracking app with great UI and visuals. Only cons is you can't add tasks directly. You have to go teough 2-3 steps for that.,1
"Very good app but i like, support for smartwatch ( Samsung)",1
It's really a good app,1
I like the app.,1
Good,1
Solid app,1
"Loved this app, very usefull for creating habits and track. simple and user friendly",1
"I love it, no ads, perfect. Just a lot of features are pro. It only costs $6 though so great!",1
My first impression of this app is good. Better than all apps I've tried before .,1
"I love the app!! I wish I could skip tasks/habits for upcoming days, skip an entire day and/or multiple habits/tasks at once, check off a checklist at once, have the ability to skip item(s) on a checklist, for tasks/habits to go in chronological order once created, and reminder/alarm to not go off if task/habit already checked/skipped/failed. One issue I'm having is adjusting the alarm volume. It won't let me. It's super loud, but it won't change when I adjust it. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"The free version limits u on how many habits u can have. I bought the premium. I think it's good, but I really wish there's a way to track partially completed habits and to personalise the colour I want displayed on the statistics (e.g for partially done habit). I wanted to also track my mood so I would have liked again to be able to have different colours on the calendar based on 4example what u select in a list. Also I'd like when avoiding a bad habit to be able 2 track the fails & not success",1
Not too many ads I see - I like it,1
Like the app. QQ. How I schedule biweekly Saturday habits??,1
The app really helps to maintain a consistent routine.,1
"Nice app helping with tracking habits. I tried to buy the premium to overcome the limitations of 7 habits only in free, but the button is not working. Support a habit that occurs repeatedly on the same day, e.g., brushing teeth is missing. To overcome this, I had to add the same habit multiple times. Archived habits counted part of the 7 allowed habits for free. Can this limitation be changed to exclude archived habits",1
Stopwatch is so inaccurate. Please fix it,1
The app in one word Quality. It has what I need when I need except few minor personal features but the rest is just üíØ. I would recommend the app if you are looking for some minimal and cluster free User Experience to focus on you habit tracking.,1
"Brilliant this app is fantastic - all but replaced Google Calendar. Habits are easy to track and progress reported visually through the statistics screens. Tasks are enhanced with the use checklists - great feature, allowing complex tasks to be split into smaller steps and progress reported. Only reason for 4 & not 5 stars is the alerts are clumsy to set up and it would be a huge improvement to the app if when the habit/task is completed early it also cancelled the alert.",1
"Great App! But adding an explicit day counter to set goals would be cool. Also, having the ability to use the app as a calendar in addition to habits/tasks would be pertect!",1
"A little over-engineered, but I like it. If there was some way to reduce the amount of user actions/taps to navigate settings, or if there were quick gestures, that would be stellar.",1
"you can only view monthly progress ONE HABIT AT A TIME (the rest of the tool works very well). the global monthly calendar view doesn't show green for completed days. you should be able to see that you completed ALL your habits/tasks, on the global monthly calendar. I'm glad development is continuing on the app. I'll keep using it in hopes of the global calendar being updated.",1
"This looks like a great program, one question though, I can't figure out how to set up a habit or task that repeats every other week (i.e. 1 day every 2 weeks). Let me know if I am not seeing how to do this or if it is a feature with premium (very willing to upgrade to premium just want to make sure the app will meet my needs first). Great work with this app.",1
Been using it everyday to track my project progress which is amazing since I always forget apps like these. I am able to schedule alarms for start and end times for some habits which is super useful. Only issue I found is that the alarms only pop-up when I open the app so they never go off on time because of this. Which is why I gave 4 stars. I need the alarms or I forget.,1
"I bought the full version and I quite enjoy it. Some suggestions would be to make the effects more dynamic, to make the app more enticing to use with frequency. The Sweepy app is a good example of making goal setting and completion fun (I love their mascot). I think this one could do something to give more life to its atmosphere.",1
Wonderful App with great features. I've purchased the premium version in order to have more customization and I was very pleased. I would like the developers to consider allowing Routines to be duplicated after they are created. I want to make a tue/thur routine that is similar to a mon/wed routine. Another recommendation includes allowing the user to adjust the placement/priority of each task within a routine. Those updates would make this app unstoppable!,1
Looks like the best app so far but a feature that would be incredible is some option to send or share with others four accountability. I'm a coach and it would be great if my students could share their progress with me. This would be beneficial for teachers and anyone that is trying to break a bad habit.,1
"Super happy with the app! Bought Premium right away. Just one feature I would like to see. I know this may seem strange, but I would like recurring tasks. I somewhat expected it. Habits are behaviors that help me work towards who I want to become. Tasks are just to-dos. Thanks for quick response! Habits change behavior. Tasks are simply to do's towards goals. If you can make that strategy change you open yourself up to be supported by major productivity leaders.",1
"I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?",1
Full featured habit tracker at a reasonable price. I tried about 10 different habit apps and this was the best for my purposes. The only other apps that appealed to me in this realm were 10x the price or required a recurring subscription. Pro: -Highly customizable habits -Very functional widget -Rich statistic tracking -Very reasonable price for premium Con: -Dark mode is not AMOLED dark -No syncing with other devices Either of the above two features would make this a solid 5 stars from me.,1
"Love the Categories & choice of custom name/icon/color!! There's something about seeing my tasks in a lovely format like this that makes my entire life feel more manageable. My one and only suggestion: I really wish the Categories tab allowed me to tap on a category and see all the tasks in that category. Maybe you can, and I'm just missing something? I like the app so much that I'm trying to work around that singular shortfall though. Free version has been incredible so far, too! Recommended!",1
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.,1
"Overall pretty nice, simple and customizable. A few things lacking in the first 30 minutes of use: - No sync between devices. This one really bothered me :( - Can't schedule a specific monthly task. Ex: Task on the last day of the month (aka 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st depending on the month). I usually take care of all my bills then and could use a reminder Next day EDIT: - No custom order to tasks. I want to see them in the order I expect to complete them, but I don't have a specific due time.",1
this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,1
"I really like the features but really struggle with the notifications working. I understand my phone is partly to blame but I have made sure it's on ""unrestricted"" so it's not optimized or put to sleep and I still don't get them sometimes. If I don't get them I forget to track which makes it pointless. I have the paid version so I can track more but that didn't help at all due to this issue.",1
"Thanks. I went ahead and paid to try the widget.Category colors are still limited to bright colors. Free colors horridly garish and no way to test how widget works without buying premium. I just want a way to have a simple widget but I can click throughout the day for habits and tasks. This app how does simplicity I'm looking for, and the price is fair if I decide I want to upgrade to more customization. However if I can't try out the widget without paying,",1
"An way to take notes in-app, an option to add a timer for each event in a routine, and a setting to change the widget's transparency for premium users would boost this rating to 5 stars. Until then the functionality is great; some UI needs to be updated for the simple style more, but the app works as intended and is intuitive to use without much of a learning curve",1
"I'm glad to find an app to help me monitor my habits! While I like the app so far, I have some suggestions for what I think would be nice to have. 1) a check-all button for checklists, 2) the ability to permanently reorder checklist items instead of just the a to z button, 3) a way to mark checklist and daily task items as fail instead of leaving them unmarked, and 4) ability to duplicate for habits I want to do multiple times a day. Excited to continue with HabitNow!",1
"Great app, bought the premium version and have been using it for a couple days now. I love the interface and it looks great! A couple features I wish it had so far are the ability to choose what alarm sound for reminders and being able to change the order of things on a checklist. Otherwise, looking forward to using this app daily!",1
"I just found this app, and it's amazing! I already upgraded to premium because it's a good price. It's so colorful, and I love the little icons! The only thing I ask is pleeease add a calendar widget so I can replace Google Calendars. And give it an option to be able to choose which tasks can be displayed on the calendar. Thank you!",1
"Loving this app. A few suggestions: 1. A way to more easily filter my tasks. At the moment, my agenda is extremely cluttered and hard to manage. If I could create a ""View"" (or some easily toggleable filter), it would be a massive help. 2. Some tasks are due by a certain date, but can be completed any time before that. Something like ""Pending task,"" but with a due date would help clean up my Calendar view. 3. Group tasks / accountability? Probably difficult server-side, but food for thought.",1
"Great format & UI, a little glitchy when trying to backspace in the initial task checklist set up. It would be nice if you could reorder the items in the checklist, as it seems the only way to change the order is to delete everything & start over. It would also be nice to be able to duplicate (copy/past) tasks as opposed to starting from scratch if you have similarly worded tasks.",1
"Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.",1
"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.",1
"Nearly perfect! This app offers me just about everything I had been looking for in other apps. Not only can I create habit forming routines that I can track, I can also add repeating and non repeating tasks separate from the habit tracker. The Pomodoro style timer is a nice addition. Plus it's really aesthetically pleasing. My only one gripe is that you can't sort out task lists once created, in my desired order. This isn't a total deal breaker, but it sure detracts from the over all experience.",1
"Overall the app has helped me stay on track and remember what I need to get done. The settings for the repeat habits is confusing, I gave up on it, and now enter as separate tasks. I will eventually figure it out, I just have to take the time to go through it slower. The month view - are we supposed to see any indication of a task on a given day? My task days are blank. A suggestion for future updates: ‚Ä¢ Built in notepad to make lists or to jot notes down (I don't remember anything üòÑ)",1
"This app is effectively a task organizer. You create a ""habit"" you want to track and you can set reminders based on time spent, yes/no completion, or quantity. Set your reminders & then the app will ping you to do these things whenever you schedule them. On one hand, it's helpful. On the other, I don't see why you couldn't just do this with your calendar app. A nice feature to add would be to let habits be checked as complete based on satisfying a list of subtasks. All in all, it's OK.",1
"This app has been fantastic for my ADHD brain. It has almost everything I could want in an app - my suggestions of what would make it even better would be to have a 3rd category (task, habit) as appointments. I would also like the ability to pause or defer tasks. Also it would be cool to be able to track certain things that I don't want to necessarily call a habit, but would like to mark everyday or Everytime that thing occurs without having some sort of numerical goal attached to it",1
"After using a lot of different habit trackers, I'm really enjoying this one. I like the layout & customization. I got premium & think it's worth it. A few criticisms: 1. recurring tasks not completed should move to the next day. 2. It should be an option to complete a habit on a different day to make up for the day missed. Ex, If I miss a workout on Tues, I can make it up Wed & have my tracker stay accurate. 3. You should be able to swipe left or right on the home screen to move between days.",1
"Just downloaded it, am willing to pay to try it out, but I agree with a lot of the previous criticisms, it would be great to manually order the tasks. For example. Everything I want to track ends up being a long list. I have some daily goals, some weekly, some reminders to NOT do something. I would like to be able to pin the reminders at the top, have the daily habits after that, then the scheduled dailies. Below that in possibly another section, the weekly goals. Organization is key",1
"Have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium! I love it. But a few needed suggestions. An option to make a task recurring. And also maybe on one same habit, have different times per day: weekday /weekend. And I can't seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup. I also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do. Maybe a swipe would be nicer.",1
"This app is easy to use, helpful, reasonable about what is free or premium (and cheap). Suggestions: 1. When you long tap ANY habit/task, description should show up along with the notes, add reminder, reset entry etc on the details that pull up 2. Tasks that appear only after others are completed. This could reasonably be premium along with subtasks. 3. Due dates for pending tasks so they disappear after a certain date if not completed. Should be in details (see #1) 4. Search/filter by category.",1
Great habit and scheduling app,1
"Love the app and widget; I'm lazy so widget for checking of items is a must for me. I'd like the ability to use a color picker instead of predefined category colors. Also, it'd be great to be able to collapse by category and see stats from a category overlaid. I'd also like to be able to manually change order and have multi-category habits/tasks please.",1
"Just started using it and bought premium but have a few suggestions. - Each habit height is very small and would like to be able to resize them or even have a grid option where each habit/task is a big button. - Biometric unlock - In settings, pressing back from ""Customize"" page takes me back to main page instead of the settings page. - Would like to be able to sort habits/tasks from the main page without having to go through several pages in settings. - Show categories in grid not one line",1
This is the best!! Honestly lIve never felt so organized. My problem is that the habits or tasks don't say like selected tasks or habits so it is hard for me to input different things in different lists.,1
"It's an fantastic app for building & maintaining daily habits effectively. In addition, it's user-friendly interface, customizable features & support make it an standout.",1
"Almost perfect: Please add a feature such that when I complete my daily habit, it shows my current streak. (Right now, it is hidden in the statistics section, which is not that motivational)",1
Good. Only thing is it would be handy to have a calculation of time between dates and to be able to set long term goals where it can count down until goal achieved. Then perhaps within the long term goal be able to set the daily habits and 'To Dos' to achieve that goal.,1
"I installed it yesterday only and I'm really loving it, so good features to track your habits. Except one thing i.e we can't login other devices and if we uninstalled the app for formatting the phone device can we get the backups of all data of habitnow again if I installed again? This is the reason I want to login in my laptop. Rather than this, it is so great app and helps so much in progress",1
"Pretty awesome app. My biggest gripe: No smartwatch version! I forced it on my watch and the UI makes it impossible to use (and it constantly crashes.) Please for the love of the future, add smart watch support!!!!!!!!!!!",1
The app in one word Quality. It has what I need when I need except few minor personal features but the rest is just üíØ. I would recommend the app if you are looking for some minimal and cluster free User Experience to focus on you habit tracking.,1
"App is great, I've even bought premium and it's great. I noticed one issue regarding timer on my oneplus 8t with android 13. There is some kid of optymalization and timer usually pause in background and doesn't work. For example I run stopwatch in habbitnow and after 10 min I see 2 min took in this timer. I changed permissions to enable run in background but it won't help. Any idea how to solve this issue?",1
"Great customisation and quick to get into. Would like to be able to move the day's task more fluidly by dragging and having it automatically adjust priority, rather than having to manually change it each time, it slows down the process when you have many tasks.",1
Love the app overall but would loooove if there was a way to like copy or duplicate tasks. Sometimes I have a big checklist I want to copy because one factor is different and it's a pain you have to type it all out twice. Could be cool to be able to duplicate tasks then be able to edit them.,1
"Nice app helping with tracking habits. I tried to buy the premium to overcome the limitations of 7 habits only in free, but the button is not working. Support a habit that occurs repeatedly on the same day, e.g., brushing teeth is missing. To overcome this, I had to add the same habit multiple times. Archived habits counted part of the 7 allowed habits for free. Can this limitation be changed to exclude archived habits",1
"I'm Premium. me not rating it higher can be chalked down to: * No ability to set ""Start of day""... Meaning in order for the app to prove productive to me I have to do everything ahead of midnight... This is not conducive to the needs of the user base. Even Habitica has this. * Cloud Sync but no Web? If you can sync data to somewhere you can offer the ability to do so from a browser. Especially to Premium users. * I have yet to try it but I sincerely hope the backup is human readable.",1
"Excellent App. I bought the premium too, and has amazing options to track your habits ! There is a suggestion. I have a lot of habits and What happens is that for example in my 20 habits if I am trying to archive a habit number 17, then after archiving the Habit when I press the back button the home screen returns to the first habit it should not happen and should remember the position I was last in",1
"Great App, No doubt, small suggestion or scope of Improvement - The bottom menu doesn't need catagories section since it will be used very rarely, it could be in the main menu on top, the statistics section could be useful there, since we are tracking habits.. and to check stats we have to go to each habit and check stats, it would be great to see stats dashboard there...",1
"Great UI overall! With helpful visuals for statistics that are not too complicated and give just the right information, overall the system is very helpful. Small changes like defining and choosing the right colors for certain areas like on the calendar and using universally understood icons can be a lot more helpful.",1
"I'm using the app every day and the widget is very comfortable. It would be nice if you could track not only habits but also other things, e.g. how do I feel today. For this it would be good if you could enter different options as values, e.g. good, medium, bad or a traffic light with green, yellow, red. Since it is not a habit, it should be possible not to set a requirement for repetition.",1
Excellent app. Especially I like the add function for measurable habits. I need not calculate every time I make an entry. Suggestion : 1. Can we make this 'add' function permanent once selected. Because'replace' function becomes default for every new entry. I've to select 'add' every time now. 2. Categories option at the bottom menu seems redundant as the option is available already in the top left menu. So the bottom menu space can be used for something else,1
"Awesome app! What I think could be improved is to have the habits tracked with a graph. Also, instead of answering with a yes or no if the habit was made, maybe to answer with some sort of rating (if you are, or not satisfied with how much you completed, if it makes sense). If not, the app is great, works fantastic for me!",1
"Overall, really useful for tracking tasks. My only issue since last week is my reminder notifications no longer come up at the correct time to remind me to do something unless I'm physically in the app. I've seen this is apparently an issue with phone settings, but I've not changed my settings at all since having the app, so the only thing different is the app updating. I'm not interested in changing my battery saving settings, so if this is the reason, it makes the app a lot less useful now.",1
"Pretty good app, but one thing that should be fixed ASAP, is that say you have a task entered in to do today, and you set an alarm reminder to go off at 1 pm. However you end up finishing the task early and complete it and check it off by 11am. The app registers that you've completed the task, but the reminder alarm still goes off at 1pm! Completing a task and checking it off should automatically turn off all the reminders for that task.",1
"Great App. Loved using it. Bought the premium version. Just wanted to add a feature that when the alarm rings. There should be an option to tick the task as ""done"" on the screen. The alarm rings and i have to dismiss it and then go open the app and tick it ""done"". I'd rather do it when the alarm screen itself.",1
"The free version limits u on how many habits u can have. I bought the premium. I think it's good, but I really wish there's a way to track partially completed habits and to personalise the colour I want displayed on the statistics (e.g for partially done habit). I wanted to also track my mood so I would have liked again to be able to have different colours on the calendar based on 4example what u select in a list. Also I'd like when avoiding a bad habit to be able 2 track the fails & not success",1
"The app is very efficient in what it sets out to do. Therefore I got the premium. I really hoped for some analytics showing which habits I was able to improve on using graphs and numbers. It could have monthly, yearly and overall analysis, might help to encourage and boost on whatever I'm working hard on. Thank you.",1
"I really like this app. It's easy to use. However when I set reminders, I wish they would not remind me if I've already checked off that item. It makes the reminders kind of annoying. Like if I've already taken my vitamins and checked it off before 10:00 a.m., why would it go ahead and send me a reminder at 10:00 a.m.? It's the little things that'll get you a five star on this app. Otherwise I'll keep using it and just not use the reminders.",1
"Very good app, and so far the best of the myriad I've tried. I feel like it would be more helpful if habit chains were more prominent; broken habits vs. long-maintained ones are barely distinguishable. But usability and native functions are very flexible and it's very well suited to my purposes.",1
"Seems really nice but I tried all 3 timers z d there's no timer/reminder for reoccurring or daily tasks! You have to enter each day as a new entry. Example: I have a daily prayer and Bible Reading. I couldn't find how to set it to remind me everyday. Most of my tasks are daily. This app seems to only accept NEW tasks on a daily basis. So, I'm unable to use this app. Bummer also, that the pro price is a good price!",1
"I've been using it for a day after trying out a few different habit trackers and I love it. I only wish there was a way to change the notification and alarm ringtones, as I don't like the default alarm ringtones on my phone and I can't change them in system settings.",1
"Very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks. Have already replaced my old task app for HabitNow. Glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing. I've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits. If these capabilities don't exist, would love to see these as improvements.",1
"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)... Add this and app will be more solid... And I may jump into Premium! Keep it up!",1
"This really my 1st task/habbit tracker I have really given a real try at it. Love it so far; however it only allows 7 total of tacks & habits, than the premuim is $5. Not sure it it's a 1 time or $5 per month. Hate hidden fees. I would pay the $5 if it's a 1 time thang. Love this app, and I could see myself using it for a long time. And recommending it to others üôÇüíô",1
"I'm finding this app helpful for tracking my habits and giving me reminders when I need them. One minor complaint would be with checklist habits; they only seem to mark as ""failed"" if you've partially completed the list - empty checklists are always ""pending,"" even days later. I can't find an option to set the status manually, or e.g. options where I can customise what I want the app to do with empty checklist at the end of the day.",1
Very good üëç,1
